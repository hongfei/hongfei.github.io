For instance, when you’re around someone you love, you will behave very differently than you would around someone you dislike. Likewise, your energy will affect the space around you differently, telling each person you are with someone you love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/being-in-love"&gt;Healthline writer Crystal Raypole noted&lt;/a&gt;, “It may not seem like it, but being in love is a somewhat scientific process. Falling in love involves a lot of hormones, which can supercharge your feelings and make them wildly fluctuate. When you’re around the person you love, increases in dopamine and norepinephrine lead to feelings of pleasure, giddiness, nervous excitement, and euphoria.” Because of this, a woman’s energy will change when she’s around the person she loves the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here are 11 beautiful ways a woman’s energy changes around the person she loves most:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. She undergoes physical changes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/beautiful-ways-womans-energy-changes-around-person-she-loves-most-undergoes-physical-changes.png" alt="woman who is undergoing physical changes" title="beautiful ways a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most she undergoes physical changes" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Yuganov Konstantin | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the first ways that a woman’s energy will change when she’s around the person she loves most is through a change in her physical energy. Things that should be inexplicable, like a faster heartbeat, increased sweating, or shakiness, can be linked to chemical changes in the body. When you’re around the person you love, you don’t stay the same, quite literally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor of human ecology at the University of Texas, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/02/12/love.heart.brain/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Timothy Loving, explained&lt;/a&gt;, “Part of the whole attraction process is strongly linked to physiological arousal as a whole. Typically, that’s going to start with things like increased heart rate, sweatiness, and so on.” Cardiac electrophysiologist &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/02/12/love.heart.brain/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Reginald Ho added&lt;/a&gt; that a rush of adrenaline makes someone’s heart beat faster when they see the person they love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hormonal changes occur in a woman’s body when she sees the person she loves the most. These can have a huge impact on her energy and change it in a beautiful way. A woman around the person she loves most will naturally act differently because she has no other choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/innocent-habits-that-destroy-womans-feminine-energy"&gt;11 Innocent Habits That Destroy A Woman’s Feminine Energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. She feels nervous&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/beautiful-ways-womans-energy-changes-around-person-she-loves-most-feels-nervous.png" alt="woman who feels nervous" title="beautiful ways a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most she feels nervous" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;fizkes | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way a woman’s energy changes around the person she loves most is that she’ll get a bit nervous. The exact level of anxious energy she feels can differ depending on the person, but there’s a good chance she’ll feel some nerves around the person she loves. While some mistake this nervous energy for a general feeling of anxiety, it’s likely that she feels this way because of the person she loves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/do-their-nervous-habits-mean-they-like-me-8722041"&gt;VeryWell Mind writer Sian Ferguson explained&lt;/a&gt; that we all engage in nervous habits, but sometimes they can be a sign of something more. “Nervous habits are those little behaviors people tend to do without even realizing it — like fidgeting, avoiding eye contact, or shifting in their seat. They’re just our natural reactions to feeling uncomfortable or excited.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/do-their-nervous-habits-mean-they-like-me-8722041"&gt;Hannah Owens, LMSW, said&lt;/a&gt; that exhibiting these habits around the person you love is normal. “Feeling a romantic interest in somebody can be anxiety-inducing — you don’t know if they reciprocate the feelings, and you’re focused on making a good first impression, which can be nerve-wracking,” she said. In other words, a woman bringing some nervous energy to the room when she loves someone is normal and can indicate just how interested she is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/beautiful-traits-of-people-who-radiate-good-energy"&gt;11 Beautiful Traits Of People Who Radiate Good Energy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. She is connected to her partner’s emotions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/beautiful-ways-womans-energy-changes-around-person-she-loves-most-connected-partners-emotions.png" alt="woman who is connected to her partner's emotions" title="beautiful ways a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most she is connected to her partner’s emotions" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Rachata Teyparsit | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman in tune with her partner will be connected to their emotions. In fact, she may even absorb those emotions. A woman in love will naturally want to be as close to her partner as possible, even to the point of feeling their same emotions and understanding exactly how they feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marriage and family therapist &lt;a href="https://psychcentral.com/blog/stop-absorbing-other-peoples-emotions"&gt;Amanda Turecek shared&lt;/a&gt; that this can be particularly prevalent for highly sensitive people (HSP). “Research seems to indicate that certain neurons — mirror neurons — act differently in the brains of HSP than in the brains of non-HSP,” she said. “Mirror neurons kick in to gear in our prefrontal cortex, our area of the brain that also controls things like morality and planning around consequences. They encourage us to imitate others and are more active in the brains of HSPs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, highly sensitive people are more likely to imitate those around them. If a woman is an HSP, she may be more likely to absorb emotions from those around her, especially the person she loves most, as that is likely also who she admires the most. This leads to a deep connection and understanding of feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/phrases-brilliant-people-use-soften-energy-get-what-they-want"&gt;11 Phrases Brilliant People Use To Soften Their Energy To Get What They Want&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. She becomes more nurturing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/beautiful-ways-womans-energy-changes-around-person-she-loves-most-becomes-more-nurturing.png" alt="woman who has become more nurturing" title="beautiful ways a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most she becomes more nurturing" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Prostock-studio | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman around the person she loves most may become more nurturing. Scientists have often debated whether women are more nurturing and compassionate than men, something Emma Seppala &lt;a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/are_women_more_compassionate_than_men" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;discussed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/are_women_more_compassionate_than_men" rel="nofollow"&gt; in UC Berkeley’s Greater Good Magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seppala noted that women are often measured to have more oxytocin. “Women may at times have higher levels of oxytocin — sometimes called the ‘cuddle hormone’ or ‘love hormone’ because it is linked to bonding, social connection and monogamy,” she said. “It is produced in women during labor and lactation in women and is believed to trigger bonding and nurturing behaviors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether women are more compassionate than men is still debatable, but based on explanations like these, women have plenty of reasons to be nurturing. Even setting levels of oxytocin aside, many women are nurturing around those they love. Being around the one they love most would surely bring out this reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/early-clues-someone-energy-pure-poison"&gt;15 Early Clues Someone's Energy Is Pure Poison, According To Psychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. She changes to become more like her partner&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/beautiful-ways-womans-energy-changes-around-person-she-loves-most-changes-become-more-like-her-partner.png" alt="woman who changed to become more like her partner" title="beautiful ways a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most she changes to become more like her partner" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;AYO Production | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changing to become more like your partner isn’t necessarily advisable, as everyone should strive to maintain their own autonomy and be their own person. That being said, many women who are in love will make what are sometimes subtle, difficult-to-notice changes to become more like their partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/how-to-do-life/202109/are-you-becoming-more-like-your-partner"&gt;Marty Nemko, PhD, noted&lt;/a&gt; that becoming more like your partner is completely normal over time. In fact, it would probably be strange not to. He advocates taking inventory of oneself so you can determine whether or not those changes are things you feel like celebrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time, a woman’s energy will likely subtly shift to become closer to that of the person she loves the most. Because she spends so much time around that person and is so interested in them, she will naturally lean into their energy and adapt it for her own purposes. Sometimes these changes will be noticeable, and sometimes they’ll be so small you can’t pick them up without paying close attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/types-of-people-not-worth-your-time-or-energy-according-research"&gt;11 Types Of People That Are Not Worth Your Time Or Energy, According To Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. She is more focused on her partner's wants and needs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/beautiful-ways-womans-energy-changes-around-person-she-loves-most-more-focused-partner-what-they-want-need.png" alt="woman who is focused on her partner" title="beautiful ways a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most she is more focused on her partner and what they want and need" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Ground Picture | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a woman loves her partner, she is more in tune with them and what makes them happy. Based on their wants and needs, she will do the things she knows will keep them satisfied. Her energy will change because she will be focused almost solely on her partner, drowning out the noise of the world and keeping her attention where she feels it is most important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/fulfillment-at-any-age/202501/why-its-so-important-to-listen-to-your-partner"&gt;Susan Krauss Whitbourne, PhD, ABPP, cited&lt;/a&gt; a study from Florida State University, which found that “mindfulness in relationships is a key component of being able to take the perspective of your partner. This, in turn, makes partners more compassionate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a woman is focused on her partner, she is more likely to be mindful of them and compassionate towards them. Putting what they want and need before what she wants and needs herself shifts her energy so that it is beautifully centered on her partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/signs-someone-main-character-energy"&gt;7 Harsh Signs Someone Has Main Character Energy And You're Just An Extra, According To Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. She needs to be closer to her partner&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/beautiful-ways-womans-energy-changes-around-person-she-loves-most-needs-closer-partner.png" alt="woman who needs to be closer to her partner" title="beautiful ways a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most she needs to be closer to her partner" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;Aleksandr Rybalko | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a woman is around the person she loves most, she will want to be physically closer to them, making them emotionally closer as well. Doing things like holding hands, hugging, and touching will bring two people closer together. Her energy will change as she feels closer to her partner, and she will feel loved and cherished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An article published in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7485933/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Social and Personality Psychology Compass&lt;/a&gt; noted that relationships affect one’s health for good and bad. “Positive aspects of close relationships, such as intimacy and social support, predict better health outcomes, including longer survival following a breast cancer diagnosis, and improved emotional well-being,” researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a woman feels close to her partner, it will lead to better health outcomes for both. This will give a woman a brighter, lighter energy. As her physical energy changes, so will her emotional and spiritual energy. She will become a light for those around her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/subtle-ways-weak-man-drains-powerful-womans-energy-without-her-realizing"&gt;10 Subtle Ways A Weak Man Drains A Powerful Woman’s Energy Without Her Realizing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;8. She and her partner have an unspoken communication&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/beautiful-ways-womans-energy-changes-around-person-she-loves-most-she-partner-have-unspoken-communication.png" alt="woman who has an unspoken communication with her partner" title="beautiful ways a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most she and her partner have an unspoken communication" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;PeopleImages.com - Yuri A | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman around the person she loves most can tell what they’re thinking without speaking. They will have a form of unspoken communication, like a secret language. For them, it just takes a look to know what the other person is thinking. Words are not required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://online.utpb.edu/about-us/articles/communication/the-influence-of-nonverbal-communication-on-interpersonal-relationships/" rel="nofollow"&gt;The University of Texas Permian Basin said&lt;/a&gt;, “Nonverbal communication can make or break a relationship. A single glance can spark an argument, while a simple touch on the shoulder can mend wounded pride. And sometimes, the sting of words is easier to bear than the weight of crushing silence. There’s power in what goes unspoken.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman who can communicate with her partner without words will have a different energy around her. She feels more assured both in who she is and in her relationship. This confidence can be powerful and radiates to everyone around her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/ways-increase-aura-make-people-instantly-attracted-energy"&gt;11 Ways To Increase Your Aura And Make People Instantly Attracted To Your Energy &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;9. She feels more secure&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-05/beautiful-ways-womans-energy-changes-around-person-she-loves-most-feels-more-secure.png" alt="woman who feels secure with her partner" title="beautiful ways a woman's energy changes around the person she loves most she feels more secure" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;fizkes | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a woman is in a relationship where she feels safe and secure physically, she’s likely also to feel that way emotionally. Her energy will shift to quiet confidence and competence because she knows she is taken care of and space is being held for her. This will, in turn, give her the freedom to be who she really is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://psychcentral.com/blog/how-do-you-create-emotional-safety-in-your-relationships"&gt;PsychCentral writer Sonya Matejko stated&lt;/a&gt;, “Emotional safety is the foundation for a loving and healthy relationship. It’s about establishing trust with another person and feeling safe enough to be open and vulnerable with them. To put it simply, emotional safety is feeling secure enough to truly express yourself with someone and show up as your most authentic self.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a woman is around the person she loves most, she will feel physically and emotionally safe. This sense of security will transform her energy into something more confident and ready for anything. Her energy will be stronger, and so will she.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/stoic-techniques-read-peoples-energy"&gt;7 Stoic Techniques To Read People's Energy Easily&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;10.

She won’t be afraid to share how she’s feeling or unpack her baggage because she knows her partner has her back completely. Her energy shifts in a way that makes her more confident and open to sharing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/why-vulnerability-in-relationships-is-so-important-5193728"&gt;Marriage and family therapist Shari Foos noted&lt;/a&gt;, “Vulnerability is when a person willingly takes the risk to reveal their emotions and weaknesses. This emotional openness is essential in all healthy relationships, as it paves the way for deeper understanding and evokes the empathy necessary for healthy long-term relationships.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a woman feels she can be vulnerable with the person she loves the most, that vulnerable energy will transfer to her everyday life. She’ll become naturally more open and willing to help others feel safe in doing so as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/signs-someone-energy-vampire-only-drain-you"&gt;6 Signs Someone Is An Energy Vampire Who Will Only Drain You&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;11.

Her future will appear more exciting with her partner in the picture, and she will feel better about herself. This excitement will translate into her energy as she lights up the room and the world around her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can feel similar to what some call “new relationship energy.” &lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/new-relationship-energy-8679124"&gt;Psychotherapist Kristin Papa, LCSW, said&lt;/a&gt;, “New relationship energy usually refers to the intense excitement, euphoria, and almost electrical sensation typically experienced at the beginning of a romantic relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New relationship energy causes excitement that shows in a woman’s energy. The great thing is Papa confirmed this feeling can last well after the “honeymoon phase” is over. A woman truly in love can always feel this excitement about her life and relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/signs-give-off-calming-energy"&gt;8 Good Signs You Give Off Calming Energy, According To Psychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mary-Faith Martinez is a writer with a bachelor’s degree in English and Journalism who covers news, psychology, lifestyle, and human interest topics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="midcat-most-popular"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Related Stories From YourTango:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="field field--name-field-content-contains-affiliate field--type-boolean field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="rc-widget-c743d1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>YourTango</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 02:02:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPOGE1cjdtazZNNUhtVjU0cFc4RDNGMmFZTFJOSEtUYmFReElHUGhjSmctemNRd3E5MzhON1lwSmJ5MGxIakVtazZxSFZnTlRMM1A0cXQ1eDlKbVUyb2ZyY0NXX2VUYXVQaDBWSHJ1THFHd2hVVlN5V1ItWFFnU0RiZE84MHhuYmo1ZnJkeTRhdEpNWndnV2FCQUpvb1c</guid></item><item><title>专家说，昂贵的阿尔茨海默氏症生活方式计划带来了虚假的希望-西雅图时报 | An expensive Alzheimer’s lifestyle plan offers false hope, experts say - The Seattle Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxPbU0ycXowZWpWNEQxZ3d1d2k0LVJFX0lqU2tXZmxRallObTVsWGpFeC1NcHoxaDhvYXpXWkVPUnNRcVYtVVdNZmE4OFlacUdkMlo0OS1pUTkzMG9LN0hqaDd2V2FnT2hDV1ZpM3c2bUdZNm9YTTlzWVNIb0dhVzcxZVdVUklJdDhiamhmMVo1T0dJcmZreXRaUWxIZ19PeWI4WU5FVjVhN2RLRTE2UktfSw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxPbU0ycXowZWpWNEQxZ3d1d2k0LVJFX0lqU2tXZmxRallObTVsWGpFeC1NcHoxaDhvYXpXWkVPUnNRcVYtVVdNZmE4OFlacUdkMlo0OS1pUTkzMG9LN0hqaDd2V2FnT2hDV1ZpM3c2bUdZNm9YTTlzWVNIb0dhVzcxZVdVUklJdDhiamhmMVo1T0dJcmZreXRaUWxIZ19PeWI4WU5FVjVhN2RLRTE2UktfSw?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;An expensive Alzheimer’s lifestyle plan offers false hope, experts say&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 01:53:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxPbU0ycXowZWpWNEQxZ3d1d2k0LVJFX0lqU2tXZmxRallObTVsWGpFeC1NcHoxaDhvYXpXWkVPUnNRcVYtVVdNZmE4OFlacUdkMlo0OS1pUTkzMG9LN0hqaDd2V2FnT2hDV1ZpM3c2bUdZNm9YTTlzWVNIb0dhVzcxZVdVUklJdDhiamhmMVo1T0dJcmZreXRaUWxIZ19PeWI4WU5FVjVhN2RLRTE2UktfSw</guid></item><item><title>感冒疮真的与阿尔茨海默病有关吗？以下是专家们的意见- IFLScience | Are Cold Sores Really Linked To Alzheimer’s Disease?

Most people will be exposed to HSV-1 in their lives and lots of people get &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/are-cold-sores-genetic-72344" target="_blank"&gt;cold sores&lt;/a&gt;, so this conclusion might sound alarming, but it’s important to understand what the paper is actually saying – and what it isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the study about and what did it show?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newly published paper comes from an international team of researchers working at Gilead Sciences Inc., a US pharmaceutical company developing drugs for a number of different diseases, including HSV-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study had a retrospective case-control design. Patients with a diagnosis of &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/tags/alzheimer-s-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; or Alzheimer’s disease-related dementia (ADRD) were matched with a control participant of the same age and sex, living in the same region, and with a similar health history except for one key difference: the controls had no history of neurological disorders. In total, 344,628 pairs were included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the people with Alzheimer’s or ADRD, it was found that 0.44 percent of them had been diagnosed with HSV-1. In the control group, it was 0.25 percent. These are both tiny fractions of the overall number of people, but the difference between these two figures was found to be significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for other health conditions that could play a role, the team concluded that those with Alzheimer’s disease/ADRD were 80 percent more likely to have been diagnosed with HSV-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another finding was that those who had used an antiviral medication to treat their HSV-1 seemed to be somewhat protected and were 17 percent less likely to develop Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the topline findings focused on HSV-1, the team also looked at two similar viruses: HSV-2, the more common cause of genital &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/antiviral-chewing-gum-made-of-beans-could-help-stop-spread-of-herpes-and-flu-78716" target="_blank"&gt;herpes&lt;/a&gt;; and varicella zoster virus (VZV), the virus responsible for chickenpox and shingles. Both of these were also associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can be concluded from this study?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of study can only show that two factors are linked in some way; it cannot show that one &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/if-correlation-does-not-mean-causation-how-do-scientists-prove-stuff-78590" target="_blank"&gt;causes&lt;/a&gt; the other. There are also limitations to the study – as with every research project – that must be accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Despite the large sample size, this research has limitations partly due to only using health records and administrative claims data,” said Dr Sheona Scales, Director of Research at Alzheimer’s Research UK, in a statement to the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencemediacentre.org/expert-reaction-to-study-of-the-cold-sore-virus-herpes-simplex-1-and-risk-of-alzheimers/" target="_blank"&gt;Science Media Centre&lt;/a&gt;. “Most people infected with HSV-1 don’t have any symptoms so some infections might not have been recorded. Infections predating the information recorded are also not available.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other scientists have been more critical. Dr David Vickers, of the Cumming School of Medicine at the University of Calgary, commented, “This pharma-funded research exaggerates the role of HSV-1, failing to appreciate its absence in 99.56 percent of [Alzheimer’s disease] cases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study’s data source makes its findings ungeneralisable, and it overstates a minor infection as a ‘public health priority’ to justify unnecessary treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a number of others, including Professor Tara Spires-Jones of the University of Edinburgh and Professor Cornelia van Duijn of the University of Oxford, praised the study for its careful methodological design, whilst acknowledging that this can’t be the end of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“More research is needed to understand the best way to protect our brains from Alzheimer’s disease as we age,” said Spires-Jones, adding that “it is important to note that HSV-1 infection, which is &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/pretty-much-everybody-s-got-herpes-31677" target="_blank"&gt;extremely common&lt;/a&gt; in the population, is by no means a guarantee that someone will develop Alzheimer’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;HSV-1 and Alzheimer's: What evidence do we already have?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is part of a much broader conversation and a growing body of evidence suggesting that HSV-1 and similar viruses can have a direct impact on the brain, which may include Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/how-the-cold-sore-virus-that-you-probably-have-silently-invades-the-human-brain-76636" target="_blank"&gt;2024 paper&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of Virology used a mouse model to show that HSV-1 can enter the brain via both the brainstem and olfactory nerve, triggering an inflammatory response that can persist when the virus is no longer detectable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/rampant-herpes-virus-could-reach-the-brain-via-the-nose-sparking-behavior-changes-78448" target="_blank"&gt;Earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, a team at the University of Illinois Chicago led a study that found HSV-1 particles can be shed in tears and can reach the nasal cavity that way, moving directly into the brain and potentially contributing to neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/6/679" target="_blank"&gt;2021 paper&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Vaccines even went as far as to argue that the evidence for a “major role” for HSV-1 in Alzheimer’s disease was “overwhelming”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re not saying viruses explain everything. But they may be central to it. This is no longer a fringe theory – it’s the next phase of Alzheimer’s research, and we’re pursuing it,” said Dr Bryce Vissel, Director of the Centre for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine at St Vincent’s Hospital Sydney, in a comment to the &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/cold-sores-implicated-in-the-development-of-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank"&gt;Australian Science Media Centre&lt;/a&gt;. Vissel’s research group are also actively conducting studies in this area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though most of the experts agree that more research is needed to better understand what’s going on, some have pointed to the fact that this study seems to suggest that treating HSV-1 with antiviral medications could help combat the potential damage to the brain. They say doing more to treat and detect these infections, even while the research continues, may not be a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With many GPs and the population being unaware of the dementia related benefits of treating HSV infections and preventing VZV activation through vaccination, it is time to call for actions informing those working in primary care as well as the population at large,” said van Duijn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you were &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/antivaxxing-hot-spot-sees-largest-chickenpox-outbreak-in-decades-50626" target="_blank"&gt;vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;, chances are you were exposed to VZV as a kid; there are now vaccines available that prevent the virus reactivating later in life as &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;shingles&lt;/a&gt;, and you can ask a healthcare professional about availability where you are. As for HSV-1 and 2, many people may be infected without ever having any symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you are worried about a cold sore or your general health, be sure to seek the appropriate help from a health professional,” recommends Dr Richard Oakley, Director of Research and Innovation at Alzheimer’s Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/15/5/e093946" target="_blank"&gt;BMJ Open&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 May 2025 00:55:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQYkY2LWJGVmdrT3FFWGhqUVYwN2tkRUZ0NWhhQXFZQzBacDhvRDNCWkNON2VGWVlmY3Y3dWZDMEkwYlFqeVNrRTZiNmZ3bXoxb2JrZ3h5YTRlRW5iUlRQd0RiZUEzSDVQcFlNb2RNWVRiUjM3SFE3VlYyRkxmeW1tcUdNTmhBV1BaUHVZRDh6TWNVVk1NY20xSS1UUTVzZGw0Wld2anZDTXFZdzBzOUdTQVl3Z0sycFMw</guid></item><item><title>认知训练可以减少抑郁症和创伤后应激障碍患者的负面自我认知- PsyPost | Cognitive training may reduce negative self-perceptions in people with depression and PTSD - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitgFBVV95cUxQazBqSmVDczI0TGFBTnlyT3dBc1poMHktaFZQUl9uTk4tdDZXQkp1X2dMYjctMnhoUEVLSVdTM0pNbnZjaTZYdXBoV0doZHFDeERxNi14TTVnSjNfM0FTZ3F5MVBEVWZIaHNvTXFEa0dILXpsc3RwODdGbUIxSjdyTDdfTG8yek1Pc3FlU2FmeUtLeVZSaXJzVElXWUFEUHBPZ3I2NXpjdTdLQ2JFdlF5c2Rnb19VUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with depression and posttraumatic stress disorder tend to underestimate their cognitive abilities—a pattern that may worsen their mental health. A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2025-18950-001" target="_blank"&gt;Neuropsychology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; provides evidence that this negative self-perception, known as metacognitive bias, is both common and severe in individuals with high levels of depressive and PTSD symptoms. The researchers also found that targeted or game-based cognitive training can improve these biases and may contribute to a reduction in symptom severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression and PTSD are two of the most common mental health conditions, often marked by persistent negative thoughts and emotional distress. Depression is characterized by symptoms such as sadness, low energy, and loss of interest in daily activities, while PTSD can involve intrusive memories, avoidance of reminders, emotional numbness, and heightened arousal following exposure to traumatic events. Both conditions are known to distort how individuals perceive themselves and the world around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, researchers have become increasingly interested in how metacognition—the ability to reflect on and evaluate one’s own thoughts and abilities—may influence mental health. One important aspect of metacognition is “metacognitive bias,” or the tendency to systematically overestimate or underestimate one’s own abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While people in the general population often show a slight tendency to overestimate themselves, this study focused on the opposite problem: large-scale underestimation among individuals with depression and PTSD. The researchers wanted to examine how strongly these negative self-perceptions were related to symptoms and whether cognitive training could help reduce them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore these questions, researchers reanalyzed data from a randomized controlled trial known as the BRAVE study, which involved 84 participants, mostly military veterans, who had experienced mild traumatic brain injuries and reported cognitive difficulties. About three-quarters of the participants had either elevated depression, PTSD symptoms, or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants were randomly assigned to one of two 13-week training programs: a “targeted cognitive training” group that completed computerized exercises designed to improve attention, memory, and executive function, or an “entertainment training” group that played puzzle and board games like Tetris and Solitaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before and after the training, participants completed a variety of assessments. Self-reported cognitive performance was measured using the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire, a validated 25-item scale that captures daily lapses in attention and memory. Objective cognitive performance was evaluated using a battery of tests measuring learning, memory, working memory, attention, and cognitive flexibility. By comparing self-perceived and actual performance, researchers calculated each participant’s metacognitive bias. Depression and PTSD symptoms were also measured using well-established clinical questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the start of the study, the researchers found that people with elevated depression or PTSD symptoms significantly underestimated their cognitive abilities compared to their actual test scores. On average, participants with both conditions scored nearly 2.3 standard deviations below the norm in their self-assessments, despite relatively mild objective impairments. This discrepancy—referred to as a negative global metacognitive bias—was strongly linked to the severity of depression and PTSD symptoms. The researchers found no evidence that these negative biases were linked to specific types of cognitive impairment, suggesting that they reflect a broader pattern of self-doubt rather than performance in a particular area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the 13-week intervention period, participants in both the targeted and entertainment training groups showed notable improvements. Those who completed either program reported fewer cognitive problems, reduced depression symptoms, and improved metacognitive accuracy. Importantly, the size of the improvement in metacognitive bias was correlated with the reduction in both depression and PTSD symptoms. This relationship was especially strong in the entertainment training group, where participants who most improved their self-perception also experienced the greatest mental health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, while both training programs improved self-reported cognition and metacognitive bias, only the targeted training group showed small, non-significant trends toward better objective cognitive performance. This suggests that the subjective feeling of improved cognitive ability—rather than actual test performance—may play a more important role in symptom improvement for people with depression and PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe the performance feedback embedded in both training programs may be key to these improvements. In both training conditions, participants received feedback on their progress and were rewarded for correct performance, helping them to form more accurate beliefs about their cognitive abilities. This positive reinforcement may have helped counteract the negative thinking patterns common in depression and PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three months after training ended, participants continued to report lower depression symptoms, and those in the entertainment group also maintained improvements in PTSD symptoms and metacognitive bias. These lasting effects suggest that cognitive training—especially when designed to be engaging and motivating—may have durable benefits for people struggling with self-doubt and negative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study offers promising evidence, the authors note several limitations. The sample consisted primarily of military veterans with a history of mild traumatic brain injury, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other groups. Additionally, the study did not include a no-treatment control group, making it difficult to rule out the influence of nonspecific effects such as time, attention, or participant expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies with larger, more diverse samples and more rigorous control conditions will be needed to confirm whether improvements in metacognitive bias can directly lead to reductions in depression and PTSD symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/neu0000967" target="_blank"&gt;Negative Global Metacognitive Biases Are Associated With Depressive and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms and Improve With Targeted or Game-Based Cognitive Training&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Sam Agnoli, Henry Mahncke, Sarah-Jane Grant, Zachary T.

                                &lt;div class="hsa-paywall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hawaii Department of Health said cases of pertussis are on the rise in the state, and is urging residents to keep up with recommended vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH said, as of May 15, there have been 108 cases of pertussis reported, compared to 84 cases for all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pertussis is a highly contagious respiratory disease spread through the air via the coughs or sneezes of an infected person,” said DOH in a news release. “Initially, the symptoms resemble a cold but can progress to intense coughing fits. In children, coughing fits can be followed by a deep breath that makes a whooping sound.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health complications from pertussis can be serious and even life-threatening, DOH said, especially for infants and young children who are not fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some potential complications include pneumonia, seizures, apnea (a pause in breathing), encephalopathy (a disease of the brain) and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most effective way to prevent pertussis is through vaccination with either the DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis) or Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis) vaccines,” said DOH. “Multiple doses are recommended for infants, children and adults.”&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, DOH said no further cases of measles have been reported in the state following the two confirmed in early April — one in a &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/04/08/breaking-news/hawaii-confirms-travel-related-measles-case-in-child-under-5/" target="_self" rel="noopener"&gt;child under age 5 &lt;/a&gt;and the other in an adult household member — related to international travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH has concluded there was no further community spread from those two cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials are concerned, however, of the growing number of cases on the mainland, which has now surpassed 1,000 across 30 states this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“DOH recommends continued vigilance and efforts to increase the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccination rate,” said the department. “High vaccination rates protect individuals and communities and prevent cases from becoming outbreaks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates for all routinely recommended vaccinations for school entry, including those for measles, pertussis, polio and chickenpox, have declined in Hawaii and nationally since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOH strongly recommends that children and adults stay up-to-date with recommended vaccinations to prevent vaccine-preventable diseases. It also encourages residents to discuss concerns about vaccines with a trusted health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study linked high-quality carbohydrate intake in midlife to healthier aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High-quality carbs include those from whole grains, fruits, non-starchy vegetables and legumes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those carbs were associated with better physical function and cognitive health decades later.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What you eat in your 40s and 50s might help determine how well you age decades later. According to a new study published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/em&gt;, women who consumed more &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938733/healthiest-carbs-you-should-be-buying-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-quality carbohydrates and fiber&lt;/a&gt; in midlife were significantly more likely to reach older adulthood with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/polyphenols-reduce-cognitive-decline-11680121" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;good physical and cognitive function&lt;/a&gt;—and without major chronic illnesses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study supports what nutrition experts have long suspected: it’s not just about how many carbohydrates you eat, but which ones you choose. Carbs from &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7878282/complete-plant-based-diet-grocery-list/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whole plant foods&lt;/a&gt; like fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains were linked to a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-diet-to-reach-70-study-11703981" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;higher likelihood of healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, diets high in refined &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8047875/what-are-refined-carbs/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt; (think: cookies, white-flour pasta) had the opposite effect.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re looking for simple, sustainable ways to support your future health, this research makes a strong case for upgrading the quality of your carbs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers from Tufts University and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health conducted a prospective cohort study—a study that follows a group of people over time—using data from the well-known Nurses’ Health Study. This long-running study has followed more than 100,000 female nurses since 1976, collecting detailed information about their diets, lifestyles and health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For this analysis, the researchers focused on more than 47,000 women who were under the age of 60 in 1984. Participants completed comprehensive food frequency questionnaires in 1984 and 1986, and researchers tracked their diets and health outcomes over the next 30-plus years. By 2016, the women were between ages 70 and 93.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just under 8% of the women qualified as healthy agers. To define “healthy aging,” the researchers looked for women who met all of the following criteria: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;They were free from 11 major chronic diseases (including cancer, heart disease, and diabetes).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They had no significant memory or physical impairments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They reported good mental health. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers then analyzed the associations between different types of carbohydrate intake in midlife and the odds of meeting that definition of healthy aging decades later.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The biggest takeaway was simple: quality counts when it comes to carbs and aging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Women who ate more high-quality carbohydrates—specifically those found in whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes—had significantly greater odds of aging in good health. Every 10% increase in calories from these types of carbs was associated with a higher likelihood of healthy aging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating more &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287742/10-amazing-health-benefits-of-eating-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fiber-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; was also linked to better outcomes. The analysis found that consuming high-quality carbohydrates from whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes, as well as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-changes-that-helped-me-eat-more-fiber-11734788" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;higher total dietary fiber&lt;/a&gt; during midlife, was associated with a 6% to 37% higher chance of healthy aging and improvements in various aspects of mental and physical health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Meanwhile, diets high in refined carbohydrates—those from added sugars, white bread, and other processed grains—were linked to worse outcomes. Women who ate more refined carbs had a 13% lower likelihood of aging well. Starchy vegetables like potatoes and corn were also associated with poorer aging markers, particularly when consumed in large amounts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The researchers also examined &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/low-glycemic-diet-vs-low-carb-diet-which-is-healthier-8559250" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL)&lt;/a&gt;, which reflect how much and how quickly a carbohydrate-rich food raises blood sugar. A higher GI and a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/carbs-with-more-fiber-than-brown-rice-8710406" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;higher carbohydrate-to-fiber ratio&lt;/a&gt; were both associated with significantly lower odds of healthy aging. Interestingly, GL was positively associated with healthy aging, but that association weakened when fiber intake was factored in—suggesting that fiber-rich foods were driving the benefit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Finally, the researchers looked at what would happen if certain macronutrients were replaced with high-quality carbs. Replacing refined carbohydrates, fat or animal protein with high-quality carbs resulted in a 7% to 16% increase in the odds of healthy aging.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The good news is that the “high-quality carbs” linked to healthy aging are easy to find in your local grocery store—and likely already part of your diet. And if you want to add more of them to your noshing routine, we have some recipes and recommendations to help you on that front.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can start by choosing &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8031247/healthy-whole-grains-to-eat-more-fiber/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt; more often. Opt for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/grain-bowl-recipes-to-make-forever-8604226" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;brown rice, quinoa, oats, bulgur or farro&lt;/a&gt; instead of white rice or refined pasta. Recipes like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/280144/farro-salad-with-grilled-chicken/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Farro Salad with Grilled Chicken&lt;/a&gt; or brown rice-packed &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7934153/chicken-spinach-rice-casserole-with-sun-dried-tomato-cream-sauce/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Chicken, Spinach and Rice Casserole&lt;/a&gt; make whole grains as tasty as they are nutritious.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We also know that piling on the produce is a great choice for healthy carbs. Try adding an extra serving of vegetables or fruit to each meal. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/274447/fresh-vs-canned-vs-frozen-which-is-better/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Frozen and canned options&lt;/a&gt; (without added sugar or salt) are great, affordable choices. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8061834/healthiest-beans-to-eat/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Adding legumes&lt;/a&gt; to your routine can help, too. &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/eat-more-beans-with-these-recipes-11709540" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Beans, lentils and chickpeas&lt;/a&gt; are budget-friendly, fiber-packed sources of plant-based carbs and protein. They’re the stars of delicious bites like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/marry-me-lentils-11720903" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;Marry Me Lentils&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/chickpea-sweet-potato-grain-bowls-8703855" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;Chickpea &amp;amp; Sweet Potato Grain Bowls&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And making some snacking changes could help you out, too—especially if you tend to opt for more processed, refined snacks. Try switching processed favorites like crackers and chips for options like &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/brain-healthy-high-fiber-snack-recipes-8639130" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;fresh fruit, roasted chickpeas or whole grain toast&lt;/a&gt; with nut butter. These small changes can build up over time, potentially helping to preserve your mental clarity, physical strength and overall well-being well into your later years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Network Open &lt;/em&gt;suggests that women who eat more high-quality carbs in midlife may experience better health as they age. Women who ate more fiber-rich foods and carbs from fruits, veggies and whole grains in midlife had better odds of staying healthy, active and sharp as they got older. This study adds to growing evidence that not all carbs are created equal—especially when it comes to aging well. Choosing more whole, plant-based carbs over refined ones could be a simple yet powerful strategy to support healthy aging.

Coating bed nets in the drug cocktail is the long-term aim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Sleeping under a bed net has been one of the most successful ways of preventing malaria as the main malaria-spreading mosquitoes hunt at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Vaccines to protect children living in high-risk malaria areas are also recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Nets are both a physical barrier and also contain insecticides which kill mosquitoes that land on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But mosquitoes have become resistant to insecticide in many countries so the chemicals no longer kill the insects as effectively as they used to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We haven't really tried to directly kill parasites in the mosquito before this, because we were just killing the mosquito," says researcher Dr Alexandra Probst, from Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, she says that approach is "no longer cutting it".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The researchers analysed malaria's DNA to find possible weak spots while it is infecting mosquitoes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They took a large library of potential drugs and narrowed it down to a shortlist of 22. These were tested when female mosquitoes were given a blood-meal contaminated with malaria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09039-2" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;In their article in Nature&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists describe two highly effective drugs that killed 100% of the parasites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The drugs were tested on material similar to bed nets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Even if that mosquito survives contact with the bed net, the parasites within are killed and so it's still not transmitting malaria," said Dr Probst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I think this is a really exciting approach, because it's a totally new way of targeting mosquitoes themselves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She says the malaria parasite is less likely to become resistant to the drugs as there are billions of them in each infected person, but less than five in each mosquito. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The effect of the drugs lasts for a year on the nets, potentially making it a cheap and long-lasting alternative to insecticide, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This approach has been proven in the laboratory. The next stage is already planned in Ethiopia to see if the anti-malarial bed nets are effective in the real world.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It will take at least six years before all the studies are completed to know if this approach will work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But the vision is to have bed nets treated with both anti-malaria drugs and insecticide so that if one approach doesn't work, then the other will. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 23:10:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE8ya2U1TUJKeHFRYUI1dEdjdThLY05lU045dDRZOHU5RjlGR1dIWGxpTVNMV1Y2elNMN0J0Ukp5ejdCWUNHU1htN0tpYlZGRmNyTVdiUVE3SEZTd9IBX0FVX3lxTE5vOXY1R1VzeHBzYXhrLXlSdHB5WTdFdGI0b2VJazFmM0xsUlN0c1ZKT0J5VVdMYUxXaGhzT1pITm9oaTRSQkhZQVNUOHFZUDJLMHI1RDZrSDhGQlNEekpF</guid></item><item><title>呼吁NHS为乳房密集的女性提供额外的癌症扫描- BBC | Call for NHS to give women with dense breasts extra cancer scans - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9ma3BheDJhRzBTZ1NxTmZIRklCRDZia0pKTlFMU2tId3piWVdLQThlU0ZoNDVfdEQ2RUo1bVRDcjdTeUxsSmE3WE01VVpIWHdSVTRkaVhrZHlxZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE92M1BzbTlhQkJCc0dDWTg0WEFYeUZsc1NKbHdyNTgweVhvQ0lXZDFVZmswSURKX2VFd3pGOTA2OUFETzdUZnZtandfcFI1YXFIeW9ZdVRwYVBhZ2Qtb3Jv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;Call for NHS to give women with dense breasts extra cancer scans&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 kVRMhO"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250508-105310-2a3fc0651-web-2.21.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/5c4b/live/8fb5b0c0-3653-11f0-8555-1116719b8bf6.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/5c4b/live/8fb5b0c0-3653-11f0-8555-1116719b8bf6.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5c4b/live/8fb5b0c0-3653-11f0-8555-1116719b8bf6.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/5c4b/live/8fb5b0c0-3653-11f0-8555-1116719b8bf6.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/5c4b/live/8fb5b0c0-3653-11f0-8555-1116719b8bf6.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/5c4b/live/8fb5b0c0-3653-11f0-8555-1116719b8bf6.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/5c4b/live/8fb5b0c0-3653-11f0-8555-1116719b8bf6.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/5c4b/live/8fb5b0c0-3653-11f0-8555-1116719b8bf6.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Getty Images A woman goes for a mammogram.

One of these processes is maintaining a healthy pH, which is the balance between acid and base. The pH scale runs from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral—anything below 7 is acidic, and anything above it is basic or alkaline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For example, stomach (hydrochloric) acid needs to be very acidic for proper digestion. It ranks at about a 1, just above battery acid, but your blood pH should be at a neutral 7. And our bodies have amazing built-in mechanisms for regulating and maintaining blood pH. For example, if your body senses excessive levels of acid, your lungs and kidneys go to work to remedy the situation by expelling carbon dioxide through breathing and urinating. Or the pancreas will secrete bicarbonate, a compound that helps buffer acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the body is designed to adjust to its environment to bring it back to center, there are some questions as to whether too much of certain foods might play a role in creating a more acidic environment, especially in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. This then lends to questioning whether a more acidic GI tract increases the risk of GI cancers, including liver, colorectal, gastric (stomach), pancreatic and esophageal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers in Korea observed that there is some evidence that people who eat a Western-style diet—one high in fat and sugar—create a more acidic environment in their bodies that is favorable for malignant cell growth. They took a closer look at this theory and recently published their findings in the &lt;em&gt;European Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s break them down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Best Foods to Eat for Gut Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Best Foods to Eat for Gut Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How Was This Study Conducted?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Data was drawn from a long-term Korean study called the Cancer Screenee Cohort, which began in 2002. Almost 11,000 participants were used for this current study, about 64% of them female, with an average age at baseline of 53. Participants were followed on average for eight years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Participants had completed food frequency questionnaires, from which researchers calculated “dietary acid loads” using three different methods. Researchers determined the number of GI cancer cases using the 2020 Korea National Cancer Incidence Database, which records most instances of cancer in the country. In addition, they checked electronic medical records to catch any cases that might not have been recorded in the cancer incidence database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Demographic information that would be adjusted for during statistical analyses included BMI (which was measured by trained staff), physical activity levels, education level, occupation, marital status, first-degree family history of cancer, smoking status and alcohol intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What Did This Study Find?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Overall, researchers found that individuals who were diagnosed with GI cancer tended to have a more acidogenic diet than those without GI cancer. And as the dietary acid load score increased, so did the risk of GI cancer. This association was much stronger in males compared to females. For this study, researchers note red and processed meats as being the primary acidic foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers aren’t sure why male participants had a higher risk of GI cancers than female participants, even when dietary acid load scores were similar, but offer a few possible explanations. First, they state that females tend to have better kidney function than males, thereby giving females a greater capacity for acid-base balance maintenance. They also state that there could be sex hormones involved, since estrogen tends to have a protective effect at the cellular level—which then raises the question for post-menopausal women. Lastly, in this analysis, the males tended to have higher acidic diets, including higher alcohol intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s important to note a few limitations of this study. First, this study cannot determine causation. In other words, it cannot conclude that more acidic foods, which include red and processed meats, cause GI cancer. It can only suggest a strong association between the two. There may be other factors at work, as well, such as genetics or smoking and high alcohol intake, though these were adjusted for in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers also note that they could not take supplement use into consideration as a confounder since there wasn’t enough information on that (certain supplements may raise or lower acid load). Finally, they note that the study population was relatively small, which may have reduced the statistical power of the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/search?q=red+meat" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:https://www.eatingwell.com/search?q=red+meat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;https://www.eatingwell.com/search?q=red+meat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How Does This Apply to Real Life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;You’ve probably seen ads for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7961286/what-is-alkaline-water-and-is-it-healthy-heres-what-dietitians-have-to-say/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:alkaline water;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;alkaline water&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to companies jumping on the idea that we can control the acid-base balance in our bodies. And though this study would certainly lean that direction, there is still so much we don’t yet know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While our bodies are designed to constantly work to maintain internal stability, is it possible that they can go into acid overload from certain foods that end up hijacking the body’s biological systems? There is evidence that suggests yes, but don’t go investing in expensive bottled water just yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These researchers suggest a simpler swap—red and processed meats for fruits and veggies, which tend to be more alkaline. Exceptions include citrus fruits and tomatoes, which rank from 2 and 4 on the pH scale. But this doesn’t mean you shouldn’t eat them. Citrus fruits and tomatoes offer loads of nutrition and health benefits, including immune support and antioxidants that calm inflammation. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/fruits-to-lower-colon-cancer-risk-11716524" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Citrus fruits;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Citrus fruits&lt;/a&gt; are even connected with a lower rate of colon cancer—which raises the question about whether it’s really the acid load or something else about red and processed meats that might increase the GI cancer risk, since citrus fruits are more acidic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The key is to eat a variety of foods, including different types of plants—fruits, veggies, nuts, seeds, whole grains and legumes. This ensures you not only get the nutrients your body needs, but it also spreads out the pH levels among the plants you’re eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Do a quick assessment of your eating pattern. Are you including a lot of red and processed meats? How about foods and beverages with high levels of added sugar? Where can you start rotating in more plants?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Eating habits, like other habits, are pathways in our brains. These pathways were forged somewhere in your past and became automatic. To start new habits, you need to make purposeful, intentional choices because otherwise, your brain will automatically choose the path of least resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sleep-and-longevity-8430567" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The #1 Habit You Should Start to Live Longer, According to Health Experts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The #1 Habit You Should Start to Live Longer, According to Health Experts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Habit change tends to be easier for people if they start small. Choose an area you’re likely to have success with, so that you can build on that success over time. For example, could you exchange one of your daily sodas or energy drinks for a flavored sparkling water (so you’re still getting the bubbles)? If you typically have that beverage for a mid-afternoon energy boost, could you instead have an energizing snack—like a handful of nuts and a piece of fruit—to accomplish the same thing? Or sometimes we just need to change our physiology for an energy boost, in which case, taking a quick break from your desk and walking a lap or two around your house or office space might do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;These researchers also mention the Mediterranean diet as an eating pattern characterized by high fruit and vegetable intake and low or moderate meat intake. Because of this, the Mediterranean diet is associated with high levels of adiponectin, a compound known for its protective role against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;If you’re ready to dive in and work on changing your overall eating pattern, we’ve got plenty of Mediterranean diet meal plans and recipes to choose from.

&lt;p class="block"&gt;According to the Sachem School District, 116 students and seven staff members were identified as having had prolonged contact with the infected student, and were offered tests on Monday at the school’s East Campus. Individuals who were tested received TB skin testing administered by the Suffolk County Health Department. Results from those tests typically take 48 hours to process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;So far, there have been no additional cases confirmed within the school community, but the investigation is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Concerned parents are demanding more information and greater transparency from school and health officials. “What’s being done to ensure the safety of the kids when we, as parents or guardians, send them to school?” asked Janie Gallo, a Farmingville resident and parent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Tuberculosis is a potentially serious bacterial infection that typically affects the lungs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says TB spreads through the air when a person with active TB disease coughs, sneezes or talks. Symptoms may include a persistent cough, chest pain, fatigue and fever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;As of now, the New York State Department of Health reports there have been 16 confirmed TB cases in Suffolk County and 18 in neighboring Nassau County this year — numbers that are consistent with last year’s data for the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Health officials say those initially tested this week will need to undergo another round of testing in July, once the standard two-month TB incubation period has passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News 12 - Long Island</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 22:07:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxOQ0VwbXBmQ0RXMC1kdUQ2TG91RzhSZk1XLU95REticnd1ZFc1ZThBNGlVSEN1RDFFNHRQOTdtYU1nOG96aXBzUXRoVEFlYzVjWEVHa2tUc3hnSHB2cGxWZDVZWU9lTHJjMExZcVZLTnpJVDZkRDlITGxfSl9FbWpmMmNrTFUwcFRCZkZUbkd0YjVOdkdLNE1JYzBPQlhzLWVlS1Y5Wm5nQWVoMDFsdGxlWnIxVkhtVVhfcThzbnM1eUFWMU0</guid></item><item><title>美国医学存在信任问题- BBC | American medicine has a trust problem - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOckdPU1cyRG1sWG93SXVrYnBmRG4tRUNqUWR2QlE5cmducUEzTDFtM0xTcktMa3BBblJDX21oZnc5NVVJZS1LOFdVei1PUUJuaFJwTC00S09vUUFMekFwYkp2Z0dEd2VpZDFJMENJSWUzUUZrY3BlbWN1MXpHMmUtQUZJc0t0R2pYOXR1UWJaSGVmelA5R3BaYjFNZ3dRcjE2MTFxSHhtMWx0dw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;American medicine has a trust problem&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 kVRMhO"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250508-105310-2a3fc0651-web-2.21.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lchghr.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC BBC Special Correspondent Katty Kay is shown speaking to Dr Leana Wen via video call.

There's the anti-vaccine community, who often distrust both America's health agencies and the big pharmaceutical companies. There are also the people who previously trusted health agencies, but are now sceptical of US President Donald Trump’s administration and are particularly wary of Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F Kennedy Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;What does it mean for health outcomes when so many people don't believe in the doctors, drug companies and the public agencies who are there to treat us?

We are already seeing the single &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c984vjl0gp2o" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;largest measles outbreak in the US&lt;/a&gt; in the last 30 years. Measles has &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;been eliminated&lt;/a&gt; since 2000, but the US could lose its measles elimination status. We are seeing rising cases of things like whooping cough. If vaccination rates for other diseases fall, we could also see a return of rubella and &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240229-why-dont-some-countries-vaccinate-against-chickenpox" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;chickenpox&lt;/a&gt; and even polio – things that would really have been unthinkable just several years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But if you have such distrust over vaccines, that also means that there's a distrust of authority, of science, of the scientific method, of what counts as science and how one does research. And that could have negative impacts on many other aspects of health, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="kk:" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;KK: &lt;/b&gt;Are there things that work for pulling people back into a position where they might have mistrusted medical authorities, but they can then say, 'OK, yes, I can trust authority. I can trust what science is telling me?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="lw:" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;LW: &lt;/b&gt;The core aspect of being a physician is the one-on-one conversation with our patients, and it's in those one-on-one conversations that we see a lot of change, because we never approach these conversations with the assumption that 'I'm right and you're wrong' or that you must have listened to all these &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200522-what-we-can-learn-from-conspiracy-theories" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt;. We come to those conversations asking people what their thoughts are, what they have heard, why they believe one thing or another – and then we meet them where they are in those conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Often, that means that we have to overlook their opposition to vaccines, because we don't want to push them away so much. Then, they're now not willing to get treatment for their high blood pressure and diabetes, and then may go out and have a stroke. So, I think part of building that trust actually is knowing when to make the case and when not to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;It's not an option to get frustrated – Leana Wen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="kk:" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;KK: &lt;/b&gt;If you were talking to parents of a young child who didn't want to get their child vaccinated against measles, [who are] afraid of measles vaccine and what it might do to their child, what would you say to them, doctor?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="lw:" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;LW: &lt;/b&gt;I think I would start by asking them some more questions about what it is that they are afraid of. Are they afraid of all vaccines, or are they just afraid of this one? What exactly is the concern?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;On the other hand, if what they're concerned about is all vaccines, because they don't believe that measles is that serious, then I would point to the reality about measles: that yes, it's true that most people who get measles will have a mild case of it, but &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/index.html" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;one in five will have pneumonia&lt;/a&gt;. One in 20 will end up being hospitalised. One to three out of a thousand children with measles &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nfid.org/resource/frequently-asked-questions-about-measles/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;will die&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So, I think it really depends on what those specific concerns are. But ultimately, the message is very straightforward: Vaccines are safe. They're effective. They're life-saving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="kk:" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;KK: &lt;/b&gt;Do you think, in the environment we're living in, that it is sometimes impossible to persuade people because it's almost tribal? As somebody who is a scientist and a doctor, how personally frustrating is that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="lw:" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;LW: &lt;/b&gt;I think back to what the individual conversations with patients will look like, because it's not an option to get frustrated. And you could say, 'OK, we're not going to touch this subject for the time being, because we're not going to make headway'. And again, I don't want to drive you, the patient, away from all the other recommendations that are important for your health. If you don't see me as the doctor, maybe you'll go to somebody else who will take offense to what you're saying about vaccines and then you won't get any medical treatment. That's not a good outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;I think it is reasonable to put aside certain differences and maybe try to approach it later and focus on areas of common ground. But I think that most of all, it's really important to not approach the individual who you don't agree with with scorn or scepticism or anger, because that's only going to elicit a defensive reaction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="kk:" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;KK:&lt;/b&gt; In April, after two small children &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;died of measles&lt;/a&gt;, Health [and Human Services] Secretary Robert F Kennedy &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99n18zlzg3o" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;endorsed the MMR vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, which prevents measles. He then got attacked online from people who are in the anti-vax camp who were very disappointed that he had come out and endorsed the vaccine. A day later, he posted a photograph of himself with a couple of doctors who are opposed to vaccines, to the MMR vaccines. And he called them extraordinary healers. And he also promoted some unproven treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So, I'm quite confused about where the health secretary stands on vaccines. And I imagine if my kids were still young and I was at the stage where I was having to look at getting them vaccinated, I, as a parent, might be quite confused, as well. Are you clear about where the health secretary stands, particularly on the measles vaccine, given the outbreak of measles in the country at the moment? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;b id="lw:" class="sc-d16436d-0 jpoiOL"&gt;LW: &lt;/b&gt;Yes, I am very clear on where RFK Jr stands, although I think that your interpretation of it is very fair and also very correct. You are confused because he intends for it to be confusing, because he is trying to speak to two very, very different constituencies who have completely opposing goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;On the one hand, RFK Jr is a well-known vaccine conspiracy theorist who, for dozens of years, founded and ran an &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0mzk2y41zvo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;anti-vaccine organisation&lt;/a&gt;. He's seen as a champion by people who head up the anti-vaccine movements themselves. So, that is a core constituency that got him into this role and he has to placate them. So, he's said many things that are very harmful and untrue. Playing down, for example, the seriousness of the measles infection, talking about treatments that are not treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;To be clear, there is no specific antiviral that will cure measles. So, he talks about steroids and antibiotics and things that are not treatments for measles. In a way, that also plays down the seriousness of the disease – people mistakenly think that there is a treatment that there is not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;At the same time, he continues to spread doubt about the safety and effectiveness of the MMR vaccine. He has said in recent weeks that it causes just as much illness as measles itself. He has continued to promote the debunked allegation that the MMR vaccine is tied to autism. He's &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkx3egk3ygo" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;announced research&lt;/a&gt; to study this conspiracy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So, he's currently walking this line between trying to appease the anti-vaccine camp and trying to appease some people, including moderate Republicans, who are trying to get him to say things like, 'Well, the measles vaccine is a good thing'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So, he's trying to say both of these things and that's why it comes out sounding confused, because that's, in fact, how he intends it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;i id='[in-a-statement-to-the-bbc,-vianca-n.-rodriguez-feliciano,-press-secretary-at-the-us-department-of-health-and-human-services,-said-that-the-department-is-committed-to-building-public-trust-in-science-and,-specifically,-"secretary-kennedy-is-not-anti-vaccine-–-he-is-pro-safety,-pro-transparency,-and-pro-accountability".' class="sc-d16436d-0 fhKUCU"&gt;[In a statement to the BBC, Vianca N.

Telomeres are protective caps on chromosomes that shorten with age and are associated with chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over four years, those who took vitamin D experienced significantly less telomere shortening, equivalent to nearly three years of delayed aging, compared to those who took a placebo. These findings support vitamin D as a promising intervention to reduce age-related cellular decline, though more research is needed to confirm long-term benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anti-Aging Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; Vitamin D3 supplementation slowed telomere shortening over 4 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cellular Protection:&lt;/strong&gt; Participants retained the equivalent of 3 extra years of telomere health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Effect from Omega-3s:&lt;/strong&gt; Omega-3 supplementation did not significantly impact telomere length.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Mass General&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results from the VITAL randomized controlled trial reveal that vitamin D supplementation helps maintain telomeres, protective caps at the ends of chromosomes that shorten during aging and are linked to the development of certain diseases. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new report, which is published in &lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;, is based on data from a VITAL sub-study co-led by researchers at Mass General Brigham and the Medical College of Georgia, and supports a promising role in slowing a pathway for biological aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“VITAL is the first large-scale and long-term randomized trial to show that vitamin D supplements protect telomeres and preserve telomere length,” said co-author JoAnn Manson, MD, principal investigator of VITAL and chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, a founding member of the Mass General Brigham healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is of particular interest because VITAL had also shown benefits of vitamin D in reducing inflammation and lowering risks of selected chronic diseases of aging, such as advanced cancer and autoimmune disease.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telomeres are made of repeating sequences of DNA, or base pairs, that prevent chromosome ends from degrading or fusing with other chromosomes. Telomere shortening is a natural part of aging and is associated with an increased risk of various age-related diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few short-term, small-scale studies have suggested that vitamin D or omega 3 fatty acid supplementation may help support telomeres, but results have been inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VITAL is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D3 (2,000 IU/day) and omega 3 fatty acid (1 g/day) supplementation that tracked U.S. females aged 55 years and older and males aged 50 years and older for five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VITAL Telomere sub-study included 1,054 of these participants, whose telomere length in white blood cells was assessed at baseline and at Year 2 and Year 4.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with taking placebo, taking vitamin D3 supplements significantly reduced telomere shortening over four years, preventing the equivalent of nearly three years of aging compared with placebo. Omega 3 fatty acid supplementation had no significant effect on telomere length throughout follow-up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Our findings suggest that targeted vitamin D supplementation may be a promising strategy to counter a biological aging process, although further research is warranted,” said Haidong Zhu, PhD, first author of the report and a molecular geneticist at the Medical College of Georgia, Augusta University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authorship:&lt;/strong&gt; In addition to Manson, Mass General Brigham authors include Nancy R.

We hypothesized that vitamin D or n-3 FAs supplementation reduce leukocyte telomere length (LTL) attrition overtime by leveraging the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL) trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0020"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;VITAL is a large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a 2 x 2 factorial design of vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (2,000 IU/day) and marine n-3 FAs (1 g/day) supplements for 5 years among a representative sample of 25,871 US females ≥55 and males ≥50 years of age. The VITAL Telomere study (NCT04386577) included 1054 participants who were evaluated in person at the Harvard Clinical and Translational Science Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LTL was determined by the Absolute Human Telomere Length Quantification quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method at baseline, Year 2, and Year 4. The pre-specified primary outcome measures were changes in LTL between baseline, Year 2 and Year 4. Analyses of intervention effect used mixed-effects linear regression models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0025"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;LTL was measured in a total of 2,571 samples from the 1031 participants at baseline, year 2, and year 4. Compared to placebo, vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; supplementation significantly decreased LTL attrition by 0.14 kilo base pairs (kb) (0.01, 0.27) over 4 years (p = 0.039).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall trend analysis showed that the vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; supplementation group had LTLs that were about 0.035 kb higher per year of follow-up compared to placebo group (0.002, 0.07, p=0.037). Marine n-3 FAs supplementation had no significant effect on LTL at either year 2 or year 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0030"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;4-years of supplementation with 2000 IU/day vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; reduced telomere attrition by 140 bp, suggesting that vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; daily supplementation with or without n-3 FAs might have a role in counteracting telomere erosion or cell senescence.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 21:57:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFBCU3lpcUVYLUxNYm5nR0hPUC04aHBISllxNGZqY1dTOWJ0aFZKR0hYRElydzBoUU1HdnlJVXVhZVB6aXZMQ3daQ1BRQnlWQlpLaGpPUWQ5NzFuOGtiOTcyTU9MRWVGSG5GQnhXdEV3</guid></item><item><title>FDA扩大新冠肺炎疫苗接种的心脏风险警告- Axios | FDA expands warnings of heart risks on COVID shots - Axios</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTFBmeEROOXAta2xKVURtaTN4NG1oaUxsNWh1LWt4MXJwSTBLTmR4V3EwdVIzUzBzSVV5R1RFZGtNNWNVbEcwVm9IYzNTMG1HUDV4YWoyRnJ0R0hQMHVnOXNEd2d1b3dodTVzcUNfbg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 21:42:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTFBmeEROOXAta2xKVURtaTN4NG1oaUxsNWh1LWt4MXJwSTBLTmR4V3EwdVIzUzBzSVV5R1RFZGtNNWNVbEcwVm9IYzNTMG1HUDV4YWoyRnJ0R0hQMHVnOXNEd2d1b3dodTVzcUNfbg</guid></item><item><title>与儿童推理技能相关的微小大脑褶皱-神经科学新闻 | Tiny Brain Folds Linked to Reasoning Skills in Children - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE02dlhmYi1qNFpydTRBR3hNczhvWUx4WHJCLTdxS3RBVVE0SWV4akdiQkxnRnlqZFlrWmlaRHUtREVBa1V0WGpRN0NCSUJWSEd5bnF2WkluTHRCaW5Cd0JnYms2YTAyZVRNZVpIMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;New research reveals that small, shallow grooves in the human brain—called tertiary sulci—are closely tied to reasoning ability and brain connectivity in children and adolescents.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published May 19 in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, University of California, Berkeley, researchers show that in children and adolescents, the depths of some small grooves are correlated with increased connectivity between regions of the brain — the lateral prefrontal cortex and lateral parietal cortex — involved in reasoning and other high-level cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The grooves may actually bring those areas closer together in space, shortening the connections between them and speeding communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implication, the researchers say, is that variability in these small grooves, which are called tertiary sulci (pronounced sul’-sigh), may help explain individual differences in cognitive performance, and could serve as diagnostic indicators or biomarkers of reasoning ability or neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The impetus for this study was having seen that sulcal depth correlated with reasoning across children and adolescents,” said Silvia Bunge, professor of psychology and a member of UC Berkeley’s Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute (HWNI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given our previous findings, our former postdoctoral fellow Suvi Häkkinen aimed to test if sulcal depth was correlated with reasoning performance and to test if patterns of coordinated activity within a lateral prefrontal-parietal network could explain this relation between sulcal depth and reasoning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We had explicit predictions about which tertiary sulci in the lateral prefrontal cortex would be functionally connected to tertiary sulci in the lateral parietal cortex, and that panned out,” added Kevin Weiner, UC Berkeley associate professor of psychology and of neuroscience and a member of HWNI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Prefrontal and parietal cortices aside, the hypothesis is that the formation of sulci leads to shortened distances between connected brain regions, which could lead to increased neural efficiency, and then, in turn, individual differences in improved cognition with translational applications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The cortex is sort of haphazardly crunched up into the brain — that’s what I was always taught,” Bunge said. “Kevin came along and changed my mind about sulci.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The hills and valleys of the brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brains of most animals, mammals included, have smooth surfaces. Primates have hills and valleys covering their cerebral cortex. While one group of primates, the New World monkeys called marmosets, have shallow, barely perceptible sulci, those of humans are deeply incised, with between 60% and 70% of the cortex buried in these folds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cortical folding patterns in humans also change with age, establishing their final structure late in prenatal development while becoming less prominent in old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While sulci can change over development, getting deeper or shallower and developing thinner or thicker gray matter — probably in ways that depend on experience — our particular configuration of sulci is a stable individual difference: their size, shape, location and even, for a few sulci, whether they’re present or absent,” said Bunge, who studies abstract reasoning in young people, from 6 years of age through young adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The smallest grooves, many of which are uniquely human, are called tertiary sulci because they appear last in prenatal development and are never as deep as the major or primary sulci that are most evident on the cerebral surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have speculated that the tertiary sulci emerge in parts of the human brain that have expanded the most throughout evolution and have a protracted development, and that they are likely associated with aspects of cognition — reasoning, decision-making, planning and self-control — that develop over a protracted adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But prior to this study, evidence was lacking for a connection between tertiary sulci and brain connectivity. The UC Berkeley study is one of few, all within the past few years, to provide such proof.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sulci linked to cognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weiner and Bunge said that, as undergraduates, they were never taught how to define tertiary sulci; they often examined scans of average brains that did not match any specific individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weiner noticed this mismatch as an undergraduate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the time, all I knew was that I had some cortical squiggles that weren’t in the average brain atlases that we had in the lab. So the question I asked my mentors, Sabine Kastner and Charlie Gross, was: Do I have different structures that aren’t in our atlases or are structures missing from these atlases?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That sent me down a 15-year rabbit hole studying one particular tertiary sulcus in the visual cortex.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That work showed that a specific sulcus, the mid-fusiform sulcus, varied in length from as small as 3 millimeters to as long as 7 centimeters in any given person. Moreover, the longer the sulcus, the better a person was at processing and recognizing human faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“About 2% of individuals have developmental prosopagnosia, which means they can’t perceive faces, and they don’t have any brain damage,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That sulcus, especially in the right hemisphere, is shorter and shallower in those folks than in what we refer to as neurotypical controls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on that rabbit hole, Bunge and Weiner wondered whether tertiary sulci in other regions of the brain, outside the visual processing units, also correlated with cognitive ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon moving to UC Berkeley in 2018, Weiner began investigating the prefrontal cortex — located in the front of the brain behind the forehead — in collaboration with Bunge, who wanted to test whether sulci in this area would be linked to reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2021 paper, the two collaborated to define all the smaller sulci in the lateral prefrontal cortex and created a computer model that identified the tertiary sulci as contributing the most variation in reasoning ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The model identified that there’s tertiary sulci in the lateral prefrontal cortex that are contributing to reasoning skills in kids,” Weiner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expanding on that work in the new study, Weiner, Bunge and their colleagues painstakingly catalogued the tertiary sulci in the lateral parietal cortex, located under and just behind the crown of the skull, and investigated its functional connections with the sulci of the lateral prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For both studies, they studied 43 participants, 20 of them female, who ranged in age from 7 to 18. While in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner, the participants were given a reasoning task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on the brain activity in 21 sulci they had identified in each hemisphere of the brain, and the functional connections between these sulci — including, for the first time, tertiary sulci.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across these individuals, greater depth for several of the sulci implicated in reasoning was associated with higher network centrality across the set of prefrontal and parietal sulci.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience affects sulci&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bunge pointed out that the association between depths of sulci and reasoning does not hold for all sulci, and that sulcal depth may change with experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Do we think that an individual’s capacity for reasoning is set in stone based on their cortical folding? No!,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cognitive function depends on variability in a variety of anatomical and functional features and, importantly, we know that experience, like quality of schooling, plays a powerful role in shaping an individual’s cognitive trajectory, and that it is malleable, even in adulthood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weiner’s lab is creating a computer program to help researchers identify tertiary sulci in the human brain. Most programs only identify about 35 sulci, but when tertiary sulci are included, there are over 100, he said, including new ones that their labs have uncovered together. They argue that sulci could serve as landmarks to compare brains between individuals, since brains vary so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dozens of brain maps have been proposed in just the last five years, but they disagree about the areas of associated regions in the cortex, and there are mismatches between areas at the group and individual level,” Weiner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Examining network architecture based on individual sulcal morphology circumvents these disagreements and mismatches, with the opportunity to glean network-level insight from the local sulcal anatomy that is specific to a given individual.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from Bunge and Weiner, other UC Berkeley co-authors of the paper are former postdoctoral fellow Suvi Häkkinen, former graduate student Willa Voorhies, former undergraduates Ethan Willbrand and Jewelia Yao, and former visiting scholars Yi-Heng Tsai and Thomas Gagnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The work was supported by the National Institutes of Health through grants from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (R21HD100858) and the National Institute of Mental Health (R01MH133637), and the National Science Foundation (CAREER Award 2042251).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bac8d6c9dbd4dedfc8c9fad8dfc8d1dfd6dfc394dfdecf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Robert Sanders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UC Berkeley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Robert Sanders – UC Berkeley&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0726-24.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Anchoring functional connectivity to individual sulcal morphology yields insights in a pediatric study of reasoning&lt;/a&gt;” by Silvia Bunge et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anchoring functional connectivity to individual sulcal morphology yields insights in a pediatric study of reasoning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A salient neuroanatomical feature of the human brain is its pronounced cortical folding, and there is mounting evidence that sulcal morphology is relevant to functional brain architecture and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, our understanding of the relationships between sulcal anatomy, brain activity, and behavior is still in its infancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We previously found that the depth of three small, shallow sulci in lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) was linked to reasoning performance during development (Voorhies et al., 2021).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings beg the question: what is the linking mechanism between sulcal morphology and cognition?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we investigated functional connectivity among sulci in LPFC and lateral parietal cortex (LPC) in participants from the same sample as our previous study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We leveraged manual parcellations (21 sulci/hemisphere, total of 1806) and functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) data from a reasoning task from 43 participants aged 7–18 years (20 female). We conducted clustering and classification analyses of individual-level functional connectivity among sulci.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadly, we found that 1) the connectivity patterns of individual sulci could be differentiated – and more accurately than rotated sulcal labels equated for size and shape; 2) sulcal connectivity did not consistently correspond with that of probabilistic labels or large-scale networks; 3) sulci clustered together into groups with similar patterns, not dictated by spatial proximity; and 4) across individuals, greater depth was associated with higher network centrality for several sulci under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results illustrate how sulcal morphology can be relevant for functional connectivity, and provide proof of concept that using sulci to define an individual coordinate space for functional connectomes is a promising future direction.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 21:38:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTE02dlhmYi1qNFpydTRBR3hNczhvWUx4WHJCLTdxS3RBVVE0SWV4akdiQkxnRnlqZFlrWmlaRHUtREVBa1V0WGpRN0NCSUJWSEd5bnF2WkluTHRCaW5Cd0JnYms2YTAyZVRNZVpIMA</guid></item><item><title>这种形式的中年痴呆症经常被误认为是抑郁症。现在，医生终于有了答案- AOL.com | This Form Of Midlife Dementia Is Often Mistaken For Depression.

The researchers compared those proteins to ones from 39 of the patients’ healthy relatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that patients with frontotemporal dementia had changes in the proteins that suggest they have problems with RNA regulation, which is required for the correct gene expression in the brain. (Gene expression can impact how your brain works.) These patients also had certain changes that impacted connections in their brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These proteins could be the first markers for frontotemporal dementia that surface when people develop the disease, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are these proteins so important&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons. First, "frontotemporal dementia can be caused by several very different types of brain pathology, making it very difficult to provide an accurate diagnosis to patients,” explains &lt;a href="https://memory.ucsf.edu/people/rowan-saloner" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Rowan Saloner;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Rowan Saloner&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, study co-author and professor in the UC San Francisco Memory and Aging Center. “Right now, we have no way to tell which pathology someone has while they’re alive, especially in non-inherited cases, which make up the majority of frontotemporal dementia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But by IDing changes in spinal fluid protein, doctors can detect the disease and track its progression. “That will hopefully lead to more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatments,” Saloner says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s crucial, given that this form of dementia tends to be missed early on, says &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil,&lt;/a&gt; DO, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA. But genetic testing could help give patients and their doctors a better sense of what might be behind their symptoms, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing to keep in mind: This study focused on people with an inherited or genetic form of frontotemporal dementia. “We do not know if genetic frontotemporal dementia and sporadic frontotemporal dementia just look the same in the end but have different paths to development,” says &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev,&lt;/a&gt; MD, MS, is the medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University. “If they have different paths, then this study has helped us learn about genetic frontotemporal dementia. That is useful but not as broadly applicable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else do we know about early-onset dementia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early-onset dementias like frontotemporal dementia usually impact people in their 40s or 50s, Saloner says. “They can be difficult to diagnose, as early symptoms are often misattributed to stress or psychiatric disorders,” he says. “Compared to Alzheimer’s disease, which now has biomarkers and FDA-approved treatments, frontotemporal dementia remains behind.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Segil says that early-onset dementia should be considered “if someone loses the ability to talk or express themselves and other neurological conditions like a stroke, seizure, or infection have been ruled out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Sachdev says that more information is better with the disease. “It is important to know as much as possible about how these diseases arise,” he says. “It gives us something to work from in everyone else.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 21:27:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE5EQ1ByUkx0dnhDemloUmlDb0lRVk9HdllIejVtWVdLYmpveWtiRDhWZ1A1ZXc3T3BYNDJTMEtqNnA5MXFMVi1wcUcwUkxIejZvLUYyRDJPTzNVRDROREs2V3U5OUpRdGVnUm1sTGMxZW5FQWZ6UHQyYkRiMA</guid></item><item><title>“我是一名肿瘤学家，这是我为预防癌症而在每顿饭中添加的食物” -雅虎 | 'I'm an Oncologist and This Is the Food I Add to Every Meal for Cancer Prevention' - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxPcUxMRTdPY3F2dVpxSUtaYWY2Q3VLWVBsa1Q0YVRPRzV5LTJNLXRWdk40QVlQRFA4QXZYRlVWTTRqVjJVREIxeWdqYUJTMmlZZkVVSjlvSVhmSjVvWmRfbVJHZ0JpU3E4RXdoS1RMdWZDZzd5R3FOd2NHWkRZS05PQg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/activities/preventing-cancer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:According to the World Health Organization;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;According to the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;, between 30% and 50% of cancer cases are preventable by having healthy diet and lifestyle habits in place.

It’s why she eats plant-based foods exclusively, as a way to eat lots of inflammation-fighting, polyphenol-containing foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Mussallem says that some of the polyphenol-rich foods she integrates into her meals most often are beans, walnuts, green leafy vegetables, cruciferous vegetables and berries. All of these foods have been scientifically linked to lowering the likelihood of cancer when eaten regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/m-oncologist-afternoon-snack-eat-192500947.html" data-ylk="slk:'I'm an Oncologist—This Is the Afternoon Snack I Eat Almost Every Day for Cancer Prevention';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;'I'm an Oncologist—This Is the Afternoon Snack I Eat Almost Every Day for Cancer Prevention'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/latonya-riddle-jones-md-mph-76045680/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Latonya Riddle-Jones, MD, MPH,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Latonya Riddle-Jones, MD, MPH,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; an internist and pediatrician at Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Center, says she also tries to add leafy greens to as many meals as she can because of their high polyphenol content. “I have a garden and [grow] spinach, kale, cabbage and various greens. I mix some of these foods into my fruit smoothies and sauces, such as spaghetti sauce,” she says, adding that this is a way to sneak greens into meals without her kids knowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;One easy way to up your polyphenol intake is by integrating more spices and herbs into your meals, a tip from Dr. Mussallem. “A pinch of turmeric, a dash of cinnamon, fresh basil, garlic, ginger or rosemary—not only do they bring serious flavor, but they’re loaded with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds. These tiny powerhouses can lower chronic inflammation, protect your cells and even help regulate blood sugar and cholesterol,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/im-oncologist-dinner-swear-cancer-232500844.html" data-ylk="slk:'I'm an Oncologist and This Is the Dinner I Swear By for Cancer Prevention';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;'I'm an Oncologist and This Is the Dinner I Swear By for Cancer Prevention'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What To Avoid Eating if You Want To Lower Your Risk of Cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;All three doctors emphasize that it isn’t only what you eat that’s important when it comes to using diet to lower your risk of cancer; what you don’t eat is important too. They all say they minimize foods with excess sugar or anything ultra-processed. They also recommend minimizing alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I live by the philosophy that every bite is a choice to fuel health or feed disease. That’s why I stick to a whole food, plant-only diet—no ultra-processed foods, no animal protein. Just vibrant, nourishing real plant food. As a 25-year stage IV cancer survivor, heart transplant recipient and marathon runner, I don’t take my energy or health for granted. My food choices are how I show up for this miraculous life,” explains Dr. Mussallem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That said, Dr. Mussallem says this doesn’t mean eating only nutrient-rich foods all the time; food is about enjoyment too! “I always tell my patients: Aim to eat nearly perfectly at home. That way, when you're out and about, you can make thoughtful choices without guilt or stress,” she shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There is such an abundance of polyphenol-containing plant-based foods that it’s easy to incorporate at least one into every single meal. As you prepare your meals, brainstorm ways you can add more plants to your plate. That way, you can lower your risk of cancer with every single bite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up Next:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/people-showering-wrong-order-dermatologists-175000590.html" data-ylk="slk:Related: People Are Showering in the Wrong Order, Dermatologists Say;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Related: People Are Showering in the Wrong Order, Dermatologists Say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Sources&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 21:25:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxPcUxMRTdPY3F2dVpxSUtaYWY2Q3VLWVBsa1Q0YVRPRzV5LTJNLXRWdk40QVlQRFA4QXZYRlVWTTRqVjJVREIxeWdqYUJTMmlZZkVVSjlvSVhmSjVvWmRfbVJHZ0JpU3E4RXdoS1RMdWZDZzd5R3FOd2NHWkRZS05PQg</guid></item><item><title>研究：食物中与白血病生长相关的常见成分- RochesterFirst | Study: Common ingredient in food linked to leukemia growth - RochesterFirst</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxOeGtNaW4wcEFJc0pJVUVKTkRHaWUxMlNSVGF3RDNRekJkRFlGbkV0VTJtS2VFc21nY3ExM2t6LUxXb1AzRzE2UGNzNzJseUNZWW02OVlQVndkX2xDWGlBX1FKT2RxNU9HWFkyeEVGamVZTmRudjA3OUZmSURaN3k0bDBiX1ZJaFlHWlhPcGwxbUloR0lvejBSYXJiTENOS0VuZXVJ0gGoAUFVX3lxTE9YSXVPelBBbm9vLU12dWRZTWM4MHRmNXJMS2p1aktodDl1d0hHcXU0Ulh5ejhXLVVtd1ZXeGVxREowbWN3cDc5eHNvRUZQTW1BYV92VVhVWmd6UjlMOGFlM1VqTEdRUHQwWmRsbDB6QklvVmNPa3BFNEF6MnI0Yk9IakxzRTFKcGRwY1JkSDFxVVBLRll4ZGl0YlhhVFZkcmNoaWJBV1MtWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

While the tour may look a lot like Beyoncé’s Renaissance one, the singer has kept fans entertained by bringing out her nanny (of &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2023/01/shakira-gerard-pique-jam.html"&gt;strawberry-jam cheating-scandal fame&lt;/a&gt;), singing all the deep cuts, and shaking her hips … truthfully. But as of this week, one small hiccup has emerged. On Tuesday, the New Jersey Department of Health &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/potential-measles-exposure-shakira-concert-metlife-rcna208216"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.nj.gov/health/news/2025/approved/20250520a.shtml"&gt;warning&lt;/a&gt; about a potential &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/how-worried-should-we-be-about-measles-outbreak-spreading.html"&gt;measles exposure&lt;/a&gt; to the tens of thousands of concertgoers who schlepped across state lines to see the “Hips Don’t Lie” singer. According to a press release, the alert stems from one non–New Jersey resident who attended the concert while actively infected with measles. The NJ DOH did not specify what section the individual was seated in but is encouraging everyone who was present at Thursday night’s event to call a health-care provider regarding next steps. Officials say anyone who was exposed could start showing symptoms as late as June 6.&lt;/p&gt;

The most effective way to protect against the virus is with the MMR vaccine — a two-part dose that treats measles, mumps, and rubella. But with misinformation about vaccines on the rise, and with anti-vax evangelist &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/anti-vaxxers-upset-rfk-jr-mmr-vaccine.html"&gt;RFK Jr.&lt;/a&gt; serving as Trump’s Health secretary, the country has &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/05/09/measles-cases-2025-states-outbreak-map/83371830007/"&gt;surpassed&lt;/a&gt; more than 1,000 confirmed measles cases this year alone. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that means we’re shaping up for the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_4-map-of-measles-cases-in-2024-2025"&gt;largest outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in the United States in nearly 25 years — scary enough to get RFK Jr. to &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414"&gt;admit&lt;/a&gt; that, actually, people should get the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

Anyone who has not been fully vaccinated or has not had measles in the past is suspected to be at risk. And for her own sake, let’s hope Shakira got her MMR vaccine: She’s got a world tour to finish up, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

Powered by AI-selected DNA “light switches,” the vectors can switch on therapeutic or research genes only in targeted cells, eliminating the need for transgenic animals and enabling fine-grained circuit mapping, activation, or silencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Validated across multiple species and human surgical tissue, the toolkit reaches elusive cells implicated in disorders like ALS, epilepsy, and Parkinson’s disease. By focusing treatment on malfunctioning cells alone, these tools lay a foundation for next-generation brain gene therapies that address root causes rather than symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cell-Specific Vectors:&lt;/strong&gt; Dozens of AAVs precisely target excitatory, inhibitory, vascular, and spinal motor neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI-Found Enhancers:&lt;/strong&gt; Machine-learning algorithms identify DNA switches that direct cell-type-specific gene expression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ready for Researchers:&lt;/strong&gt; All vectors, SOPs, and guides are freely available via Addgene, accelerating global brain research.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;NIH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research teams funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have created a versatile set of gene delivery systems that can reach different neural cell types in the human brain and spinal cord with exceptional accuracy. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These delivery systems are a significant step toward future precise gene therapy to the brain that could safely control errant brain activity with high precision. In contrast, current therapies for brain disorders mostly treat only symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new delivery systems carry genetic material into the brain and spinal cord for targeted use by specific cell types. This platform has the potential to transform how scientists can study neural circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110245"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-spinal-cell-genetic-delivery-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-spinal-cell-genetic-delivery-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-spinal-cell-genetic-delivery-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-spinal-cell-genetic-delivery-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-spinal-cell-genetic-delivery-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-spinal-cell-genetic-delivery-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-spinal-cell-genetic-delivery-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-spinal-cell-genetic-delivery-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-spinal-cell-genetic-delivery-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-spinal-cell-genetic-delivery-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-spinal-cell-genetic-delivery-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-spinal-cell-genetic-delivery-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-spinal-cell-genetic-delivery-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-spinal-cell-genetic-delivery-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-spinal-cell-genetic-delivery-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The delivery systems have been tested, or validated, in intact living systems, which is an important step for introducing new tools for widespread use. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It provides researchers with gene delivery systems for various species used in research, without the need for genetically modified, or transgenic, animals. Examples include illuminating fine structures of brain cells with fluorescent proteins and activating or silencing circuits that control behavior and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Imagine this new platform as a delivery truck dropping off specialized genetic packages in specific cell neighborhoods in the brain and spinal cord,” said John Ngai, Director of the NIH’s &lt;em&gt;Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies® &lt;/em&gt;Initiative, or&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;The BRAIN Initiative&lt;em&gt;®&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With these delivery systems, we can now access and manipulate specific cells in the brain and spinal cord – access that was not possible before at this scale.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new delivery tools, which use a small, stripped-down adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver DNA to target cells, can be broadly applied across many species and experimental systems, including small tissue samples removed during human brain surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The delivery systems have been tested, or validated, in intact living systems, which is an important step for introducing new tools for widespread use. The newly published toolkit includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dozens of delivery systems that selectively target key brain cell types, including excitatory neurons, inhibitory interneurons, striatal and cortical subtypes, brain blood vessel cells, and hard-to-reach neurons in the spinal cord that control body movement and are damaged in several neurological diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Computer programs powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that can identify genetic “light switches,” known as enhancers, that turn genes on in specific brain cell types, using data from many different species – cutting considerable time and effort for scientists looking for these genetic switches.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, this collection of research tools will significantly accelerate understanding of the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the toolkit enables access to specific brain cell types in the prefrontal cortex, an area that’s critical for decision-making and uniquely human traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With other tools in the collection, scientists can better study individual cells and communication pathways known to be affected in several neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include seizure disorders, ALS, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and Huntington’s disease – as well as various neuropsychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AAV-based treatments are already approved for some conditions, such as spinal muscular atrophy for which a 2016 approval of a gene therapy known as Zolgensma transformed the lives of infants and young children who once faced severe disability or early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new collection of gene delivery resources lays the groundwork for more precise treatments that target only affected cells in the brain, spinal cord, or brain blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The toolkit is available at distribution centers including Addgene, a global supplier of genetic research tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This collection of publications offers researchers standard operating procedures and user guides for these tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work is supported by the NIH’s &lt;em&gt;Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies® &lt;/em&gt;Initiative, or&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;The BRAIN Initiative&lt;em&gt;®&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding issued less than four years ago launched a large-scale, team-run project to design new molecular tools that can be useful to many research laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Armamentarium for Precision Brain Cell Access aims to develop precise and reproducible access to cells and circuits in experimental research models of the brain and spinal cord. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The large-scale project brings together experts in the field of molecular biology, neuroscience, and artificial

interneuron subtypes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, we and others have identified a number of enhancers that, when incorporated into rAAV vectors, can restrict the transgene expression to particular neuronal populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet, viral tools to access and manipulate specific neuronal subtypes are still limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we performed systematic analysis of single-cell genomic data to identify enhancer candidates for each of the telencephalic interneuron subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We established a set of enhancer-AAV tools that are highly specific for distinct cortical interneuron populations and striatal cholinergic interneurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These enhancers, when used in the context of different effectors, can target (fluorescent proteins), observe activity (GCaMP), and manipulate (opto-genetics) specific neuronal subtypes. We also validated our enhancer-AAV tools across species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, we provide the field with a powerful set of tools to study neural circuits and functions and to develop precise and targeted therapy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 20:35:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTFBlVmFPb0NvcUItUXFBZmdhT1BTeDdpREFQSHFYT0JsR2dtSGVLSGxRV1VQMnJVNjJYQXJ3U1BwUzQyN0lPazRXRlJXVzFVclVZMlY3b01oZi1EWWJqNFltX2lKSUZHM3dtZFVV</guid></item><item><title>专家警告说，奇怪的新美容趋势会让你的皮肤变成橙色—并且可能会让你进入急诊室-纽约邮报 | Bizarre, new beauty trend turns your skin orange — and could land you in the ER, experts warn - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNQzNLU1hEdHdrS19OX0xfdTdnbE0yQlh4NlAzS0hMbXhaZDgzbFBjRmR4d184a3pUdlEyV3ZVNURFU0UyOVVmSXdxVTROa3NEYzcxbnNLTzlBbmg5aXEyOE9CM2RaZ1FDN2VTMHk3OVdxWVRfenN5Q0VRb0RBY3NDVHhmbXhKaXp6c1ZV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;They’re dying for that glow — one can of carrots at a time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/05/20/lifestyle/men-are-wearing-dangerous-soccer-cleats-as-a-fashion-trend/"&gt;new TikTok trend&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;carrotmaxxing&lt;em&gt;”&lt;/em&gt; is taking root among beauty-obsessed users looking to score a sun-kissed sheen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But instead of bronzed bliss, some people are turning orange — &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/29/lifestyle/what-is-face-basting-how-diaper-rash-cream-can-relieve-dry-skin/"&gt;or worse,&lt;/a&gt; landing themselves in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Fake tan has become too expensive. Time to start carrotmaxxing,” one user, @SydneyPacce, declared on &lt;a href="https://x.com/SydneyPacce/status/1921008445269910008"&gt;X (formerly Twitter) &lt;/a&gt;on May 9 alongside a photo of six cans of sliced carrots and a bottle of Dr. Pepper.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nine days — and an apparent veggie binge — later, she posted an &lt;a href="https://x.com/SydneyPacce/status/1924281142892523721"&gt;alarming update&lt;/a&gt;: “UPDATE: CARROTMAXXING SENT ME TO THE ER.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The beta-carotene-packed trend supposedly delivers a natural tan by turning skin a warmer hue. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But if you go too hard on the carrots, you might wind up with carotenemia — a rather harmless condition that literally turns your skin yellow-orange due to “high levels of beta-carotene in the blood,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/carotenemia-7254408" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Very Well Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Instead of glowing up, some carrotmaxxers are turning traffic-cone orange — or winding up in the ER. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;TikTok/@notsyrianpsycho&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having your skin turn a different color is one thing — but getting sent to the ER for sodium overload from the root vegetable is another. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts warn that the high levels of sodium in canned carrots — the way many are partaking in this trend — can cause some serious harm. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to Harvard Medical School physicians, who wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/heart-failure-and-salt-the-great-debate-2018121815563"&gt;recent statement&lt;/a&gt;, “It’s also highly likely that some patients are more salt-sensitive than others. Thus, directing salt restriction to those most vulnerable might be better than a one-size-fits-all approach.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That was apparently the case for @SydneyPacce, who consumed six cans of sliced carrots daily — not raw carrots, mind you — amounting to over 5,250 milligrams of sodium a day. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;For those partaking in this trend by eating canned carrots — experts warn that the sodium in this pantry item could cause some serious harm.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;TikTok/@kainoalam&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s more than double the American Heart Association’s &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sodium/how-much-sodium-should-i-eat-per-day"&gt;recommended limit&lt;/a&gt; of 2,300 mg, and way beyond the ideal cap of 1,500 mg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I already had heart problems, so all the sodium in the carrots kinda took me out and I went into mild organ failure,” she wrote in a &lt;a href="https://x.com/SydneyPacce/status/1924654038773035064"&gt;follow-up tweet&lt;/a&gt; on May 19. “I’m doing much better now though!”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Carrots themselves aren’t the enemy — &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/12/15/health/drinking-this-beverage-could-benefit-people-with-cancer-or-diabetes-study/"&gt;far from it&lt;/a&gt;. Packed with fiber, vitamin K, calcium and vision-boosting antioxidants, they’re a powerhouse snack when eaten in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;People who want to partake in this trend need to tread lightly.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;markobe – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Since they are known for benefiting eye health and vision, carrots are thought to be loaded with vitamin A, but they actually don’t have any vitamin A in its active form,” said Rosy Rojas, a dietetic intern at Tufts’ Frances Stern Nutrition Center.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“Instead, carrots are filled with carotenoids, mainly beta-carotene, that can be converted to active vitamin A. Our body is able to regulate this conversion, so toxicity is not an issue.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But when paired with sodium-laced canned veggies and a desperate quest for clout, the risks grow, as &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/carrotmaxxing-tiktok-trend-carrots-health-warning-b2754963.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; by The Independent. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the glow-up might be the goal, the carrot craze is proving to be less of a bronzed beauty hack — and more of a cautionary tale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because when it comes to carrotmaxxing, too much of a good thing can leave you cooked.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; America's breakfast cereals are getting sweeter, saltier, and fattier, a new study finds—raising fresh questions about what's really fueling the morning routine of millions of children. The study, published Wednesday in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2834355?guestAccessKey=afac6436-8a44-4b07-b3c3-aed8f522faec&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=052125"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, analyzed 1,200 newly introduced or reformulated children's ready-to-eat cereals between 2010 and 2023; brand names weren't associated. The researchers found that total fat and sodium per serving increased by roughly one-third over that period. Sugar content rose by nearly 11%, with "a single serving exceeding 45% of the American Heart Association's daily recommended [added sugar] limit for children."&lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                                &lt;div id="divStoryBodyBelow"&gt;
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        The study also found that while protein content averaged 1.97 grams per serving between 2010 and 2020, it "decreased significantly" to 1.69 grams in 2023. Dietary fiber held steady before 2021 but then decreased from 3.82 grams in 2021 to 2.94 grams in 2023. The findings are particularly notable given that ready-to-eat breakfast cereals are "the most commonly consumed food product among children aged 5 to 12," reports the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/health/cereal-nutrients-unhealthy.html"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; per USDA data. About a third of American children eat cereal each morning, while only 10% of kids start their day with eggs. &lt;a href="https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/nutritional-value-of-kids-cereals-declines-despite-industry-awareness-052125.html"&gt;Consumer Affairs&lt;/a&gt; notes that "though the study only examined new product launches—and not the full cereal market—it offers critical insight into where the industry may be heading."

&lt;p&gt;Then, one day later, the rats were shown the same image and treated with an electric shock until they learned to connect the image with pain. Finally, the team tested if the rats would freeze in fear in response to the sound. The “unpaired” group didn’t. The rats in the “paired” group did—it turned out human-like complex emotional models were present in rats as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Johansen and Gu confirmed the capacity was there, they got busy figuring out how it worked exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Playing tag&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Behaviorally, we measured freezing responses to the directly paired stimulus, which was the image, and inferred stimulus which was the sound,” Johansen says. “But we also performed something we called miniscope calcium imaging.” The trick relied on injecting rats with a virus that forced their cells to produce proteins that fluoresce in response to increased levels of calcium in the cells. Increased levels of calcium are the telltale sign of activity in neurons, meaning the team could see in real time which neurons in rats’ brains lit up during the experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turned out that the region crucial for building these complex emotional models was not the amygdala, but the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), which had a rather specialized role. “The dmPFC does not form the sensory model of the world. It only cares about things when they have emotional relevance,” Johansen explains. He said there wasn’t much change in neuronal activity during the sensory learning phase, when the animals were watching the image and listening to the sound. The neurons became significantly more active when the rats received the electric shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the “unpaired” group, the active neurons that held the representations of the electric shock and the image started to overlap. In the “paired” group, this overlap also included the neuronal representation of the sound. “There was a kind of an associative bundle that formed,” Johansen says.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Published Wednesday in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2025.05.003"&gt;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;, the research saw 1,031 adults either take 2,000 IU of vitamin D every day or a placebo for four years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Using blood samples, the team measured the length of each person's telomeres, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14171589/lifting-weights-help-reduce-biological-age.html"&gt;repeating sequences of DNA&lt;/a&gt; that protect chromosomes from damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Telomeres shorten with age, and previous research shows people with longer telomeres have a longer life expectancy than those with shorter ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found telomeres were up to eight times longer in people who took daily vitamin D supplements than those in the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it's unclear exactly how vitamin D lengthens telomeres, experts believe it could help reduce the risk of DNA-damaging oxidative stress and promote the release of enzymes thought to make telomeres longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The blood tests measured leukocyte telomere length (LTL), the length of telomeres in white blood cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shorter LTL has been linked to an increased risk of age-related diseases like heart disease and cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the placebo group, LTL decreased 12 percent after two years from the baseline and another 16 percent two years after that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, those who took vitamin D had just five percent less LTL after two years and two percent less two years after that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The experts estimate the group that took vitamin D prevented the equivalent of three years of aging compared to the placebo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Haidong Zhu, first study author and molecular geneticist at the Medical College of Georgia, said: 'Our findings suggest that targeted vitamin D supplementation may be a promising strategy to counter a biological aging process, although further research is warranted.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Telomeres, pictured here, are thought to protect chromosomes from damage. Shorter telomeres have been associated with shorter lifespans (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the exact mechanism is unclear, the researchers suggested vitamin D could create higher levels of telomerase, an enzyme that makes telomeres longer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, vitamin D helps lower oxidative stress, an imbalance between disease-fighting antioxidants and harmful free radicals, which attack cells and tissues. Oxidative stress has been shown to damage DNA, potentially shortening telomeres. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most experts recommend consuming about 600 to 800 IU per day, significantly less than the 2,000 IU used in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most vitamin D supplements contain between 1,000 and 2,000 IU. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Consuming more than 4,000 IU in a day could lead to a dangerous buildup of calcium in the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because vitamin D normally helps the body absorb more calcium, which is crucial for maintaining bone and muscle health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Excess vitamin D causes the body to absorb more calcium than it needs, causing it to accumulate in the bloodstream and then get deposited into tissues in the kidneys, lungs and heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This leads to nausea, vomiting, constipation, dehydration, bone pain and kidney stones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations, including the lack of diversity in the sample size, as most participants were white. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was partly funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, an arm of the National Institutes of Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;If you find running intimidating, know that there is another way to get some fresh air while doing a reasonably intense workout. It’s called interval walking training (IWT), or sometimes  "Japanese walking" or "3x3 walking." It’s a form of HIIT, but it won’t end in you collapsing on the floor, hating your life. Here’s how to do it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-do-the-3x3-japanese-walking-workout"&gt;How to do the 3x3 "Japanese walking" workout&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original protocol for this exercise, as published &lt;a href="https://core.ac.uk/reader/148769277?utm_source=linkout" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2007 by Hiroshi Nose’s team at Shinshu University in Japan, used a lab test to help people determine how fast they should walk during the workout. Since that’s not practical for most of us, a common substitute is to use perceived effort. During the high intensity portions, you walk a strong, fast pace—about as fast as you can without jogging, and without getting too tired. For the low intensity portions, you walk normally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here’s the protocol. It’s simple, and it doesn’t require a warmup, so you can just jump right in: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walk for three minutes at a normal speed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walk for three minutes at high intensity (as fast as you reasonably can).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Repeat those two steps for 30 minutes or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;To time those intervals, you can program any smartwatch to beep at three-minute intervals, or just use your phone. I like the free &lt;a href="https://intervalspro.com/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Intervals Pro app&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on my iPhone; try &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.dreamspark.intervaltimer&amp;amp;hl=en_US" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Interval Timer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Android. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 2007 study, older adults who did this workout four or more times per week, for five months, ended the study with better aerobic fitness and leg strength than when they started. If you’ve ever wondered &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/does-walking-really-count-as-cardio-1846965965" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;whether walking counts as exercise&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this certainly does. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-interval-walking-is-the-new-hiit"&gt;Why interval walking is the new HIIT&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interval walking is starting to become more popular. Garmin’s latest lifestyle watch, the &lt;a data-ga-click="1" data-ga-template="Explainers" data-ga-module="content_body" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-event_label="Vivoactive 6" href="https://zdcs.link/z6orJk?pageview_type=Standard&amp;amp;template=Explainers&amp;amp;module=content_body&amp;amp;element=offer&amp;amp;item=text-link&amp;amp;element_label=Vivoactive%206&amp;amp;short_url=z6orJk&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fhow-to-start-interval-walking&amp;amp;event_label=Vivoactive%206" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vivoactive 6&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, comes with walking workouts, which include intervals similar to the ones in the 3x3 workout. You can see examples of Garmin’s walking workouts in &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/garmins-vivoactive-6-smartwatch-review" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;my review of the watch here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why the love for walking? I see a few forces at work here. First, there’s a lot of over-the-top, go-get-em attitudes in the fitness world, especially on social media. If you’ve been through a few rounds of HIIT hype, you may be sick of trying to push yourself harder and harder (or you were so intimidated by the idea that you never tried.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="pogoClear relative my-10 border-b-[1.5px] border-t-[1.5px] border-dashed border-black py-5 sm:my-14 sm:border-0 sm:py-0" data-ga-click data-ga-template="Explainers" data-ga-module="openweb_widget" data-ga-element="openweb_scroll" data-ga-item="openweb_scroll_midpage" x-cloak x-data="{ commentsCount: null, hasComments: false }" x-init="commentsCount = await window.openweb.getMessagesCount(01JVSYZS86PA2S1K4FHQRCM9TV);

            &lt;p class="relative"&gt;

                &lt;/svg&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;span class="text-sm font-medium text-black"&gt;
                What do you think so far?
                &lt;button class="font-semibold text-brand-green underline hover:text-brand-green-700" x-text="hasComments ? 'Post a comment.' : 'Be the first to post a comment.'"&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The backlash to high intensity fitness can go a bit too far the other way, telling people (often &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/truth-about-cortisol-influencers-blame-for-everything" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;women who have been told to worry about their cortisol&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that they don’t need to lift weights or work hard in the gym; they can just go for walks and do some gentle yoga or Pilates. Take that advice seriously enough, and you won’t end up getting much exercise at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interval walking occupies a place in the middle—harder than a hot girl walk or &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/tiktok-s-cozy-cardio-trend-might-help-you-enjoy-exerc-1850811679" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cozy cardio&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but easier (and more fun!) than a &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/what-the-12-3-30-workout-gets-wrong-and-what-it-gets-r-1848667798" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;12-3-30&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; treadmill trudge. Interval walking is especially accessible to people who don’t have a gym membership or fitnessy clothes: All you need is a pair of shoes that are comfortable to walk in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here’s where I think the real magic of walking comes in: It stops you from overthinking your fitness routine, and lets you just get started.

                A blood test called a PSA can help screen men for prostate cancer but it can also lead to unnecessary treatment.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;News that former President Joseph Biden has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/18/g-s1-67544/joe-biden-prostate-cancer" target="_blank"&gt;advanced prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt; has revived long-standing questions about the benefits versus the harms of a blood test that screens for the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11774093/" target="_blank"&gt;most commonly diagnosed cancer among men&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/prostate/psa-fact-sheet" target="_blank"&gt;Prostate-specific antigen&lt;/a&gt;, or PSA, screening tests are an imperfect tool for detecting prostate cancer, doctors and public health experts say.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is identifying and treating aggressive cancers like Biden's while not unnecessarily treating men with slow-growing cancers unlikely to sicken them. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4485977/" target="_blank"&gt;Autopsies found&lt;/a&gt; the disease to be so widespread that more than one-third of white men and half of Black men in their 70s had prostate cancers that would never do any harm.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"PSA testing alone leaves a lot to be desired as a cancer screening test," said radiation oncologist Dr. Brent Rose, an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The test measures the level of PSA, a protein produced by normal as well as malignant prostate gland cells, in the blood. Elevated PSA can be a marker for cancer. It also can signal a false positive or an inactive cancer, triggering a painful biopsy, and leading to overtreatment with punishing side effects, including impotence, incontinence and bowel dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"PSA screening is beneficial," Rose said. "There are risks, though, and so it is a personal decision whether or not to do PSA screening."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The key is to target and treat aggressive cancers while waiting and watching cancers that might never become troublesome, Rose and other oncologists told NPR. Physicians have been walking this tightrope since they began regularly using PSA tests to screen for prostate cancer in healthy men in the 1990s. There is no other test that effectively screens for prostate cancer — the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/prostate-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank"&gt;second deadliest cancer&lt;/a&gt; for American men, oncologists said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A history of conflicting guidance&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Attempts to balance the possible harms against the number of lives saved have led to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11774093/" target="_blank"&gt;two decades of fluctuating&lt;/a&gt; – and confusing – public health guidelines on PSA screening. In 2012, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force advised against any screening, only to issue a watered-down recommendation in 2018 that men ages 55 to 69 discuss screening with their health care providers. Various physicians' groups offer conflicting guidance for this age group.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In its advice to older men, however, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has been somewhat more consistent. In 2008, the independent panel of national experts recommended men 75 and older not be screened, and since 2018, the panel has advised against screening men 70 and older.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Biden, 82, apparently followed the guidance. He last had a PSA screening test in 2014, when he was 71 or 72 years old, a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/19/nx-s1-5403887/trump-biden-cancer" target="_blank"&gt;spokesman said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For men between the ages of 55 and 69, the task force &lt;a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/prostate-cancer-screening" target="_blank"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; talking to their health care providers about their preferences before deciding whether to get a PSA test. It classifies the recommendation as Grade C, which means it offers only a small benefit and insurers may not cover it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Finding the time to have a conversation about a topic as complicated as the value of prostate-cancer screening can be challenging for most primary-care physicians, oncologists interviewed for this story said. And while some men might welcome what's called "shared decision-making," others find it agonizing. Still, the only advice for men for now is to talk the issue over carefully with their doctors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The case for the PSA test&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Alicia Morgans, a genitourinary medical oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, recognizes the problem and hopes that the task force will address it in new guidelines, which it is currently drafting. In August, she met with the volunteer panel in her role as chair of the medical advisory board for the advocacy group Zero Prostate Cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Morgans believes the current guidance was based on a flawed clinical trial. It concluded that men screened with PSA tests were no less likely to die of prostate cancer than men assigned to a group that was not screened. But the results were muddied because nearly 90% of the men in the control group had at least one PSA test before or during the trial, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Morgans would like to see the recommendation beefed up so more men get screened for prostate cancer and Black men and men with a family history, who are more vulnerable get screened earlier.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I take care of people who have very advanced prostate cancer, as well as some people who have curable prostate cancer," she said, "so my perspective is really skewed by the fact that I really want to make that diagnosis when things are curable."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So does Dr. Matthew Cooperberg, a urologic oncologist and a professor at the University of California, San Francisco. He has pushed to rename early-stage prostate cancer in part to ease the stress of a cancer diagnosis. One possible name, "&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39350309/" target="_blank"&gt;acinar neoplasm&lt;/a&gt;," describes an abnormal growth but one lacking the potential to spread or kill. Cooperberg also advocates monitoring men with elevated PSAs before rushing to biopsy their prostates.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Men should get PSA testing in midlife with the goal of finding aggressive prostate cancer," he said. "If we find low-grade disease along the way, whether or not we call it cancer, we should not treat it. We just monitor it with active surveillance. If we do that, we can erase this cancer."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A new approach to prostate cancer screening emerges&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Tyler Seibert, a radiation oncologist and associate professor at the University of California, San Diego, is not as optimistic about eliminating prostate cancer. But he too is dedicated to finding ways to identify the bad prostate cancers and treating only them.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;When doctors first began doing PSA screening tests, he said, "there was a flawed assumption that was implicit that if you find any kind of prostate cancer, you must treat that kind of prostate cancer aggressively," he said. "Many of them would never have harmed the patient."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A new era in prostate-cancer screening has arrived, Seibert believes. Today, instead of men immediately having their prostates biopsied when they get an elevated PSA test, he and an increasing number of prostate-cancer specialists recommend first getting an MRI and, when possible, watching and waiting.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"For these patients with low-risk prostate cancer, we have really strong evidence that we can follow them closely, and they basically can just carry on with their life," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Not everyone is comfortable with getting periodic blood tests to see if their PSA might be rising and they might indeed need cancer treatment, Seibert acknowledged. But most of his patients do become comfortable with the protocol, he said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Every time you get that blood test, you're kind of a little bit nervous," he said. "If you can tolerate that, and you don't think that it's going to be causing you too much anxiety, then screening makes a lot of sense."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ronnie Cohen is freelance health journalist based in the San Francisco Bay Area.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The study also found that cereals’ protein and fiber content — nutrients essential for a healthy diet — have been in decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The findings, based on an analysis of 1,200 new or reformulated cereal products introduced in the United States between 2010 and 2023, are likely to add fuel to the ongoing debate about the relationship between processed food, mounting childhood obesity and the rising prevalence of chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The debate has gained greater prominence in the months since health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. began using the federal bully pulpit to excoriate ultra-processed foods as part of his “&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.maha.vote/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Make America Healthy Again&lt;/a&gt;” campaign. Mr. Kennedy, who has declared that “sugar is poison,” last month &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/well/food-dyes-ban.html" title=""&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that the Department of Health and Human Services would work to remove some artificial dyes from the U.S. food supply, citing concerns about their impact on children’s health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Shuoli Zhao, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of Kentucky and a co-author of the new study, said the findings were especially notable given evolving consumer awareness about the links between excess consumption of sugar, salt and saturated fat and chronic conditions like diabetes, hypertension and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“What’s most surprising to me is that the healthy claims made on the front of these products and the nutritional facts on the back are actually going in the opposite direction,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The analysis, based on data gathered by the marketing consultancy Mintel, did not identify brand names, nor did it capture information on purchasing and consumption habits. The vast majority of the 1,200 products it analyzed were relaunches of existing cereals, including so-called reformulations that alter a product’s taste or nutritional content, Professor Zhao said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

   &lt;p&gt;A new blood test that detects a hallmark of Alzheimer's is poised to change the way doctors diagnose and treat the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The test, the first of its kind to be &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-blood-test-used-diagnosing-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank"&gt;cleared&lt;/a&gt; by the Food and Drug Administration, is for people 55 and older who already have memory problems or other signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The results show whether the brain of a person with cognitive symptoms also has amyloid plaques, clumps of toxic proteins that build up in the spaces between brain cells. The presence of plaques in a person with cognitive symptoms usually confirms an Alzheimer's diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"I think the blood test is going to really revolutionize the way people with Alzheimer's are cared for and diagnosed," says &lt;a href="https://www.alzdiscovery.org/about-addf/people/howard-fillit" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Howard Fillit&lt;/a&gt;, chief science officer at the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Primary care physicians will now have access to something that can give them a quicker read" on whether a patient has Alzheimer's, says &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.alz.org/press/spokespeople/maria_c_carrillo_ph_d__;!!Iwwt!VrdWEd07buTn9e3_1U59sDhdIjoDbFFDZXMHo1heaKWdign1BJrnWydkO67oLWq1w8L5yJM874hC$" target="_blank"&gt;Maria Carrillo&lt;/a&gt;, chief science officer of the Alzheimer's Association.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One benefit of a readily-available blood test will be more accurate diagnoses, Fillit says, noting that currently, primary care doctors correctly diagnose patients only about 60% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Specialty neurologists get it right like seventy, eighty percent of the time," He says. "With the blood test, we can get it up to over 90%."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/63/Supplement_1/13S" target="_blank"&gt;PET scan&lt;/a&gt; is the gold standard for detecting the amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer's. But the technology is costly, and unavailable in many communities.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another option is to test fluid from a spinal tap, an invasive procedure that most doctors and patients tend to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are already&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/08/02/g-s1-14852/alzheimers-new-blood-tests-amyloid-tau-ptau217-diagnosis" target="_blank"&gt; lab-developed blood tests&lt;/a&gt; that can signal the presence of amyloid. But the Lumipulse assay, made by the diagnostic company Fujirebio, is the first to receive marketing clearance from the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Having such a test is likely to mean that many more people will be diagnosed when their symptoms are still mild, and potentially treatable.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/30/g-s1-63345/alzheimers-survey-americans-testing-treatment-risky" target="_blank"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; from the Alzheimer's Association found that the vast majority of older Americans would take a blood test to find out if they have the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People who are diagnosed while still in the early stages of Alzheimer's may be eligible to receive one of the two &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/27/nx-s1-5309499/alzheimers-was-taking-her-memory-so-she-started-taking-a-new-drug" target="_blank"&gt;amyloid-reducing drugs&lt;/a&gt; now on market.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lab-developed blood tests have been used primarily by researchers, or by specialists in large medical centers. The test cleared by the FDA is likely to attract a much broader audience.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's been through rigorous evaluation, and it provides guidance for prescribers on who's eligible and when the test should be provided," Carrillo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The result should be more testing of people in rural or underserved areas.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Blood tests have given us an opportunity to really democratize this kind of testing," Carrillo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It also means that many more of the estimated &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/getmedia/ef8f48f9-ad36-48ea-87f9-b74034635c1e/alzheimers-facts-and-figures.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;7.2 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; thought to be living with Alzheimer's are likely to get a formal diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To help health health care providers counsel these individuals, the Alzheimer's Association is writing guidelines on how to speak to patients about the results of a blood test, what it means to live with the disease, and what the treatment options are.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The guidelines are expected this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A widely used antidepressant drug could help the immune system fight cancer, according to a new UCLA research study.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, significantly enhanced the ability of T cells to fight cancer and suppressed &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/tumor+growth/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;tumor growth&lt;/a&gt; across a range of cancer types in both mouse and human tumor models, the study, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)00502-1" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Cell&lt;/i&gt;, found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It turns out SSRIs don't just make our brains happier; they also make our T cells happier—even while they're fighting tumors," said Dr. Lili Yang, senior author of the new study and a member of the Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at UCLA. "These drugs have been widely and safely used to treat depression for decades, so repurposing them for cancer would be a lot easier than developing an entirely new therapy."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db377.htm" target="_blank"&gt;to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, one out of eight adults in the U.S. takes an antidepressant, and SSRIs are the most commonly prescribed. These drugs, sold under brand names like Prozac and Celexa, increase levels of serotonin—the brain's "happiness hormone"—by blocking the activity of a protein called &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/serotonin+transporter/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;serotonin transporter&lt;/a&gt;, or SERT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While serotonin is best known for the role it plays in the brain, it's also a critical player in processes that occur throughout the body, including digestion, metabolism and immune activity.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Yang and her team first began investigating serotonin's role in fighting cancer after noticing that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt; isolated from tumors had higher levels of serotonin-regulating molecules. At first, they focused on MAO-A, an enzyme that breaks down serotonin and other neurotransmitters, including norepinephrine and dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-06-drug-commonly-antidepressant-cancer-mice.html"&gt;they reported that T cells produce MAO-A&lt;/a&gt; when they recognize tumors, which makes it harder for them to fight cancer. They found that treating mice with melanoma and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/colon+cancer/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; using MAO inhibitors, also called MAOIs—the first class of antidepressant drugs to be invented—helped T cells attack tumors more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, because MAOIs have safety concerns, including &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/serious+side+effects/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;serious side effects&lt;/a&gt; and interactions with certain foods and medications, the team turned its attention to a different serotonin-regulating molecule: SERT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Unlike MAO-A, which breaks down multiple neurotransmitters, SERT has one job—to transport serotonin," explained Dr. Bo Li, first author of the study and a senior research scientist in the Yang lab. "SERT made for an especially attractive target because the drugs that act on it—SSRIs—are widely used with minimal side effects."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers tested SSRIs in mouse and human tumor models representing melanoma, breast, prostate, colon and bladder cancer. They found that SSRI treatment reduced average tumor size by over 50% and made the cancer-fighting T cells, known as killer T cells, more effective at killing cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"SSRIs made the killer T cells happier in the otherwise oppressive tumor environment by increasing their access to serotonin signals, reinvigorating them to fight and kill cancer cells," said Yang, who is also a professor of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics and a member of the UCLA Health Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;How SSRIs could boost the effectiveness of cancer therapies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also investigated whether combining SSRIs with existing cancer therapies could improve treatment outcomes. They tested a combination of an SSRI and anti-PD-1 antibody—a common immune checkpoint blockade, or ICB, therapy—in mouse models of melanoma and colon cancer. ICB therapies work by blocking immune checkpoint molecules that normally suppress immune cell activity, allowing T cells to attack tumors more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results were striking: the combination significantly reduced tumor size in all treated mice and even achieved complete remission in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Immune checkpoint blockades are effective in fewer than 25% of patients," said James Elsten-Brown, a graduate student in the Yang lab and co-author of the study. "If a safe, widely available drug like an SSRI could make these therapies more effective, it would be hugely impactful."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To confirm these findings, the team will investigate whether real-world cancer patients taking SSRIs have better outcomes, especially those receiving ICB therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Since around 20% of cancer patients take antidepressants—most commonly SSRIs—we see a unique opportunity to explore how these drugs might improve cancer outcomes," said Yang, who is also a member of the Goodman-Luskin Microbiome Center and the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy. "Our goal is to design a clinical trial to compare treatment outcomes between cancer patients who take these medications and those who do not."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Yang added that using existing FDA-approved drugs could speed up the process of bringing new cancer treatments to patients, making this research especially promising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Studies estimate the bench-to-bedside pipeline for new cancer therapies costs an average of $1.5 billion," she said. "When you compare this to the estimated $300 million cost to repurpose FDA-approved drugs, it's clear why this approach has so much potential."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newly identified therapeutic strategy is covered by a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/patent+application/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;patent application&lt;/a&gt; filed by the UCLA Technology Development Group on behalf of the Regents of the University of California, with Yang and Li as co-inventors.&lt;/p&gt;

Previous research has found that nostalgic reflection can promote psychological benefits such as social connectedness, self-continuity, and optimism. However, while nostalgia is typically seen as positive, it is also tinged with sadness, and little is known about how its emotional signature changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim Wildschut and colleagues examined whether the affect (emotion) associated with nostalgic memories fades or intensifies with time, and how this temporal trajectory differs from other kinds of memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers explored this question using a framework known as the Fading Affect Bias, which shows that negative emotions typically fade more than positive ones when people recall past events. The team conducted two experiments to see whether nostalgic events follow this pattern or whether they display a distinct trajectory—specifically, whether nostalgic events become less positive and more negative over time, and how this change relates to specific emotions like regret or loneliness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Experiment 1, 199 university undergraduates were randomly assigned to reflect on either a nostalgic or an ordinary event. After recalling the event, participants rated how positive and negative they felt at the time of the event’s occurrence and at the time of recall. They also completed scales assessing six psychological benefits (e.g., social connectedness, meaning in life). All procedures were completed online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Experiment 2, 197 MTurk workers were assigned to recall either a nostalgic or an affectively neutral event. Participants again rated their emotions at both the time of the event and at recall, including not just general positive and negative affect but also 13 discrete emotions (e.g., gratitude, regret, loneliness). The aim was to assess how these discrete emotions changed over time and whether they helped explain shifts in overall affect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both experiments, nostalgic memories diverged from the typical Fading Affect Bias pattern. Rather than becoming more emotionally neutral, nostalgic events became less positive and more negative over time. In Experiment 1, nostalgic events showed a significant decrease in positive affect and increase in negative affect from occurrence to recall, whereas ordinary events showed a decrease only in negative affect, consistent with the Fading Affect Bias. Nostalgic memories also remained more positive than ordinary memories overall, particularly at the time of the event, and this positivity was a plausible mediator of the psychological benefits associated with nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experiment 2 replicated these findings with a neutral-event control group. Nostalgic events again showed a fading of positive affect and an intensification of negative affect over time, unlike neutral events. Mediation analyses suggested that the emotional changes in nostalgic memories were linked to increases in specific emotions. In particular, increases in regret were linked to the decline in positive affect, while increases in loneliness mediated the rise in negative affect. Interestingly, gratitude increased over time and was a notable exception to the general fading trend, highlighting the complexity of nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors note that both studies relied on retrospective self-reports, which may be influenced by memory biases. While such designs are common in this area of research, prospective assessments could strengthen future findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/02699931.2025.2484646"&gt;Remembrance of things past: temporal change in the affective signature of nostalgic events&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Tim Wildschut, Constantine Sedikides, Bettina Zengel, and John J.

The immune system goes into overdrive and starts attacking healthy tissues and organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can cause a fever, rashes and inflammation in crucial organs such as the liver, lungs and kidneys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Minocycline is&lt;span&gt; prescribed to around 1million Americans every year for &lt;/span&gt;various bacterial infections including pneumonia and in some cases, acne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While facial acne is usually a result of hormonal imbalances and clogged pores, it can also be caused by bacteria on the skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Dunn's case, doctors struggled to pinpoint the cause of her deteriorating condition as her body continued to swell up and develop rashes for weeks at end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recalled in a TikTok video: 'Every single one of [my] organs was shutting down and [doctors] told my parents that [I] was actually going to die.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As doctors scrambled to find out what was happening to Dunn, the then-teenager stopped breathing for about 30 minutes due to the severity of her condition and had to be put on assisted breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://people.com/teen-takes-acne-medication-briefly-dies-from-rare-drug-reaction-exclusive-11704952"&gt;PEOPLE&lt;/a&gt;: 'I remember just feeling like my body was shutting down. I had no idea what was happening to me, and neither did the doctors at first.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However two weeks later, doctors misdiagnosed her with Parvovirus - a contagious virus mainly affecting children that can cause facial rashes and a fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;DReSS symptoms can cause an outbreak of measles-like rashes all over the body. (Stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But she continued to remain in immense pain as her symptoms worsened over the next two months and had to return back to the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eventually, a medical student realized that she was suffering from DReSS syndrome after they had spent a week learning about the disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DReSS syndrome is most commonly triggered by antibiotics and can be caused by any form of the anti-bacterial drug. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its symptoms can cause an outbreak of measles-like rashes all over the body, high fever, increase in white blood cells in the blood, swelling in the lymph nodes and injuries to internal organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exact mechanisms of how the syndrome is triggered remains unknown but experts believe it is usually due to a combination of genetic factors and the immune system's response to certain drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists estimate that one in 10,000 suffer from the condition - out of which one in 10 die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The syndrome is usually treated with a combination of topical steroid treatments and anti-inflammatory medication.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In Dunn's case, as doctors scrambled to find out what was happening to her, the then-teenager stopped breathing for about 30 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After her diagnosis, Dunn told the magazine: 'When they finally told me it was DReSS syndrome, I had never heard of it before. I had no idea an antibiotic for acne could do this to me.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to the severity of her condition, she was asked to use steroid treatments for weeks to suppress her immune system and stop the spread of the rashes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dunn now claims that she has since learned to be extremely cautious with medication and does not take any medication without checking with experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, she has also begun efforts to raise awareness about the syndrome and said: 'If my story can help even one person recognize signs early and get the right diagnosis, then it's worth sharing .'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 17:50:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>FDA首次通过血液检测诊断阿尔茨海默病- AOL.com | FDA Clears First Blood Test to Diagnose Alzheimer’s Disease - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTFBXaDlSQ2hubm0zWGRFcWcyZzVJUWhnNm1jTFNzcDR6d1ZWbElLTzFmLVhXUkItU2ExdWJSVWd0eXNiVS1NUGh3UDkxcE1lM0R6dEg0VFBMZWIwUFJ5OTJMN3JzQk1fQnF1Mm1mVjNBQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt;

They can take this test as a screening test,” he said. “This is a much more simple screening test, with reasonable accuracy, to tell the physician that a person with cognitive decline has symptoms that are actually due to Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the clearance is a step forward, Isaacson stressed that more research is necessary to determine how the blood test results should be interpreted and used to make medical decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/alzheimers-diagnosis-blood-test-fda-gives-clearance-11739232" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 17:42:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFBXaDlSQ2hubm0zWGRFcWcyZzVJUWhnNm1jTFNzcDR6d1ZWbElLTzFmLVhXUkItU2ExdWJSVWd0eXNiVS1NUGh3UDkxcE1lM0R6dEg0VFBMZWIwUFJ5OTJMN3JzQk1fQnF1Mm1mVjNBQQ</guid></item><item><title>眼部检查可以区分帕金森氏症和继发性帕金森氏症-《今日帕金森新闻》 | Eye test can distinguish Parkinson’s from secondary parkinsonism - Parkinson's News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxNQ3hLdllxdDBLcWVucm9qeVk4QlNjUGdhTUZ2aUhuSkFjVW5KUWdKNWJPbjQ3NHh1RVhCUm9mb1pYckJJYnFsMDFSb1lCN2JzdDJla1RRU1NVT2ZINDFPa1ZmNi1RbVRRZUNfUUxBR3Y4MGxjSTRCbUJCUUp2MmtDRG9mVTllRVROYkFyWkRZMTFMRkF6NFFZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imaging of nerves in the eyes may be used to differentiate between &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-is-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt; and secondary forms of parkinsonism, a new study shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41531-025-00969-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Corneal confocal microscopy differentiates patients with secondary parkinsonism from idiopathic Parkinson’s disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;NPJ Parkinson’s Disease&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Parkinson’s can cause abnormalities in nerves connecting eyes and brain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-causes-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;caused by the dysfunction&lt;/a&gt; and death of brain cells that are responsible for making the chemical messenger dopamine. Parkinson’s is marked by &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/motor/"&gt;motor symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as slowed movement, tremor, stiffness, and balance issues. Most people with Parkinson’s have idiopathic disease, meaning the underlying cause is not known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/types-of-parkinsons-disease/#Secondary"&gt;Secondary parkinsonism&lt;/a&gt; refers to health conditions that can cause Parkinson’s-like motor symptoms, but are not actually Parkinson’s disease. Secondary parkinsonism can develop due to drugs or toxins, or because of problems with blood flow or fluid pressure in and around the brain. Since secondary parkinsonism is by definition characterized by symptoms that are similar to Parkinson’s disease, it can be difficult for clinicians to tell the two apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease can cause abnormalities in the nerves that connect the eyes to the brain, which are generally less affected in secondary parkinsonism. These nerves can be visualized using a technique called corneal confocal microscopy, or CCM. In this study, scientists in China tested whether CCM might be used to reliably distinguish between true Parkinson’s disease and secondary parkinsonism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;CCM may have clinical utility as a rapid ophthalmic neuroimaging method for distinguishing patients with [secondary parkinsonism] from [Parkinson’s disease].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study included 45 people with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease and 25 with secondary parkinsonism. The researchers found patients with Parkinson’s had a lower density of nerve fibers detected by CCM than those with secondary parkinsonism. They also tended to have more branch-like protrusions on their nerves than those with secondary parkinsonism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test if these CCM-based measures could distinguish between the two conditions, the researchers calculated a statistical value called the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). This is a statistical test of how well a measure (in this case, CCM) can distinguish between two groups, Parkinson’s or secondary parkinsonism in this study. AUC values can range from 0.5 to 1, with higher numbers reflecting better accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AUC for CCM in this study was 0.924, suggesting high accuracy for distinguishing true Parkinson’s from secondary parkinsonism. The researchers noted they could get even better accuracy if they also included clinical measures like assessments of symptom severity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“CCM may have clinical utility as a rapid ophthalmic neuroimaging method for distinguishing patients with [secondary parkinsonism] from [Parkinson’s disease],” the scientists concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The treatment, called VERVE-102, could transform the future of heart attack prevention by dramatically reducing a person's levels of LDL cholesterol – the so-called ‘bad’ cholesterol – with just one injection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While statins can lower a person’s cholesterol levels by similar levels, these generally need to be taken daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the future,” &lt;a href="https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/our-services/find-consultant/professor-riyaz-patel"&gt;Prof Riyaz Patel&lt;/a&gt; – an academic cardiologist at University College London and a doctor at Barts Health NHS Trust, which has taken part in the trial – told &lt;em&gt;BBC Science Focus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is reality; it’s not science fiction. We’re actually doing it. I’ve had patients of mine in the trial receive this one-and-done treatment, and it’s going to change the face of cholesterol management going forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of managing cholesterol over time like statins, VERVE-102 aims to provide a one-time fix by ‘switching off’ a specific gene, known as PCSK9, in the liver. This gene plays a key role in regulating how much LDL cholesterol the liver can detect and remove from the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, less PCSK9 leads to less LDL in the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing some spectacular results,” said Patel. “This drug turns off a tiny fraction of&lt;a href="https://www.sciencefocus.com/the-human-body/dna"&gt; DNA&lt;/a&gt;, and your LDL cholesterol is lower by 50 per cent for the rest of your life. That’s it. One and done. This is going to be revolutionary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol can build up in the walls of blood vessels, forming plaques that may eventually rupture and block blood flow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High levels of LDL cholesterol increase the risk of this buildup, which is why millions of people (over 40 million in the US, and 7 million in the UK) take daily medications like statins to help keep their cholesterol levels under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VERVE-102 clinical trial involved 14 participants with familial hypercholesterolemia: a genetic condition that predisposes people to heart disease, heart attacks and strokes, due to very high LDL cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initial results of the VERVE-102 injection indicate that all participants responded well to the medication, with no serious side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different doses led to different responses; the four individuals given the lowest dose of VERVE-102 saw average reductions in their LDL cholesterol of 21 per cent, while the middle cohort had reductions of 41 per cent, and the highest dose resulted in reductions of 53 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one participant, in the high-dose group, reduced their LDL cholesterol by 69 per cent after receiving VERVE-102.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Eugene Braunwald – Distinguished Hersey Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, who was not personally involved in this study – added the initial trial data was “promising” and that it suggested “the potential for a new era of cardiovascular disease treatment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verve is currently recruiting participants in a further stage of their clinical trial, who will receive an even higher dose of VERVE-102, in the UK, Canada, Israel, Australia and New Zealand. It expects to announce its final results in the second half of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

Using validated mental health screening tools, researchers found that 1 in 4 children had new anxiety symptoms and 1 in 7 had new depressive symptoms, despite no prior mental health history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These children reported a quality of life comparable to peers with serious illnesses like cancer or cystic fibrosis, with many expressing a deep sense of ineffectiveness and loss of confidence. The findings underscore the urgent need for integrated mental health screening and early intervention in pediatric long COVID care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Onset:&lt;/strong&gt; Nearly 40% of children with long COVID reported anxiety or depression; half had no prior diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality of Life:&lt;/strong&gt; Mental health impact was comparable to that of serious chronic illnesses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; A child’s sense of ineffectiveness was the strongest predictor of poor life quality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Kennedy Krieger Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study from Kennedy Krieger Institute is calling attention to an emerging mental health crisis among children with long COVID. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that nearly 40% of pediatric patients with long COVID reported feeling significant symptoms of anxiety or depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 139 patients evaluated at Kennedy Krieger’s Pediatric Post-COVID-19 Rehabilitation Clinic. Clinicians used mental health screening surveys to assess symptoms reported by the patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The screenings also included measures of key aspects of quality of life including: physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, and school functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 1 in 3 children reported that they were experiencing elevated symptoms of anxiety or depression (i.e. worry, sleep problems, and mood irritability).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dr. Laura Malone, director of the clinic and co-investigator in this research, says half of these children had no prior mental health concerns or diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Long COVID is a complex condition,” said Malone. “We’re seeing children and teens who were doing well before their COVID infection now struggling to attend school, socialize, or even enjoy basic activities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key findings include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 in 4&lt;/strong&gt; children had new anxiety symptoms, and &lt;strong&gt;1 in 7&lt;/strong&gt; had new depressive symptoms, despite &lt;em&gt;no prior diagnosis&lt;/em&gt;—a sign long COVID is triggering new mental health challenges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On average, children reported a quality of life similar to peers with&lt;strong&gt; cancer or cystic fibrosis&lt;/strong&gt;, underscoring the severe functional impact of the condition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The strongest predictor of poor quality of life was&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a &lt;strong&gt;“sense of ineffectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;,” like feeling unable to succeed in life or enjoy activities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These children are losing confidence in themselves and their ability to participate in daily life,” said Dr. Malone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That loss of function can be just as devastating as the physical symptoms. It is important to identify and treat both to improve quality of life for children with long COVID.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While previous studies have hinted at long COVID’s mental health toll, this is one of the first to use standardized, validated measures of mental health issues in a pediatric long COVID population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also warns that traditional screening tools may not capture the full picture, since physical symptoms of long COVID (like fatigue or dizziness) can overlap with those of anxiety or depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Kennedy Krieger urge healthcare providers to integrate routine mental health screening into care for children with long COVID. Early identification could mean faster access to the right interventions, therefore helping kids recover more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this long COVID and mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d592b9b0b4a6babb81b4959eb0bbbbb0b1ac9ea7bcb0b2b0a7fbbaa7b2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Taylor Gleason&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://KennedyKrieger.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kennedy Krieger Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Taylor Gleason – Kennedy Krieger Institute&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 16:28:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBkNnpUN0llRFRrZFp1by1KdXViOVp5R2sxNjBGNnlrVUkxTEtkTy01QnMwNXd1TnYxYVpUR1U4dkZMSC1SNnBWcW43aGM2RFJzLXE4aWdXUnplTlczQzA3TmNvMlZvUGdKX21WMDlCbzNacnVH</guid></item><item><title>专家说，昂贵的阿尔茨海默氏症生活方式计划提供了虚假的希望-纽约时报 | An Expensive Alzheimer’s Lifestyle Plan Offers False Hope, Experts Say - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxNZ2ItcVVyblNKbEtyWUxFcGViNnE1RzFaWTNMdjh4UjZ2NUVwc3dYdk9QNFJaU1ZlWXdHYWE3bzhxLWlmeW9HV19KdUZsbzlCc1ZhY0RrTThuLW1PQ3FmTnVPUnZuWWxBbEJjUXEwOWpUUTlMTFN5aUVmOGNYa2FhYzUxaXBheFpOZUNNNXlHNA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Kerry Briggs had trouble keeping track of the supplements.

There was ginseng, lion’s mane mushroom and the antioxidant liposomal glutathione, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Ms. Briggs, 64, had started taking the supplements last July, a daily regimen that grew to include 34 capsules and tablets along with two scoops of powder. When it became too much, Mr. Briggs began blending them into a shake, to which he added brown food coloring so it looked less like its natural “sickly” olive shade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Ms. Briggs was taking them all because a doctor had told her that with enough supplements and lifestyle modifications, her Alzheimer’s symptoms could not only be slowed, but reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It is an idea that has become the focus of &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/title-2538046" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;television specials&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://youtu.be/UyneMnERmnI?si=5JHTmPvmph-Qim_0&amp;amp;t=8760" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;popular podcasts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://drtalks.com/summit/reverse-alzheimers/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;conferences&lt;/a&gt;; the sell behind mushroom supplements and self-help books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But the suggestion that Alzheimer’s can be reversed through lifestyle adjustments has outraged doctors and scientists in the medical establishment, who have repeatedly said that there is little to no proof for such a claim, and expressed concern that the idea could harm a large group of vulnerable Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Mr. Briggs had come across the idea after learning about Dale Bredesen, who had been performing a series of small and unconventional studies through which he claimed to have designed a set of guidelines to reverse Alzheimer’s symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

              &lt;p&gt;A family vacation to Costa Rica turned sour after 12 of 13 relatives developed symptoms of a fungal lung infection following an excursion through bat-filled caves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In season two of &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt;, the cordyceps fungus—spoiler alert—becomes airborne, meaning the fungal infection can spread not just through bites but also when humans inhale its spores. While the TV show is highly fictitious, airborne fungi are most certainly not. A U.S. family now knows this better than most, since 12 of their members became ill after touring a bat cave in Costa Rica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7417a1.htm"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published Thursday in the journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, researchers described 12 confirmed or probable cases of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24811-histoplasmosis"&gt;histoplasmosis&lt;/a&gt;: a pulmonary infection caused by inhaling the fungus &lt;em&gt;Histoplasma capsulatum&lt;/em&gt;. This fungus lives in soil, frequently alongside bird or bat droppings, and can become airborne if the earth is disturbed. While symptoms are usually subtle, the infection can make infants and immunocompromised people vulnerable to more serious illnesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During a vacation to Costa Rica in December of last year, 12 of 13 family members toured the bat-colonized Venado Caves, an ancient cave system and popular tourist destination. This essentially meant crawling through bat poop for two hours. When they returned to the U.S., everyone—except the one family member who hadn’t toured the cave—became ill to varying degrees, with symptoms including fever, headache, muscle pain, night sweats, respiratory problems, and gastrointestinal issues.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Five family members sought medical attention. Doctors tested four of them for fungal infections, and two tested positive for histoplasma. Two of the patients also had abnormal chest X-rays, one of which raised concern for possible lung cancer. After learning about their spelunking expedition, healthcare providers notified the CDC, which launched an investigation. Notably, the cave they had visited had also likely caused a histoplasmosis outbreak in 1998 and 1999.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Antigen testing for all four patients occurred within 1 month of symptom onset, the optimal time frame,” the team, led by CDC researchers, wrote in the report. “However, because antigen detection sensitivity for histoplasmosis is lower in patients with mild disease who are immunocompetent, the negative test results might have been false negatives.” In other words, given that it’s harder to detect histoplasmosis in healthy patients, the family members who tested negative might still have had histoplasmosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, doctors confirmed that one family member had histoplasmosis, eight members probably did, and three were suspected of having it. Fortunately, none of them became zombies—or had lung cancer—and within 28 days of exposure, they were all on their way to recovery. While doctors usually prescribe antifungal medication for patients with severe histoplasmosis, many cases in healthy individuals &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/histoplasmosis/treatment#:~:text=Most%20cases%20of%20histoplasmosis%20go,infection%20and%20your%20immune%20status."&gt;go away&lt;/a&gt; on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Histoplasmosis is sometimes difficult to diagnose. As such, the researchers urge clinicians to “consider fungal illness in the differential diagnosis of patients with constitutional or pulmonary signs or symptoms after recent caving or other activities associated with risk for histoplasmosis,” they concluded. In collaboration with the U.S. Embassy in Costa Rica and the Costa Rica Ministry of Health, the CDC hopes to see the risk of histoplasmosis included in the Venado Caves tour waiver forms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not surprising that &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt; is so popular. After all, Andrzej Sapkowski—author of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8205437-there-s-a-grain-of-truth-in-every-fairy-tale-love"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that “there’s a grain of truth in every fairy tale.” That seems to hold true, even in a fungal zombie apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0hzjr000r3b778dpii073@published"&gt;The implications of your question trouble me. Do you think your husband is not entitled to self-pleasure? Would you be similarly offended to learn that he uses his … &lt;em&gt;hand&lt;/em&gt; to masturbate? How much control over his sexuality do you think you’re entitled to? You’re gay, so surely you’re aware of the widespread practice of open relationships within your tribe, right? Plenty of relationships survive not only their constituent partners masturbating, but partners having sex with other people, sometimes in large group settings. That’s enough to make a Fleshlight look about as threatening to a relationship as a flashlight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="129" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0hzl4000s3b770qtsoeww@published"&gt;People seek pleasure from sources other than their primary partner for a number of reasons. Yeah, it may have something to do with dissatisfaction, but it just as easily might not. If you are indeed in a monogamous relationship, and I assume so given your reaction to your husband having sex with an inanimate object, maybe all he wants is some variety. People like novelty, and masturbating, even with a toy, is a way to experience it. You are better off going with your gut and what your husband tells you. If you think your sex life is active and fulfilling, it probably is. Unless you are oblivious to signs, you would know if there were an issue. Your husband likely has a healthy libido and an adventurous mind.&lt;/p&gt;

It seems that you do satisfy plenty already. No one can be everything. In the future, instead of confronting your husband over something that intimidates you sexually, you should express curiosity. What does he like about that object and why? Is there anything he’d like to try that the two of you aren’t doing? If you went as far as to ask him to incorporate the Fleshlight in your sex life, you’d be showing him the kind of acceptance that will likely make him comfortable communicating about such things. That could take the mystery out of the situation and make it so you don’t have to wonder if you should be concerned or whether you’re fulfilling his needs.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve suggested going to see a urologist, but Mike is so embarrassed and depressed that he refuses. Now I’m scared we’ll never have sex again! Help!&lt;/p&gt;

For as much as he wanted the threesome, and as much pleasure as it seemed to promise, years of fantasizing were leading up to that moment. That alone can make for a pressurized situation that promotes performance anxiety. Possibly compounding the situation was that you sprung it on him. You and Rachel had the best intentions for doing so and reason to assume that it would go in a mutually satisfying direction, but it didn’t. Anxiety, period, is a huge boner killer, and one can get stuck in a cycle of worrying about not getting hard, not being hard, and then worrying more about how it’s coming across. It can be difficult to break that cycle, no matter how hot the situation or even how affirming one’s partners are. It certainly helps when the partner(s) don’t buy into the anxiety or pressure, but there’s no guarantee that shrugging it off will actually help. Expressions of “sore” disappointment, though, almost certainly make an already fraught situation worse.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="257" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0i94h001q3b77n5l4r5nu@published"&gt;Erectile dysfunction drugs, in addition to opening up vessels and getting the blood flowing, can work as anti-anxiety meds. Knowing you have a little bit of extra lift can abate some of that nervousness and make it easier to perform. It might be that your husband doesn’t have much experience with PDE5 inhibitors since you report that his limpness during your failed threesome was “completely unusual for him.” (Granted, he may have discreetly popped a Viagra or Cialis in the past that you weren’t aware of.) If he has no experience with these drugs, he should get a prescription—they could be a game changer, and they’re easy enough to obtain online with minimal provider contact. I don’t necessarily condone having minimal contact with a provider, but it’s clear that a lot of guys are embarrassed about this stuff, and don’t like visiting the doctor regardless of the issue, so telehealth companies like Hims and Ro are taking a lot of the discomfort out of the process. Yeah, going to a urologist could help Mike—what you describe sounds like a circumstantial ED issue that has psychological roots, but hearing from a doctor that Mike isn’t broken and this issue is fixable could make a big difference. Still, if the guy won’t go, you can’t make him. Maybe you wait it out a bit more, let the problem remain persistent, and Mike may drop his resistance to the doctor. For a non-medical intervention in the meantime, he could try a cock ring. It’s not foolproof, but it may help.&lt;/p&gt;

Your sister wasn’t necessarily asking for a solution to her problem, just for your ear and compassion. It sounds like she is more on the emotional side, while you lean pragmatic. It makes a certain kind of sense that you bought her a sex toy, given her issues, and I’m sure you meant well. But you did this, by your own admission, because of her dating problems. She reacted emotionally, but a version of, “You bought this for me because I couldn’t get a man,” is the truth. The gift may have, in fact, reminded her of her dating frustrations primarily, so much so that it didn’t have a shot at ameliorating her sexual ones—if she even has those! She may not be having issues finding sex, or she may already have sex toys she uses and likes, rendering the potential usefulness of your gift moot.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s really never a safe bet to give someone a sex toy, unless you’re intimately involved with them and know they like them. Did you act incorrectly? Well, kinda. I think your intentions were pure, but not necessarily well thought out, and when it comes to giving gifts, it really is the thought that counts.&lt;/p&gt;

I also haven’t been on a date. My life has pretty much been surrounded by doctors and hospitals as I learn to cope with chronic illness. But I’m at a point now where I’d like to date and maybe have sex again. But I don’t know where to start. I’m submissive, and this might sound weird, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/07/sexual-fantasy-smell-sex-advice.html"&gt;but the absolute most important thing is they have to smell “right.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            Science has pretty well established that the brain isn’t static; it changes and adapts throughout our lives in response to life events in a process called &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/neuroplasticity" target="_blank"&gt;neuroplasticity&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6sriz000d3b6m9ch9bsca@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers are discovering this is especially true of female brains, which get remodeled significantly during the three Ps: &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/05/health/teen-tween-developing-brains-wellness/index.html"&gt;puberty&lt;/a&gt; (as do the brains of adolescent males), pregnancy and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/07/health/menopause-effect-brain-gupta-wellness"&gt;perimenopause&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000e3b6mmnui0c2u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All three transitions are a frequent butt of pop-culture jokes: the  sulky, risk-taking teenager who only wants to be with friends; the scattered mom-to-be who leaves her cell phone in the fridge and can’t remember where she parked the car; and the hormonal middle-aged woman who can’t focus and spontaneously combusts with hot flashes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000f3b6mdfseylyx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But far from being laughable, these behavioral stereotypes are the external manifestations of big internal shifts, many of them linked to the effects of fluctuating hormones on the brain.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000g3b6md9args8h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cognitive neuroscientist Laura Pritschet, a postdoctoral fellow in the department of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, is fascinated by how female hormones, including estrogen and progesterone, affect the brain’s organization and functioning.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000h3b6m7fpfz720@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The reason I chose that field is because I was a budding neuroscientist as an undergrad, interested in brain networks and obsessing over how intricate everything was in the brain to simply allow us to have a personality or remember things,” Pritschet told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently, on his podcast Chasing Life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000i3b6m7u79h7fr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At the same time in my personal life, I was surrounded by menopausal women who were talking about their cognitive complaints and their attention issues,” she said. “I thought we’ve got to connect these two together and understand this more.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000j3b6meb58bn78@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pritschet even volunteered as a “guinea pig” during graduate school, having her brain scanned and blood drawn for 30 days, across two complete reproductive cycles (both on and off birth control pills), to begin to answer the question of how the day-to-day fluctuations in hormones relate to the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8975130/" target="_blank"&gt;day-to-day changes in the brain&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000k3b6m9s4axi0h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Around this time, other researchers were studying what happens in the brain during pregnancy, Pritschet said, looking at the brain before and after gestation. They found many changes, but because the studies took a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27991897/" target="_blank"&gt;snapshot approach&lt;/a&gt;, many questions were left unanswered.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000l3b6mnr7gqlf5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If there’s a 3 to 5% decrease in total gray matter volume, when is that occurring (during pregnancy), and how is it occurring?” Pritschet asked. “We’re missing huge gaps in what we call this metamorphosis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000m3b6m5d3ucroc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;We know that the 40-week gestational window leads to these body adaptations to support the development of the fetus: We have increased plasma volume, immune function change, metabolic rate, oxygen consumption,” she said. “What does this trajectory look like over gestation?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000n3b6m4tqk9xla@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To find out, Pritschet and her team &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/health/how-pregnancy-changes-brain-study-wellness"&gt;tracked the brain changes&lt;/a&gt; in one woman, using MRI and blood draws, from pre-conception and fertility treatment throughout her pregnancy to two years postpartum. Their findings were published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01741-0" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; in September.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000o3b6m1pxwtn0p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax0xc33000b3b6m4tcbehux@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We saw this reduction in gray matter volume pretty much across the whole brain,” Pritschet explained. “We saw increased white matter microstructure and ventricle size.” (Quick anatomy lesson: The brain is made up of gray and white matter. Gray matter is where most of the brain’s thinking and processing takes place. White matter helps connect the different brain areas, allowing them to communicate with one another.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr000v3b6mchlf1wko@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The inflection point was birth,” Pritschet said. “We saw that those reductions persisted into postpartum, with slight recovery, meaning that certain areas of the brain showed this rise in gray matter volume in early postpartum. Others did not.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr000w3b6mfgdmmeob@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pritschet said this “choreographed dance between major features of our brain” is in one respect a physical adaptation to the increased blood flow and swelling that comes with pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr000x3b6mpj8vykm0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, the changes  may also be a preparation for the next stage: parenting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr000y3b6mlbxtaxxf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a fine-tuning of circuits,” she explained. “We know that pregnancy is the lead-up to this time in your life where there’s a lot of behavioral adaptation that has to occur, and new cognitive demands, and a new cognitive load.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr000z3b6m5rjtc4sa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And so the idea here is that there is this pruning or this delicate rewiring to make certain networks or to make communication in the brain more efficient to meet the demands that are going to have to occur,” Pritschet said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00103b6mrusx1xhc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This theory is supported by earlier work. “The first pinnacle papers that came out looking at neuroanatomy in human women from preconception to postpartum found that degree of change in gray matter volume — that sort of reduction — correlated with various … maternal behaviors (such as bonding). Again, that’s all correlation,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00113b6my42uf1re@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That’s an area we need to do a lot more research on, and it needs a lot of context,” she said. “But you can expect that if there’s fine-tuning in these circuits that underlie cognitive or behavioral process, that the more fine-tuning it undergoes, the better performance you’re going to have. That’s the idea — but it’s so much more complicated than that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00123b6mnqa8qzmk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt;hat    happens to the brain during pregnancy? Pritschet offers these three insights.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00133b6mwxox03ed@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The body is the outward sign of a lot of inner upheaval.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00143b6m5rfnesmz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Pregnancy is a transformative time in a person’s life where the body undergoes rapid physiological adaptations to prepare for motherhood,” Pritschet said via email. “But pregnancy doesn’t just transform the body — it also triggers profound change to the brain and reflects another critical period of brain development.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00153b6msg6kzdpl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She called this remodeling   an often-overlooked period of brain development that takes place well into a woman’s adulthood.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00163b6mr79by7ww@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Less gray matter may not sound very positive, but it happens for a reason.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00173b6mfyywoaz1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Despite what one might think, these reductions are not a bad thing, and in fact, are to be expected,” Pritschet said, noting that some of the losses are eventually regained. “This change could indicate a ‘fine-tuning’ of brain circuits, not unlike what happens to all young adults as they transition through puberty and their brain becomes more specialized.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00183b6miv7xuri0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These changes could also be a response to the high physiological demands of pregnancy itself, she said, “showcasing just how adaptive the brain can be.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmax6wc6d001e3b6mnfyb8w86@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="these-changes-could-affect-future-health-and-behavior" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        These changes could affect future health and behavior
&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00193b6m9csq3658@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mapping these changes could open the door to understanding an array of other neurological and behavioral outcomes including postpartum depression, headaches, migraines, epilepsy, stroke and parental behavior.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr001a3b6ma4tqkavx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The neuroanatomical changes that unfold during (pregnancy) have broad implications for understanding vulnerability to mental health disorders … and individual differences in parental behavior,” said Pritschet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr001b3b6mkcyjtpwc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It may even provide critical insight into how the brain changes over a lifespan, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax0ts4800003b6m7ck3rahi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

She lives alone and insists she’s “just fine,” but I can see she’s slipping -- physically, mentally and emotionally. She has high blood pressure, diabetes and serious arthritis, but she won’t stay on her medications. She hasn’t been to a primary care doctor in over five years. She flat-out refuses cancer screenings or even basic lab work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="R4WIVT64Z5HLDM3AKZLE3UCKDI"&gt;Lately, I’ve noticed what could be signs of early dementia -- getting lost on familiar roads, forgetting appointments, struggling to follow conversations. I finally got her to see a neurologist last fall, and they recommended a brain scan and further testing. She never followed through. Now she’s barely leaving the house and won’t let me bring in any outside help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MAD6VREZNJFHZHD33HUSQM5HQM"&gt;I’ve tried small changes to keep her safe -- grab bars in the bathroom, meal deliveries, even offering to go with her to doctor appointments. Every single time, she shuts me down with, “Don’t start” or, “I’m not an invalid.” She’s isolating more and her mobility is getting worse. I’m scared she’s going to fall or end up in the ER with something that could’ve been managed earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VKRTX7T7GJEJXI5TKSZF34HADA"&gt;How do I respect her independence while also not sitting back and watching her decline? -- Worried and Worn Out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QUL4AH3HQRH2TO6X3R73NPXRIY"&gt;DEAR WORRIED: You are carrying a heavy burden, and I commend your patience and devotion. But here’s the hard truth: You can bring a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink. No matter how much you care or how hard you try, you cannot force your mother to seek help if she refuses it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IFL4BN2QTBDX5PTI5JAAIHKORI"&gt;What you &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; do is focus on safety.

The scan, which takes just 8 minutes, detects brain lesions centered on veins—a hallmark of MS—using a technique called T2*-weighted MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers introduced a simple diagnostic guideline known as the “rule of six,” confirming MS if six vein-centered lesions are found. This method not only improves patient comfort and reduces diagnostic delays but could also save healthcare systems millions by reducing hospital stays and complications from lumbar punctures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Invasive Diagnosis:&lt;/strong&gt; The 8-minute MRI replaces the need for painful lumbar punctures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Rule of Six’:&lt;/strong&gt; Finding six vein-centered brain lesions confirms MS diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost and Time Savings:&lt;/strong&gt; Could save the NHS up to £5 million annually and speed up diagnosis by 3 months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Nottingham&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experts from the University of Nottingham have proven that multiple sclerosis (MS) can successfully be diagnosed using an MRI scan, meaning patients no longer need to undergo a painful lumbar puncture.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, published in&lt;a href="https://tracking.nottingham.ac.uk/tracking/click?d=6YgN0DFQukPrBk1uG7SxtALcKtt2EvxsLokElavOHZDGzHyAa6JSlRDrxnK_c2pm89Rj0wPefihwqAUR-WfWEwk6sWrXM5T-YLVLUj6bgScuSf_jfL6tpUonbgB2vU9Gt3cvT52lVHXbtlWkFn0OAuJdnIUBEX7va0nHL8K2ld_hegOT7p2IwyyZRxdGHhTg-w2"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Open Access&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://tracking.nottingham.ac.uk/tracking/click?d=6YgN0DFQukPrBk1uG7SxtALcKtt2EvxsLokElavOHZDGzHyAa6JSlRDrxnK_c2pm89Rj0wPefihwqAUR-WfWEwk6sWrXM5T-YLVLUj6bgScIpMCJLRFmrDuBtNOkBwr2LXYTSqoOGghZrcfqqiQodlMYO_1SFiU7aVsJj6OSE02gEj_5nj0h-f8eIFCJHjy5aA2"&gt;, &lt;/a&gt;an official journal of the American Academy of Neurology, experts from the School of Medicine found that by using a new MRI scan, they could successfully diagnose MS in 8 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110232"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The results show that the use of the T2*-weighted MRI along with the ‘rule of six’, supported the diagnosis of MS as an alternative to a lumbar puncture. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings could provide the NHS with a scientific approach to diagnosing MS which is safer, more cost effective and more importantly acceptable to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MS is a neurological condition which affects around 150,000 people in the UK. It is notoriously difficult to diagnose as it has many symptoms but not all sufferers experience all of them and the disease can progress at different rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently no agreement on the best way to diagnose MS. Frequently, people suspected of having MS have a standard MRI scan and undergo a lumbar puncture, where a thin needle is inserted between the bones in the lower spine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients often report they find it painful, and it can cause unintended complications requiring hospitalisation or time off work to recover. Although the fluid taken during a lumbar puncture can show evidence of disease, this is not always the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abnormalities are not found in everyone who has MS. Some people with conditions that can mimic MS, but need very different treatment, have similar lumbar puncture abnormalities. Both problems can lead to misdiagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lead author of the study, Professor Nikos Evangelou, Clinical Professor of Neurology at the University said: “More than half of all people diagnosed with MS in the UK have had at least one lumbar puncture, following the suspicion of MS diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of our research are particularly exciting as we have now shown that we can give the diagnosis of MS without this painful procedure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used a clinical MRI scanner, of the type all neuroscience centres have, to carry out a special type of scan called a T2*-weighted MRI which is able to reveal lesions in the brain’s white matter that are centred on a vein &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; a known indicator of MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a conclusive diagnosis of MS, the team developed the ‘rule of six’, whereby if there were six lesions found with a central vein, this confirmed a diagnosis of MS without having to analyse all lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team carried out a prospective study, in Nottingham, Cardiff and London with patients who had a suspected, but not definite diagnosis of MS. Each patient was given an 8-minute MRI scan and a lumbar puncture and after 18 months, they were able to find out what the diagnosis was and whether it matched that of their initial scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results show that the use of the T2*-weighted MRI along with the ‘rule of six’, supported the diagnosis of MS as an alternative to a lumbar puncture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of this study and previous research conducted in Nottingham and in the USA the International Committee for the diagnosis of MS, recently announced that the MRI scan, as first proposed by the Nottingham research team, is enough to diagnose MS. A lumbar puncture is no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Evangelou adds: “Not only will our findings have huge benefits for patients, but it will also mean cost savings for the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who have lumbar punctures are required to spend at least most of a day in hospital, and for a health service already at capacity, this creates more issues. If there are complications with the lumbar puncture the stay can be longer. With the MRI scan, it takes 8 minutes, is completely safe, and then you can go home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On average, we think we will reach the diagnosis three months earlier and the change could save the NHS up to five million pounds each year, which can be reinvested in better services for our MS patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this MS and neuroimaging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#97f4fff6e5fbf8e3e3f2b9e0f6fbfbd7f9f8e3e3fef9f0fff6fab9f6f4b9e2fc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Charlotte Wall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nottingham.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Charlotte Wall – University of Nottingham&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1212/WN9.0000000000000017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Comparison of the Diagnostic Performance of the Central Vein Sign and CSF Oligoclonal Bands Supporting the Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;” by Nikos Evangelou et al. &lt;em&gt;Neurology Open Access&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparison of the Diagnostic Performance of the Central Vein Sign and CSF Oligoclonal Bands Supporting the Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background and Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central vein sign (CVS) describes the presence of venules within multiple sclerosis (MS) brain lesions, visible on T2*-weighted MRI. In the upcoming revision of the MS diagnostic criteria, the simplified “rule of 6” (i.e., finding 6 lesions with a central venule) can support the diagnosis of MS as an alternative to lumbar puncture (LP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We evaluated whether a T2*-weighted MRI scan is more sensitive than oligoclonal bands (OCBs) for diagnosing MS at presentation with a typical clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). We also compared the tolerability of LP and the additional MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants requiring an LP to meet the 2017 McDonald diagnostic criteria for MS were enrolled in this multicenter, prospective, diagnostic superiority study from 3 UK neuroscience centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A six-minute T2*-weighted sequence was used to assess the CVS using 2 definitions: a 40% threshold of all eligible lesions and the rule of 6. These were compared with OCBs, using the clinical diagnosis at 18 months as the reference standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of 113 participants, 99 (mean age: 38, female: 73%) have completed all study activities: 80 were diagnosed with MS, 10 remained CIS, 8 had alternative diagnoses, and 1 remained without a diagnosis. No significant difference in diagnostic sensitivity was detected between 40% CVS threshold (90% [CI 81%–96%]) and OCB testing (84% [CI 74%–91%]) (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.332).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rule of 6 had a sensitivity of 91% (CI 83%–96%). Side effects were reported by 75% following LP compared with 9% following MRI. All participants preferred their MRI scan over their LP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVS and OCB testing is equally sensitive in supporting the diagnosis of MS in cases of typical CIS. CVS assessed using the 40% threshold, and the simpler rule of 6 produces equivalent diagnostic performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with OCB testing, CVS testing seems safer and better tolerated by patients. Further studies are needed to evaluate CVS specificity, particularly outside of typical CIS cases, as studied here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Classification of Evidence&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study provides Class IV evidence that CSF OCBs and the CVS are equally sensitive in supporting a diagnosis of MS in patients presenting with CIS.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 15:24:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5zVkhQZ1dDMFI3V2dLOUMwSVBZOEhUQ2VhUHU5T29jTHEtNmpwcGV0Vy1xb1dvSTdLWW1STHZoZzc4ZENQbWdsTW9kNktmSjU5dFpBbU11VUhQWjFZQ2hSb2RxaEV3QQ</guid></item><item><title>优于Ozempic ：科学家揭示最有效的减肥药物- SciTechDaily | Better Than Ozempic: Scientists Reveal Most Effective Weight Loss Drug - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxQbmdWSVcxNlNCZ3NmbkRpR2Fma0RhOE1WRE1rQnhfaEs3X2twVUhTTUtITVcwVWhCWHhqZHBtcWR4aC1WM283MEJwRy1leVlLMUtHZi0wc2tXa1ZNVjZ1Z3hxQmdQZHd4bWVPX2thblBQTjdIZlp2TWdkNFNhZGV1QjBaZDg0TVd1bUthNi1uV0FlaWU4NExGZDE2SQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 15:06:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQbmdWSVcxNlNCZ3NmbkRpR2Fma0RhOE1WRE1rQnhfaEs3X2twVUhTTUtITVcwVWhCWHhqZHBtcWR4aC1WM283MEJwRy1leVlLMUtHZi0wc2tXa1ZNVjZ1Z3hxQmdQZHd4bWVPX2thblBQTjdIZlp2TWdkNFNhZGV1QjBaZDg0TVd1bUthNi1uV0FlaWU4NExGZDE2SQ</guid></item><item><title>官员警告说，在大都会人寿体育场举行的夏奇拉音乐会上潜在的麻疹暴露- NBC新闻 | Officials warn of potential measles exposure at Shakira concert at MetLife Stadium - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxNSnBLSWlOTzVnYl85U3IzR3lVNmhZQ0JMNm16cllyY1BvSGZfS0J5TFB2UGZpSHF0OWhRTHFfc0Fyblh5b3c0a0tKN011ZUdGYmxKNzc5MWlwYlFMazJpcWJhWUFmSjVOS1Y1WEdBWWJxOFBhTFJtdmtpSHVjaVJweU5iLTZYTGVyeW05Qm1KLWZnNnNBX05vRmtsVVVRU2fSAVZBVV95cUxOcXMtTGhHSnZCUHJRUW1STXo4ZEdvcDlGcE1laHoxV2FTTGVmZW85YTUwQzQ1VzdFemExUVVqdmVVMmFyMHo5MTljWWo0ZnQ5UjhpbUJkZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;New Jersey health officials issued a warning about a potential measles exposure during &lt;a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/how-to-get-to-shakira-concerts-metlife-njtransit-strike/4185716/" target="_blank"&gt;the Shakira concert at MetLife Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;On Tuesday, the New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) announced that a non-New Jersey resident attended the concert while infected with the disease.

You should not visit a medical facility without calling ahead. Anyone who was exposed at the concert could develop symptoms as late as June 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Those who are at risk of being infected by the measles are people who have not been fully vaccinated or have not had measles in the past.

The vaccine also prevents complications caused by those three diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Health officials recommend that residents stay up to date on routine vaccinations, including MMR shots. Anyone traveling internationally should also be fully vaccinated before traveling and babies between 6 months and 11 months should get one dose of the MMR vaccine before traveling and two more doses after their first birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Measles symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose, watery red eyes and a rash that usually appears between three to five days after symptoms begin.

Measles can also cause pneumonia and swelling of the brain. It can also lead to miscarriage in pregnant people, premature birth or a low-birth-weight baby, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;The virus spreads through the air when someone coughs or sneezes and can remain in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the area.

NIH-funded breakthrough could enable targeted therapies for many neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research teams funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have created a versatile set of gene delivery systems that can reach different neural cell types in the human brain and spinal cord with exceptional accuracy. These delivery systems are a significant step toward future precise gene therapy to the brain that could safely control errant brain activity with high precision. In contrast, current therapies for brain disorders mostly treat only symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new delivery systems carry genetic material into the brain and spinal cord for targeted use by specific cell types. This platform has the potential to transform how scientists can study neural circuits. It provides researchers with gene delivery systems for various species used in research, without the need for genetically modified, or transgenic, animals. Examples include illuminating fine structures of brain cells with fluorescent proteins and activating or silencing circuits that control behavior and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Imagine this new platform as a delivery truck dropping off specialized genetic packages in specific cell neighborhoods in the brain and spinal cord,” said John Ngai, Director of the NIH’s &lt;em&gt;Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies® &lt;/em&gt;Initiative, or The BRAIN Initiative&lt;em&gt;®&lt;/em&gt;. “With these delivery systems, we can now access and manipulate specific cells in the brain and spinal cord – access that was not possible before at this scale.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new delivery tools, which use a small, stripped-down adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver DNA to target cells, can be broadly applied across many species and experimental systems, including small tissue samples removed during human brain surgeries. The delivery systems have been tested, or validated, in intact living systems, which is an important step for introducing new tools for widespread use. The newly published toolkit includes:&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;Dozens of delivery systems that selectively target key brain cell types, including excitatory neurons, inhibitory interneurons, striatal and cortical subtypes, brain blood vessel cells, and hard-to-reach neurons in the spinal cord that control body movement and are damaged in several neurological diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Computer programs powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that can identify genetic “light switches,” known as enhancers, that turn genes on in specific brain cell types, using data from many different species – cutting considerable time and effort for scientists looking for these genetic switches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this collection of research tools will significantly accelerate understanding of the human brain. Importantly, the toolkit enables access to specific brain cell types in the prefrontal cortex, an area that’s critical for decision-making and uniquely human traits. With other tools in the collection, scientists can better study individual cells and communication pathways known to be affected in several neurological diseases. These include seizure disorders, ALS, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and Huntington’s disease – as well as various neuropsychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AAV-based treatments are already approved for some conditions, such as spinal muscular atrophy for which a 2016 approval of a gene therapy known as Zolgensma transformed the lives of infants and young children who once faced severe disability or early death. The new collection of gene delivery resources lays the groundwork for more precise treatments that target only affected cells in the brain, spinal cord, or brain blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The toolkit is available at distribution centers including &lt;a href="https://www.addgene.org/collections/brain-armamentarium/"&gt;Addgene&lt;/a&gt;, a global supplier of genetic research tools. This collection of publications offers researchers standard operating procedures and user guides for these tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work is supported by the NIH’s &lt;em&gt;Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies® &lt;/em&gt;Initiative, or The BRAIN Initiative&lt;em&gt;®&lt;/em&gt;. Funding issued less than four years ago launched a large-scale, team-run project to design new molecular tools that can be useful to many research laboratories. The &lt;a href="https://braininitiative.nih.gov/research/tools-and-technologies-brain-cells-and-circuits/armamentarium-precision-brain-cell-access"&gt;Armamentarium for Precision Brain Cell Access&lt;/a&gt; aims to develop precise and reproducible access to cells and circuits in experimental research models of the brain and spinal cord. The large-scale project brings together experts in the field of molecular biology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence (AI). The eight papers appear in the May 21 issue of the journals &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cell, Cell Reports, Cell Genomics, and Cell Reports Methods&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A common class of antidepressant medications might be even more useful than we thought. Research out today suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, can fend off cancer and boost the immune system’s defenses against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles, led the study, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)00502-1"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in Cell. In mice and other lab experiments, they found that SSRIs shrunk a variety of cancers, improved the immune system’s ability to kill cancer cells, and bolstered the effectiveness of immunotherapy. The researchers now hope to conduct clinical trials of SSRIs for cancer in humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Serotonin, a hormone with many important functions, has a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ctm2.1750"&gt;complicated relationship&lt;/a&gt; with cancer. While it appears to promote the growth of certain tumor types, it also seems to enhance our immune response to cancer. Accordingly, scientists have hoped that existing drugs that interact with serotonin, including many antidepressants, could be repurposed to fight cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several years ago, the UCLA researchers &lt;a href="https://stemcell.ucla.edu/news/drug-commonly-used-antidepressant-helps-fight-cancer-mice"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a study showing MAO inhibitors—early generation antidepressants that regulate serotonin by inhibiting MAO—had an anticancer effect in mice. But these older drugs can cause serious side effects and interact badly with many other drugs or foods. So the researchers next decided to see if they could find a similar effect by targeting a different protein that interacts with serotonin, SERT. And as luck would have it, we already have existing and safer drugs that can inhibit SERT, the SSRIs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers used SSRIs on mouse and human models of several different cancers (some mice were given cancers derived from human cells, for instance): melanoma, breast, prostate, colon, and bladder cancer. On average, the treatment reduced the size of these tumors by more than 50%. Looking closer, the team also found that SSRIs appeared to make certain immune cells—killer T cells—better at recognizing and killing cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It turns out SSRIs don’t just make our brains happier; they also make our T cells happier—even while they’re fighting tumors,” said senior study researcher Lili Yang, a professor of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics at UCLA, in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1084293"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university. “SSRIs made the killer T cells happier in the otherwise oppressive tumor environment by increasing their access to serotonin signals, reinvigorating them to fight and kill cancer cells.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Yang and her team then paired SSRIs with another treatment that boosts the immune system’s response against cancer, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy; these drugs work by inhibiting certain proteins that normally keep immune cells from attacking tumors. In tests with mice, the combination further shrunk melanoma and colon cancer tumors, and in some cases, it even seemed to completely eradicate the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So far, the findings come from mice and other lab experiments, so we’re still a long way from SSRIs being the next big thing in cancer treatment. But the fact that these drugs are already approved to treat depression is an added boon, the authors say. Compared to experimental treatments, for instance, it would take much less money and resources to develop and potentially win approval of SSRIs for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;UCLA, on behalf of the lead researchers, has filed a patent covering their combination approach, and the team is next looking to put their hypothesis to the test in an actual human trial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to design a clinical trial to compare treatment outcomes between cancer patients who take these medications and those who do not,” said Yang, also a researcher at UCLA’s Goodman-Luskin Microbiome Center and the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With any luck, the same drugs that help ward off the blues can also become part of our arsenal against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Loneliness was closely tied to a cluster of defensive symptoms—pain, fatigue, and low mood—which were especially severe among the poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that social connection helped reduce these symptoms, but the protective effects were strongest for those living in poverty. These findings suggest that social relationships are crucial to buffering the health impacts of economic disadvantage and highlight the need for targeted community support in low-income populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Income-Loneliness Gap:&lt;/strong&gt; 49% of low-income individuals felt lonely vs. 15% of high-income peers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Toll:&lt;/strong&gt; Lonely people in poverty showed the highest levels of pain, fatigue, and low mood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Buffering:&lt;/strong&gt; Strong relationships most effectively reduced symptoms in the poorest groups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Oxford University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study from the University of Oxford, published in &lt;em&gt;Public Health&lt;/em&gt;, shows that European people in the lowest income deciles are much more likely to feel lonely than those in the highest income deciles, despite no difference in how often they socialise. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, both poverty and loneliness were strongly associated with higher scores on a defensive symptom cluster characterised by elevated levels of pain, fatigue and low mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that the symptom-reducing effects of social connection were strongest for people living in poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110228"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two lonely people." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The relationships observed between income level, loneliness and the symptom cluster held even when accounting for things like living arrangements and marital status. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings have important implications for social, economic, and health policy, suggesting that strong social relationships may serve as important buffers against some of the health consequences of poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The defensive symptom cluster refers to set of frequently co-occurring and mutually reinforcing symptoms that, understood from an evolutionary perspective, represent the body’s response to danger and scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans evolved in groups which provided access to resources and protection from danger; when we feel socially excluded or isolated our bodies respond with a set of symptoms that are meant to protect us, for example pain helps protect us from injury, and fatigue and low mood may help us conserve energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers, led by Dr Arran Davis of the School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography, University of Oxford, examined data from a survey of 24,505 respondents across 20 European countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key findings include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;People in the lowest income decile were much likely to report feeling lonely in the last week than people in the highest income decile; 49% compared to just 15%. This is despite there being no difference in the amount of time people in different income deciles reported socialising with family, friends, and colleagues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who report feeling lonely have, on average, higher scores on the symptom cluster. The average lonely person has a symptom cluster score that is higher than 67% of not lonely people. However, the difference in the average symptom cluster score between lonely people and not lonely people is significantly larger in the lowest income decile than the highest income decile. The average lonely person in the lowest income decile has a symptom cluster score higher than 73% of non-lonely people in the same income decile. In the highest income decile, the average lonely person has a higher symptom cluster score than 65% of non-lonely people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30% of lonely individuals from the lowest income decile had high symptom cluster scores compared with just 2% of non-lonely people in the highest income decile, suggesting that social relationships play a particularly important role in influencing the health outcomes of people living in poverty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The relationships observed between income level, loneliness and the symptom cluster held even when accounting for things like living arrangements and marital status.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past research has identified supportive social relationships as buffers to the negative effects of poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings from this study suggest that as material resources decrease the importance of social resources increase, with those who are both in poverty and lonely displaying the highest symptom cluster scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author, evolutionary anthropologist, Dr Arran Davis said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The relationship between poverty and poor health is well established, and previous research suggests that loneliness may be as bad for you as smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study shows that for people who are both on low incomes and lonely the health costs are particularly marked. I hope this study inspires more research into the factors that lead people to feel socially disconnected and to the development of policies that support strong communities in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this poverty and loneliness research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5a36332020333f743e2f342e323528343f1a3b3e373334743522743b39742f31" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lizzie Dunthorne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ox.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Oxford University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Lizzie Dunthorne – Oxford University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2025.02.037" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Associations amongst poverty, loneliness, and a defensive symptom cluster characterised by pain, fatigue, and low mood&lt;/a&gt;” by Arran Davis et al. &lt;em&gt;Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Associations amongst poverty, loneliness, and a defensive symptom cluster characterised by pain, fatigue, and low mood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0015"&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perceived social isolation is associated with increased pain, fatigue, and depression.

Last week the CDC confirmed over 1,000 cases across 31 states, which have resulted in at least three deaths so far. The warning follows a similar alert issued by New Jersey health officials last week after an infected traveller passed through Newark Liberty International Airport, potentially exposing hundreds more people to the infectious disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Daily Beast</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 14:58:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxON3lBckVqRzRUV2FVUlZaWnBLWXVpUG5HSUhrd0t3RWlCUnY0a0lOa2pURVJka1dzWEdQM2lwRWNydmlzR2dZM0dWZ0ZWZE14U3FtSHJYRnNyNDRxWUl5ZHpEaGdfZXo1RU43SHhORnE4NDRTUWRSdkFNb1dhNnV0Zm1wdWlzcjJCNGNiSjZWaFRKanJCOXZGbFdZT1U</guid></item><item><title>为期12年的研究揭示了使您延长寿命的运动类型—这不是有氧运动-汤姆指南 | 12-year study reveals the type of exercise that makes you live longer — it's not cardio - Tom's Guide</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixgFBVV95cUxPNDE1MmRHbHNDeFpFbFp3aGZtQmZwdER2aWtnYWd2a19IcjNGNE5wSjdZUjJLMkZLS3BFa2lwd2lvQW5YV0FPY1BtQWVxc2pGTXFaZDVJcE9Ed0RqSTFLb3czejViZnNzY0NPdnhrNEczVWZjTy04bjV1WXZnTlhuRUY5UHFmTElSeWZiWWZxTFdZanJVQTFtSmlXQk1qbTNUeHZucW9kVkRsOXN5YzdpR0E1N0hRNVJUcG1VM0JtcU9udS1UVWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up your protein. Add collagen. Walk 10,000 steps. Get more sleep. The list of tips for living longer is endless, and much of the advice comes from people with more social media followers than qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Tom’s Guide, the fitness team works hard to cut through the noise. In our latest search for evidence-backed insights, we found a fascinating study that suggests strength training could be a key piece of the longevity puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38595265/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38595265/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research&lt;/a&gt;, the study followed more than 14,000 adults aged 50 and over for 12 years, using grip strength as a simple measure of muscle health. It found that people with lower grip strength had a 45 percent higher risk of death during the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The takeaway is simple: strong muscles aren’t just about how you look, they could help you live a longer, healthier life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-grip-strength"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is grip strength&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grip strength is exactly what it sounds like: how hard you can squeeze something with your hand. Think of it as your hand’s power meter. But it’s more than just winning at arm wrestling or opening stubborn jars. It’s actually a quick, simple way for doctors and researchers to get a snapshot of your overall muscle health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? Because your grip says a lot about how strong your muscles are elsewhere in your body. As this study shows, keeping that strength up might just help you live longer and feel better as you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-are-the-best-ways-to-build-better-strength"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What are the best ways to build better strength&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is, you don’t need to live at the gym or lift massive weights to build strength. In fact, small, consistent efforts can make a big difference, especially as you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-sTaY5QVZLcqQRuKeqdnVGK" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-sTaY5QVZLcqQRuKeqdnVGK slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re starting out, bodyweight exercises like &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/squats-how-to-do-them-and-the-benefits-for-building-leg-strength-and-muscle" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/squats-how-to-do-them-and-the-benefits-for-building-leg-strength-and-muscle"&gt;squats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-do-a-push-up" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/how-to-do-a-push-up"&gt;push-ups&lt;/a&gt;, or even getting up from a chair without using your hands (and repeating for a couple of sets) are great ways to begin.

Just two or three strength sessions a week can help to boost muscle, improve balance, and support long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like with most things in life, the key is to find something you enjoy and stick with it. Strong muscles aren’t just about aesthetics, they can help you move better, feel better, and stay independent for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-more-from-tom-s-guide"&gt;&lt;span&gt;More from Tom's Guide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;aside data-model-name="Bowflex SelectTech 840 Adjustable Kettlebell,Amazon Basics Cast Iron Kettlebell,Gravity Fitness Spartanbell Kettlebell,Bulldog Gear Box kettlebells,ONNIT Primal Kettlebell,JaxJox KettlebellConnect,JaxJox Kettlebell Connect,JAXJOX KettlebellConnect 2.0,Wolverston competition kettlebell,TRX Kettlebell" data-name="Buying Guide Multimodel widget" data-widget-title="multimodelWidgetTitle" data-widget-type="multimodelreview" data-render-type="editorial" class="hawk-base"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-multi-model-review-container"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-multi-model-review-retail-container"&gt;&lt;p class="hawk-title-container"&gt;Round up of today's best deals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

But menopause can also take a toll on your oral health — a lesser-known symptom that deserves a lot more attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Let’s start with the basics: Menopause is officially diagnosed when a person hasn’t had a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-period-underwear-ncna1273695" target="_blank"&gt;menstrual cycle&lt;/a&gt; for 12 months. Leading up to that is perimenopause, a transitional period when reproductive hormones, particularly estrogen, begin to drop. That hormonal shift is responsible for many of the symptoms associated with menopause, including the ones that can mess with your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;To understand what’s going on, I spoke to two experts (a gynecologist and a dentist) who broke down how menopause affects your teeth and gums, plus what you can do to stay ahead of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/menopause-oral-health-rcna208207?featureFlagAix=true#anchor-2dfa70" id="anchor-2dfa70" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;How does menopause affect your oral health?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Estrogen plays a major role in maintaining the health of your oral tissues. When levels drop, your mouth can feel the impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“During menopause, the decline in estrogen can lead to significant changes in the oral cavity, including dry mouth (xerostomia), burning tongue (glossodynia), increased gum sensitivity and changes in taste,” says Dr. Somi Javaid, a board-certified OB/GYN and founder of &lt;a href="https://hermd.com/" target="_blank"&gt;HerMD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Hormonal shifts can also raise your risk of gum inflammation, gingivitis and periodontal disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Saliva production is another issue. “Saliva is essential for neutralizing acids, washing away bacteria and preventing tooth decay,” says Dr. Pia Lieb, a cosmetic dentist at &lt;a href="https://www.cosmeticdentistrycenternyc.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Cosmetic Dentistry Center NYC&lt;/a&gt;. “Without enough saliva, you’re more vulnerable to cavities, infections, and even trouble speaking or swallowing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Menopause can also increase your risk of osteoporosis, which can affect the jawbone and potentially lead to tooth loss or complications with dental implants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/menopause-oral-health-rcna208207?featureFlagAix=true#anchor-ade8fc" id="anchor-ade8fc" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;How to protect your teeth during menopause&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Now for the good news: You don’t have to kiss the health of your teeth goodbye just because you’re in perimenopause or menopause. According to our experts, you can do several things to prevent declining oral health during this time of life. Below, some of the most effective tactics: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice good oral hygiene&lt;/strong&gt;: “Brush twice daily with fluoride toothpaste, floss daily, and use alcohol-free &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-mouthwashes-rcna190988" target="_blank"&gt;mouthwash&lt;/a&gt;,” says Lieb. Regular flossing is also crucial, adds Javaid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay hydrated:&lt;/strong&gt; If dry mouth is an issue, increase your water intake, says Lieb. “You can also use saliva substitutes to keep your mouth hydrated.” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go to the dentist regularly:&lt;/strong&gt; “Regular checkups and cleanings become even more critical during and after menopause,” says Lieb. Plus, routine deep cleanings will prevent plaque buildup. Early detection and intervention can mitigate the progression of oral health complications associated with menopause,” says Javaid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk to your doctor: &lt;/strong&gt;Make an appointment with your gynecologist to discuss overall treatments for menopause that may be suitable for you. “Hormone therapy (HT) may be beneficial for many women, particularly when oral symptoms are part of a broader systemic hormonal deficiency,” says Javaid. “A comprehensive evaluation is essential to tailor treatment to the patient’s needs.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/menopause-oral-health-rcna208207?featureFlagAix=true#anchor-0d2a3f" id="anchor-0d2a3f" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Menopause oral health products to shop&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Experts told us that maintaining oral hygiene is crucial during menopause.

It also has a pressure sensor that alerts you if you are brushing too hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;This floss is an &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-wellness-awards-products-2024-rcna145182" target="_blank"&gt;NBC Select Wellness Award&lt;/a&gt; winner, thanks in part to the fact that it’s made from recycled polyester, vegan wax and coconut oil and allows you to reach the back of your mouth while also soothing gums, according to the brand. NBC Select commerce editor &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/author/jordan-bowman-ncpn1307950" target="_blank"&gt;Jordan Bowman&lt;/a&gt; likes that it is on the thicker side because it easily grabs plaque or food scraps from in between his teeth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="anchor-b6a121"&gt;&lt;div id="rcpd42870" class="" data-testid="article-product-unit"&gt;&lt;div class="listicleProduct dn-print mv8 product__grid-container--small" data-activity-map="listicle-product-article-body-waterpik-aquarius-water-flosser-" data-testid="product-container"&gt;&lt;div class="product__grid-row"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_accordion__Z2nEy styles_accordion__Coahi styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="true" class="styles_accordion__content__09JIS styles_accordion__content__9AV2h styles_closed__PAn2s" data-testid="accordion__content" role="listbox" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsContainer__HAJ1f" data-testid="listicle-product__pros-cons-container" data-activity-map="product-article-body-waterpik-aquarius-water-flosser-"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_prosConsChild__YRDyW"&gt;&lt;p class="styles_prosConsLabel__0oo4d"&gt;What we like&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="styles_prosConsItems__XysO1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Timed settings&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adjustable pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Some people prefer to use a water flosser over regular floss.

It will act as a saliva substitute to hydrate a dry mouth. You get 40 sugar-free melts in a pack and they have a mild mint flavor.

Researchers analyzed DNA methylation, a cellular marker of aging, in men aged 50 to 72 who followed a nutrient-rich, plant-forward lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who consumed more methyl adaptogen foods showed significantly greater reductions in epigenetic age, even after adjusting for weight changes and starting biological age. These results reinforce the idea that specific dietary choices can meaningfully impact how we age at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epigenetic Aging:&lt;/strong&gt; Measured through DNA methylation, epigenetic age reflects biological, not chronological, aging.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methyl Adaptogens:&lt;/strong&gt; Foods like garlic, green tea, turmeric, and berries were linked to slower cellular aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lasting Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Benefits remained significant even after accounting for weight and initial age differences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Impact Journals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new research paper was published in &lt;em&gt;Aging&lt;/em&gt;, titled “Dietary associations with reduced epigenetic age: a secondary data analysis of the methylation diet and lifestyle study.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this study, researchers led by first author Jamie L. Villanueva from the University of Washington and the National University of Natural Medicine, along with corresponding author Ryan Bradley from the National University of Natural Medicine and University of California, investigated how diet influences epigenetic aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110220"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows foods entwined into a DNA strand." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These findings support earlier results from studies on Mediterranean and traditional Japanese diets, both known for their health benefits. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that certain plant-based foods containing natural compounds called methyl adaptogens were associated with a decrease in epigenetic age. This effect was measured using DNA methylation, a marker that reflects how the body ages at the cellular level. The findings suggest that targeted food choices may help slow the aging process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Epigenetic age refers to how old a person’s cells appear biologically, rather than their actual age in years. DNA methylation patterns, which are chemical tags on DNA, can indicate whether someone is aging faster or slower than expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this study, researchers used Horvath’s epigenetic clock, a widely accepted tool, to measure changes in epigenetic age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis included healthy men aged 50 to 72 who had previously completed an eight-week program featuring a plant-based, nutrient-rich diet, along with guidance on exercise, sleep, and stress management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers focused on individual dietary differences to understand why some participants experienced greater improvements in epigenetic age than others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study found that those who ate higher amounts of methyl adaptogen foods—including turmeric, rosemary, garlic, berries, green tea, and oolong tea—experienced greater reductions in epigenetic age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These benefits remained significant even after accounting for weight changes and participants’ starting epigenetic age, suggesting that the foods themselves had a direct impact on aging markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In hierarchical linear regression, foods investigated as polyphenolic modulators of DNA methylation (green tea, oolong tea, turmeric, rosemary, garlic, berries) categorized in the original study as methyl adaptogens showed significant linear associations with epigenetic age change (B = -1.21, CI = [-2.80, -0.08]), after controlling for baseline epigenetic age acceleration and weight changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The natural compounds in methyl adaptogen foods are known to influence how genes behave by affecting DNA methylation. Previous studies have shown that these compounds may support healthy aging and help lower the risk of conditions such as heart disease and cognitive decline.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While this study involved a relatively small group of middle-aged men, it adds knowledge to growing global research showing that diets rich in polyphenols—found in vegetables, fruits, and teas—are associated with slower aging. These findings support earlier results from studies on Mediterranean and traditional Japanese diets, both known for their health benefits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Future research should include larger and more diverse populations and use updated epigenetic aging tools to confirm these results. Based on current evidence, this study highlights a practical, food-based strategy that may help reduce epigenetic aging and support long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and aging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#670a02030e06270e0a170604130d08121509060b144904080a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ryan Braithwaite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://impactjournals.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Impact Journals &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Ryan Braithwaite – Impact Journals&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.206240" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dietary associations with reduced epigenetic age: a secondary data analysis of the methylation diet and lifestyle study&lt;/a&gt;” by Ryan Bradley et al. &lt;em&gt;Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dietary associations with reduced epigenetic age: a secondary data analysis of the methylation diet and lifestyle study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background: &lt;/strong&gt;Aging is the primary risk factor for developing non-communicable chronic diseases, necessitating interventions targeting the aging process. Outcome measures of biological aging used in these interventions are mathematical algorithms applied to DNA methylation patterns, known as epigenetic clocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Methylation Diet and Lifestyle study was a pilot randomized controlled trial of a diet and lifestyle intervention that utilized epigenetic age as its primary outcome, measured using Horvath’s clock. Significant reductions in epigenetic age post-intervention were observed but with notable variability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose:&lt;/strong&gt; This research aimed to identify dietary components associated with epigenetic age change across groups. Contributing factors to variability, such as weight changes and baseline differences in chronological and epigenetic age, were explored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; In hierarchical linear regression, foods investigated as polyphenolic modulators of DNA methylation (green tea, oolong tea, turmeric, rosemary, garlic, berries) categorized in the original study as methyl adaptogens showed significant linear associations with epigenetic age change (B = -1.21, CI = [-2.80, -0.08]), after controlling for baseline epigenetic age acceleration and weight changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the intervention group lost significantly more weight than the control group, these changes were not associated with epigenetic age changes in the regression model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that consuming foods categorized as methyl adaptogens may reduce markers of epigenetic aging.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 14:20:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE93WDhhdDBMcVJreXhCbTdUTV9QVDNXWHhyWk5vS0VLNUU2X19YOGJjeXphejdsOV81Yko4WVZkYmxpdkt3UlNtODNGdVEtOW5jMmJWN3ZLRHBUY3FidW5pM2MxNXpMUGNNTGNpaG4xM2s</guid></item><item><title>阿尔茨海默氏症的血液检测：须知-《纽约时报》 | A Blood Test for Alzheimer’s: What to Know - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE1najFwOHNYSVVLWHEzVDI0cnd1RjVhNGNkQ2ZrVmJiM2xSMTJQUG05ZXBfQWtISVNtUElKNEVYTDBkSHA0dm5nU2p0Q2NLN3lfMEJ5NGhra1N4T3oyYlllcUtYajBrMXctNGRxS3Y1dU9zTDZQaThV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;A blood test that can help diagnose Alzheimer’s disease has received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration. This is a step toward a goal of scientists and doctors to one day be able to diagnose a confounding illness with the prick of a finger. But there is still a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Here is what to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-13o6u42 eoo0vm40" id="link-65060e55"&gt;What is the test, and how should it be used?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The test, manufactured by Fujirebio Diagnostics,&lt;span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;is intended to be used only by specialists in Alzheimer’s, the F.D.A. said. Its mouthful of a name — Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio — describes what the test measures: levels of two proteins, amyloid and tau, that are hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In people who develop Alzheimer’s, amyloid begins to accumulate and form plaques in the brain more than 20 years before any symptoms of cognitive impairment. Tau accumulates later, forming tangles in the brain, and is much more closely correlated with cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-13o6u42 eoo0vm40" id="link-5c27f38e"&gt;Can people who don’t have memory problems take the blood test?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;No. The F.D.A., and Alzheimer’s experts, emphasized that the blood test should be given only to people who are already experiencing cognitive decline and are ages 55 and older.

CLU helps prevent the buildup of toxic amyloid-beta plaques and tau proteins, both key drivers of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice, DDL-357 reduced levels of phospho-tau, improved mitochondrial function, and enhanced cognitive performance in maze tests. Though still in early stages, this candidate drug may work alongside existing treatments and could eventually be used for other neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s and ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeted Protein:&lt;/strong&gt; DDL-357 boosts secreted clusterin (sCLU), which protects against toxic brain buildup.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Gains:&lt;/strong&gt; Treated Alzheimer’s model mice showed improved memory and cognitive function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; The drug may aid treatment for other diseases like ALS and Parkinson’s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCLA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As researchers work to improve treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, new research by UCLA Health identified a candidate drug that reduces levels of a toxic form of a protein in the brain caused by the disease and improved memory in mice by boosting production of a protective protein.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in the &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; journal &lt;em&gt;npj Drug Discovery,&lt;/em&gt; UCLA Health researchers targeted the protein clusterin (CLU), which is crucial in preventing the build-up of amyloid-beta plaques and tau proteins that that disrupt communication between brain cells and lead to memory impairment — a hallmark symptom of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110216"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;One molecule, known as DDL-920, was found to restore cognitive function in Alzheimer’s model mice by jumpstarting the brain’s memory circuitry, specifically targeting gamma oscillations that orchestrate circuits for cognition and working memory. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a decade ago, a variant of the gene that encodes clusterin was identified as the third strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. It was recently reported that increased CLU protein could provide protection against Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UCLA Health researchers led by Varghese John identified a candidate small molecule, DDL-357, that increased concentrations of secreted clusterin (sCLU) in Alzheimer’s mouse models, resulting in a reduction of the toxic protein phospho-tau and improvement of mitochondrial function, both associated with progression of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DDL-357 also improved the memory of treated mice in maze-based cognitive tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings open the door to the development of new treatments that not only target the underlying causes of Alzheimer’s disease but also restore lost cognitive function – something that existing therapies have yet to achieve,” said John, a professor of neurology and director of the Drug Discovery Laboratory (DDL) at the Mary S. Easton Center for Alzheimer’s Disease Research and Care at UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the drug candidate is still in pre-clinical testing and far from human trials, initial results suggest it could work in concert with existing Alzheimer’s disease treatments and may also be effective in treating other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis”, John said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug is one of the latest that John and fellow UCLA Health researchers at the Drug Discovery Laboratory have identified as potential candidates for development to treat Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One molecule, known as DDL-920, was found to restore cognitive function in Alzheimer’s model mice by jumpstarting the brain’s memory circuitry, specifically targeting gamma oscillations that orchestrate circuits for cognition and working memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another study published in April found the molecule DDL-218 worked to increase levels in mouse brain of another protective protein, sirtuin 1, that is lower in people who carry apolipoprotein E4, a genetic variant of apolipoprotein, that confers the greatest risk for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These potential drug candidates provide an opportunity for the testing of new complimentary therapies for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Neuropharmacology and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f2859a9d8781869d9cb29f97969c9786dc87919e93dc979687" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Will Houston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucla.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Will Houston – UCLA&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s44386-025-00009-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Discovery of a small molecule secreted clusterin enhancer that improves memory in Alzheimer’s disease mice&lt;/a&gt;” by Varghese John et al. &lt;em&gt;npj Drug Discovery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discovery of a small molecule secreted clusterin enhancer that improves memory in Alzheimer’s disease mice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite substantial research and drug discovery efforts, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) remains the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, underscoring the urgent need for novel therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mutation in the clusterin (CLU) gene that hinders expression of the cyto-protective secreted isoform of clusterin (sCLU) that affects the aggregation and clearance of two key proteins implicated in AD, Aβ and tau, is the third most significant genetic risk factor for late-onset AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we present findings from our drug discovery program to identify small molecules that enhance sCLU levels and assess their impact on AD pathology and cognition in a murine model of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high-throughput screening campaign identified two classes of epigenetic modulators that increase sCLU levels with subsequent medicinal chemistry efforts leading to bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitor new chemical entities (NCEs) with enhanced potency, drug-like properties, and oral brain bioavailability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lead candidate NCE, DDL-357, increased brain sCLU in the murine ApoE4TR-5XFAD model of AD in a subchronic study. In a follow-up chronic study in the murine 3xTg-AD model, DDL-357 reduced phospho-tau in brain and led to improvements in mouse performance and memory in the Barnes maze testing paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proteomic analysis of brain tissue from both AD models revealed changes in proteins involved in mitochondrial function and synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings reveal the potential of sCLU enhancement as a target for therapeutic development in AD and support the continued development of the preclinical lead candidate.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 13:57:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE9HaVRZUld0dFZGSFg4VUJHRkhaTGV3bzBySmRBUzRiekdtQTluUEtOMVFZaHk3WUV4UFFMOEtEZlpPTmF1a3NpNDlUdUN4M1dBaFpSMkh1aWV1dVlEc3M2YkhfTGJZRlk3U2ZNWTBn</guid></item><item><title>一些节育使用者数年没有经期—安全吗？ - CNN | Some birth control users go years without a period — is it safe? - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQeWRBNTZTWlhOS2I1QjFmaVJaQ3VpTzl6VDExSE9wSVc0cjBSZlhEb050OUFVRUE3RGZ0a0phTW1Sa3RnZDBUZWhlbC02QXlWUl9zVGQtOEdLMDdyS1Z3YWVtNFpxMENlY1lMeE9mZjRBbXB3Q3pGYk15NENlb291dGFlMDVNMEXSAYwBQVVfeXFMTXlBb0ZHOVJpOU5JRm5sVEVqWG5uSm9wWXJCc3gyQkh3UTJPNE5oSUk0X0pTVDdybU5FU05WdW9ST2V0UEtXclRuUGNfaE9mU2s4aGlwdHBOR1VxM25lNFp3bk9aUTNRWWcxOUdudjNocF8yb00zeTZNRkZvWHo1TXFhSVZMM3BPcTlLOXY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Don’t like having your period? Hormonal birth control can be used for more than just preventing pregnancy — it’s also a popular way to go months or even years without a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/06/health/nutrition-early-menstruation-wellness"&gt;period&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd00023j6n529amkuf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Continuous use birth control involves taking hormonal pills without what’s called a placebo week or using other methods such as an implant, ring or injections without a break. This method can end the regular bleeding associated with periods, as well as the cramps, migraines and other symptoms of menstruation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            As social media becomes a hotbed for amateur medical advice and personal anecdotes, posts about getting off the pill and preventing pregnancy through nonhormonal methods rake in thousands of views daily on apps like &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/getting-off-birth-control?lang=en" target="_blank"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;. As influencers share their fears about infertility and the possible harms of suppressing your body’s natural processes, reproductive experts say myths and misinformation about hormonal birth control are on the rise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            To understand more about the risks, rewards and science behind using birth control to forego menstruation, I had a chat with reproductive health expert Dr. Kavita Nanda. As an obstetrician-gynecologist and clinical researcher for the North Carolina-based human development nonprofit FHI 360, Nanda has spent over 25 years studying continuous use birth control and other forms of contraception.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How does hormonal birth control work?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd00073j6n6agm2m3s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Kavita Nanda: &lt;/strong&gt;Combined contraceptives use synthetic forms of estrogen and progesterone&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;together. Combination methods work to prevent pregnancy by preventing ovulation, which is the release of an egg from the ovaries. Other methods use synthetic progesterone&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;only, including pills, implants, injectables and intrauterine devices, or IUDs. Both combined and progestin-only methods make the mucus in your cervix thicker, which makes it hard for sperm to enter the uterus, and the lining of your uterus also remains thin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd00083j6najdzp7sj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What is continuous use? And how does it differ from other methods?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd00093j6nr0not83r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Nanda: &lt;/strong&gt;The standard way to take combined contraceptives is cyclically, every day for three weeks, and then you have a break in the hormones for a week. You either don’t take a pill, or you take a placebo for a week, so you have what’s called a withdrawal bleed. The lining of the uterus sheds, and that’s what people call a “period,” although it’s really just a hormone-free withdrawal bleed. But when we talk about continuous use, you don’t take any breaks. The uterine lining stays thin and intact, and this means that users can go weeks, months or even longer, without a “period.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000a3j6n4tagypqh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How long can you safely go without a monthly bleed?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000b3j6nmv52co2i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Nanda: &lt;/strong&gt;There have been &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004695.pub3/full" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; comparing continuous versus cyclical use, and it’s just as effective and just as safe. There’s no medical reason to have a period or withdrawal bleed when you’re on hormonal contraceptives. As long as you don’t have any contraindications (medical conditions) for the birth control pill, you don’t have contraindications for the continuous use of the pill.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000c3j6nfvhb7bt2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Historically, before contraception, women didn’t necessarily bleed all the time, because a lot of time was spent either being pregnant or breastfeeding. In both of those conditions, there’s no monthly bleeding, often for months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000d3j6nng331tw8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, if you’re not pregnant or breastfeeding, you’re not on hormonal contraception, and you don’t have a monthly period — that’s something you do need to discuss with your provider, because that could signal an issue.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Are there any side effects specific to continuous use?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000f3j6nni0c1shu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Nanda: &lt;/strong&gt;The side effects in general are similar to those with cyclical use. For example, you might have nausea, breast tenderness and headaches (at any time). With continuous use, some people experience unexpected breakthrough bleeding or spotting, especially initially, but this usually improves over time, and many people do achieve amenorrhea or (the) cessation of menses. For some people, it may take three to four months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000g3j6nwngmmro1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How does continuous use affect fertility after stopping?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Nanda: &lt;/strong&gt;There’s no evidence that long-term use of hormonal contraception — whether it’s combined hormonal interception, taken continuously or cyclically — causes infertility, and fertility typically returns within a month or two. Basically, once you stop, the (synthetic) hormones go away very quickly from the blood, ovulation is no longer suppressed, your normal estrogen and progesterone production resume. Assuming that you had normal menstrual cycles before, they would resume. (One exception is) if you’re taking something like the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10335688/#:~:text=The%20proportion%20of%20fertility%20return%20among%20pregnant%20women%20who%20used,100%25%20and%2097.8%25%20respectively." target="_blank"&gt;Depo Provera contraceptive injection&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t cause infertility, but it may take longer for fertility to return after injections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000i3j6n6mz3kz4m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Why were placebo pills invented if there’s no harm in skipping them?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Nanda: &lt;/strong&gt;When the combined oral contraceptive pill was developed in the 1950s, the now-standard 21 days of active pills followed by a seven-day hormone-free interval was not based on medical necessity, but rather on cultural and strategic reasons. At the time, there was a widely held belief that menstruating every 28 days was a sign of normal female reproductive function.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000k3j6nkw075xiy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To align with that expectation, the regimen was designed to mimic a natural menstrual cycle, with a monthly withdrawal bleed intended to reassure both users and physicians that they were not pregnant — important in an era before home pregnancy tests were readily available — and, at the time, to help ease religious and societal resistance to contraception.

            &lt;strong&gt;Nanda: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s really a personal preference and a discussion between a person and their provider. Someone might not want to have a period for years, or some people prefer to bleed three times a year. Some people feel reassured by monthly bleeding. Continuous use may be especially helpful for people who have painful periods, heavy periods, endometriosis, migraines, iron-deficiency anemia, physical or intellectual disabilities, and transgender individuals.

Researchers found that people with HSV-1 were 80% more likely to have Alzheimer’s, while those treated with antiviral medications had a 17% lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings align with other evidence that HSV-1 may trigger inflammation and amyloid-beta accumulation in the brain, hallmarks of Alzheimer’s pathology. Although the study is observational and can’t prove causation, it highlights the potential for antiviral therapy as a protective strategy and urges greater public health focus on herpes virus prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;80% Higher Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; People with HSV-1 were significantly more likely to develop Alzheimer’s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antiviral Benefit:&lt;/strong&gt; HSV-1 patients who took antiviral drugs had a 17% lower Alzheimer’s risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological Link:&lt;/strong&gt; HSV-1 may drive brain inflammation and amyloid buildup, contributing to dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;BMJ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptomatic infection with the virus responsible for cold sores around the mouth–herpes simplex 1, or HSV-1 for short—may have a key role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease, suggests a large pharma industry-funded US study published in the open access journal &lt;em&gt;BMJ Open&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But treatment with antiviral therapy seems to be linked to a lower risk of this type of dementia, suggesting that treatment to quell HSV-1 symptoms may be protective, the findings indicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110212"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Nearly two thirds (65%) of those with Alzheimer’s disease were women. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, around 35.6 million people worldwide live with dementia, and 7.7million new cases are diagnosed every year, say the researchers. Alzheimer’s disease comprises 60%–80% of all dementias, with total costs for its treatment reaching US$305 billion in 2020, they add.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various infectious agents have been implicated in the development of Alzheimer’s disease, and the most studied of these is HSV-1, which affected more than two-thirds of under 50s around the globe in 2016 alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To shed further light on the mooted role of HSV-1 in Alzheimer’s disease and the potential protective effects of antiherpetic drugs, the researchers drew on a large set of US administrative claims data (IQVIA PharMetrics Plus) for the period 2006-21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease were matched for age, sex, geographical region, database entry year, and number of healthcare visits with those without any history of neurological disease, resulting in a total of 344,628 case–control pairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly two thirds (65%) of those with Alzheimer’s disease were women. Their average age was 73 and they tended to have more co-existing conditions—all risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all, 1507 (just under 0.5%) people with Alzheimer’s disease had been diagnosed with HSV-1 (0.44%) compared with 823 (just under 0.25%) of those in the comparison (control) group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the risk of Alzheimer’s disease rose in tandem with age. But, overall, the likelihood of an HSV-1 diagnosis was 80% higher among those with Alzheimer’s disease, after adjusting for potentially influential factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the 2330 people with a history of HSV-1 infection, 931 (40%) used antiherpetic medication after their diagnosis. And they were 17% less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease than those who didn’t use these treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at the potential role of other herpes viruses, including HSV-2, varicella zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus. Both HSV-2 and varicella zoster virus infections were also associated with a heightened risk of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly how HSV-1 and other neurotropic viruses might heighten the risk of dementia isn’t clear, point out the researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, studies have shown that inflammatory alterations in the brain caused by HSV infection are pivotal in [Alzheimer’s disease] development,” they explain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It has been reported that Aβ peptides are deposited in response to HSV infection and protect host cells by blocking viral fusion with the plasma membrane, pointing to HSV as a potential risk factor for [Alzheimer’s disease]. Consistently, Aβ exhibits antimicrobial properties against various pathogens, including HSV-1,” they add.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSV-1 DNA is also found in the plaques characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease, and people carrying the ApoE ε4 allele, the most common genetic risk factor for the disease, are more susceptible to HSV infections, they note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an observational study, and as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. And the researchers acknowledge that HSV-1 infections before the patient’s inclusion in the database weren’t known, added to which many people with the infection don’t have symptoms, while others might not seek treatment when they do–all factors that might influence the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But their findings are in line with those of other studies. And they suggest: “While the molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated, these results are indicative of a possible role for antiherpetic therapy in mitigating dementia risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And they conclude: “These findings place an even greater emphasis on viewing the prevention of herpes viruses as a public health priority. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this virology and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3c515958555d4e59505d485553524f7c5e5156125f5351" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Emma Dickinson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmj.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;BMJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Emma Dickinson – BMJ&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;BMJ Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 13:26:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFBIZU80b2Jfa3Y5ek5ROHg0d2ZBS0F3S1I4SDByVmdQX0Y3QmJfblNkR0xBZE53dlktRDMyMHVpdDhwVDRyZy1nYWcwS0RKTWVSdGR5clhKSF82ajZVMUxoRGthcjczeF82TzA5azVjRQ</guid></item><item><title>这些餐厅的食物对我的肠道有什么影响？ -《西雅图时报》 | What has all this restaurant food done to my gut? - The Seattle Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxPV245TWhYTXExUG9Dc1ZXSHJSV2VEcmtIT1lLbWxseXA4VmZWYjFHWTlpSFd5YzV3THdmbFFoQmxjdmJzaVQzNVZubTBRNG53eHdQRjNTNUNzQWlKRGdvMFYwNHh0em8wVF9GMGxQeWRfb3lyTmxmd1hRRzNDclh0aEQ4TklncF9vb1g2VzN3OWxOR3NlNkg3MmdB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxPV245TWhYTXExUG9Dc1ZXSHJSV2VEcmtIT1lLbWxseXA4VmZWYjFHWTlpSFd5YzV3THdmbFFoQmxjdmJzaVQzNVZubTBRNG53eHdQRjNTNUNzQWlKRGdvMFYwNHh0em8wVF9GMGxQeWRfb3lyTmxmd1hRRzNDclh0aEQ4TklncF9vb1g2VzN3OWxOR3NlNkg3MmdB?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;What has all this restaurant food done to my gut?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/stories/CAAqNggKIjBDQklTSGpvSmMzUnZjbmt0TXpZd1NoRUtEd2lscWR2OERSR3JfOEVJMml3UUV5Z0FQAQ?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US:en&amp;amp;oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;View Full Coverage on Google News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 13:19:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPV245TWhYTXExUG9Dc1ZXSHJSV2VEcmtIT1lLbWxseXA4VmZWYjFHWTlpSFd5YzV3THdmbFFoQmxjdmJzaVQzNVZubTBRNG53eHdQRjNTNUNzQWlKRGdvMFYwNHh0em8wVF9GMGxQeWRfb3lyTmxmd1hRRzNDclh0aEQ4TklncF9vb1g2VzN3OWxOR3NlNkg3MmdB</guid></item><item><title>产后精神病可能在家庭中流行-神经科学新闻 | Postpartum Psychosis May Run in Families - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE9PQklzNjN4X3pvelN3aWVqN0g3YzNaWDAwVXE5Yi1rZ3l1aklENy05Sk9TQkRvakNpd2dVNHJ1TG1NdC1TWWhScmVDTkZYVWU0RmIyWmM0V1U0OWd5VVpMTG9BSXRUenYyY1VZNDhmblVaUFU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Women are over 10 times more likely to develop postpartum psychosis if their sister has experienced the condition, according to a major study of more than 1.6 million women. This rare but severe disorder, marked by hallucinations, paranoia, and disorganized thinking after childbirth, can have life-threatening consequences if not treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight a strong familial risk, particularly when bipolar disorder is also present, underscoring the need for early screening and increased awareness. While the relative risk is high, the actual risk remains low, at 1.6%, but understanding family history could allow for preventive interventions and targeted mental health support during the vulnerable postpartum period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Familial Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Having a sister with postpartum psychosis raises a woman’s risk more than tenfold.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bipolar Link:&lt;/strong&gt; The risk increases to 14x if the sister also has bipolar disorder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for Awareness:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite its severity, postpartum psychosis remains understudied and underdiagnosed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Mount Sinai Hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mount Sinai researchers have found for the first time that a woman is more than 10 times more likely to develop postpartum psychosis if her sister had experienced the condition, compared to a woman with a sister who did not. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, which were published May 19 in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; and highlighted at the American Psychiatric Association’s annual meeting press briefing the same day, suggest both genetic and shared environmental influences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postpartum psychosis is a rare but serious mental illness that leaves a devastating impact on mothers in the vulnerable weeks and months after childbirth. It carries increased risk of suicide and infanticide if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the early warning signs of postpartum psychosis are severe mood swings, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, insomnia, paranoia, and thoughts of self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the devastating ramifications of the disorder, it remains vastly understudied and a challenge for physicians to diagnose and address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every woman of childbearing age and their physicians need to know about the existence of, severity, symptoms, and familial risk for postpartum psychosis so it can be promptly diagnosed and, hopefully, prevented,” said Veerle Bergink, MD, PhD, Director of the Women’s Mental Health Center at Mount Sinai and co-senior author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At present, too many women at higher risk don’t know it and are left on their own with a new baby and no support. We hope these study findings will help move the needle and impart change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With wider recognition of this particular condition and risk factors for it, we can implement changes to help ease the burden for women during this postpartum period.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mount Sinai study team examined the records of more than 1.6 million women from the Swedish nationwide registries, identifying 2,514 women who had experienced postpartum psychosis within three months of their first childbirth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to finding that a woman is more than 10 times more likely to develop postpartum psychosis if her sister had the condition, the Swedish registry study showed that the presence of bipolar disorder in a sister doubles the woman’s risk of developing postpartum psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women with a sister who has bipolar disorder and postpartum psychosis were shown to be at highest risk; their risk for developing postpartum psychosis themselves is 14 times increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study measured relative recurrent risk for the disorder, which implies increased likelihood of its appearance in another member of the family. This differs from actual risk, which refers to the probability of developing the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers learned that while the relative risk of postpartum psychosis is quite high in full siblings, the absolute risk for women with an affected sister is still low at 1.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings support the view that even though there is overlap between postpartum psychosis and bipolar disorder, these are in fact, distinct conditions,” said Dr. Bergink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope this new data will help move the needle and impart change. With wider recognition of this particular condition and risk factors for it, measures can and should be taken to help ease the burden for women during this postpartum period.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond expanding awareness around postpartum psychosis, this study provides a solid foundation for the next step of research, aimed at early recognition and prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work that involves identifying the genes responsible for this disease is already underway at Mount Sinai in the lab of Behrang Mahjani, PhD, Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re using complex molecular data to investigate the genetic architecture of the disease,” says Dr. Mahjani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Knowing what specific genes are involved will help us dive into the mechanisms and triggers of postpartum psychosis, and if they’re hormone- or immune-related. And that, in turn, could lead us to novel treatments and ways to proactively inform women of their risk before they’re faced with a severe health crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this postpartum psychosis and genetics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e0858c899a8182859488ce848f978c898e87a08d8f958e9493898e8189ce8f9287" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Elizabeth Dowling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mountsinai.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mount Sinai Hospital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Elizabeth Dowling – Mount Sinai Hospital&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.20230576" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Familial Risk of Postpartum Psychosis&lt;/a&gt;” by Veerle Bergink. &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Familial Risk of Postpartum Psychosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Objective:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postpartum psychosis is one of the most severe psychiatric conditions, with high risks of suicide and infanticide if untreated. Although genetic factors contribute to the risk of postpartum psychosis, the extent of familial risk remains to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors compared relative recurrence risk across different family relationship types, hypothesizing that relative recurrence risk for postpartum psychosis varies by degree of genetic relatedness and is higher in female full siblings than in cousins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cohort study consisted of 1,648,759 women from the Swedish nationwide registers, of whom 2,514 (0.15%) experienced postpartum psychosis within 3 months of their first-ever childbirth. The authors estimated the relative recurrence risk of postpartum psychosis for female full siblings and cousins as a measure of familial risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relative recurrence risk of postpartum psychosis in full siblings was 10.69 (95% CI=6.60, 16.26) when adjusted for year of and age at childbirth. Although cousins showed an elevated relative recurrence risk, these results did not reach statistical significance (1.78, 95% CI=0.70, 3.62).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the higher familial risk of postpartum psychosis among full siblings, the absolute risk for women with an affected sibling was relatively low, estimated at 1.60% within the entire population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The observed increased risk of postpartum psychosis in full siblings suggests both genetic and shared environmental influences. However, the lack of significant results in cousins hampers a more accurate distinction between these factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, despite increased relative recurrence risk in siblings, their overall likelihood of developing postpartum psychosis remains low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study underscores the need for further research to better understand the intricate interplay of genetics and shared environment in the development of postpartum psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 12:59:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE9PQklzNjN4X3pvelN3aWVqN0g3YzNaWDAwVXE5Yi1rZ3l1aklENy05Sk9TQkRvakNpd2dVNHJ1TG1NdC1TWWhScmVDTkZYVWU0RmIyWmM0V1U0OWd5VVpMTG9BSXRUenYyY1VZNDhmblVaUFU</guid></item><item><title>视频： Golden Retriever Puppy认为吹风机是他的死敌- AOL.com | Video: Golden Retriever Puppy Thinks Hair Dryer Is His Mortal Enemy - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiekFVX3lxTE5TZXBSWldkdmhLOEVTaVp2UlRjSTNlS0U4THl6RzJpeWhNNF9SeHM4QzdmSElBZXoxQS1FdFhoZHJvYWJIdWhMMkZrbnllVXNFRWoxbFFaTGJlTjVQUmM5R284NlVjYlZadGc1a0lvV2QzOGJRSkxHOTJR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;(Photo Credit: @maui_thegoldenpup / Instagram)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To us, a hair dryer is just part of a normal grooming routine.

Many pet parents have witnessed their furry companions react with suspicion or full-on panic to household items. Now, one hilarious &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJ0c3wzp62z/?igsh=MWpoejRxMW1kMzBzeQ==" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; captures a Golden Retriever puppy who is absolutely convinced the hair dryer is a threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Golden Retriever puppy thinks hair dryer is out to get him in funny video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shared by Instagram user @maui_thegoldenpup, the video features a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; puppy named Hugo who is clearly not a fan of post-bath blow drying. The clip begins with Hugo sitting calmly on his owner’s lap as she attempts to dry him off with a hair dryer after a bath. However, within seconds, the calm turns into panic. He starts flinching, then squirms out of her arms and makes a quick getaway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the onscreen text, the owner was caught off guard by Hugo’s reaction. She mentioned that he seemed fine at first, but his discomfort escalated quickly. On a second attempt during another bath, Hugo had the same distressed reaction. Although the hair dryer was set to “no heat” and “low air,” Hugo wanted nothing to do with it. Meanwhile, a towel proved to be a much more acceptable drying method for the sensitive pup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, Hugo’s curiosity occasionally got the better of him, and he would sniff the dryer, only to panic again when switched on. His owner also noted that her two other dogs, Maui and Ruby, had never been bothered by the hair dryer as puppies, making Hugo’s reaction even more unique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your dog is scared of a hair dryer, there are gentler ways to help them dry off. Toweling them thoroughly is a good first step, and some dogs may prefer absorbent microfiber towels designed specifically for pets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If using a dryer is necessary, consider a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/products/175089-corded-vs-cordless-vacuums" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pet-specific model;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pet-specific model&lt;/a&gt; that is quieter and has adjustable heat and speed settings. Always start at a distance, and allow your dog to sniff the device while it is switched off. Gradually desensitizing them with short, low-pressure sessions can also help build comfort over time. Most importantly, be patient and let your dog set the pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/177125-golden-retriever-puppy-hair-dryer-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video: Golden Retriever Puppy Thinks Hair Dryer Is His Mortal Enemy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Video: Golden Retriever Puppy Thinks Hair Dryer Is His Mortal Enemy&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 12:43:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE5TZXBSWldkdmhLOEVTaVp2UlRjSTNlS0U4THl6RzJpeWhNNF9SeHM4QzdmSElBZXoxQS1FdFhoZHJvYWJIdWhMMkZrbnllVXNFRWoxbFFaTGJlTjVQUmM5R284NlVjYlZadGc1a0lvV2QzOGJRSkxHOTJR</guid></item><item><title>不是医生，但可能是结束70 ％癌症死亡的人-这一切都始于一个小实验室-银河日报 | Not a Doctor, But Possibly the Man Who Will End 70% of Cancer Deaths — And It All Started in a Small Lab - The Daily Galaxy</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizgFBVV95cUxOUlFqUWtoY0RRMmRJOV9qMFRwQ25leUYxeHh0dzFjOHRnd2otWWl4Z2pzRnhFQXNfM0lFR0kwR2hPYzJTU21fM3F3VldJM0RhVHJUeGQ4V0xQSjJuc0w2RjhlSUpOM0t1MVJBdnpxcDZzMy0xajhTSmpvUjZ5azQtQVZzcG5IWmdIaHpDMm5KNEVILVpBTjV5enEwUW53NUZlZ3YzTzVoMmkyT3Zwblo0WEVDeHpFeFR6Tm94VHJheXp6T0pSMWJFcjRoZ09zZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a small lab at the heart of the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institut Curie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; in Paris, French chemist &lt;strong&gt;Raphaël Rodriguez&lt;/strong&gt; is working on what could become one of the most significant medical breakthroughs in the fight against &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. While he may have failed his first year of medical school, Rodriguez never abandoned his ambition to save lives. Today, he is leading a team that has discovered a &lt;strong&gt;weakness &lt;/strong&gt;in the biological mechanisms driving &lt;strong&gt;metastasis&lt;/strong&gt;, the process by which cancer spreads through the body—responsible for nearly &lt;strong&gt;70 percent of cancer-related deaths&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Turning the Immune System Against Metastases&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez’s research focuses on a specific group of cells in the &lt;strong&gt;immune system&lt;/strong&gt; known as &lt;strong&gt;macrophages&lt;/strong&gt;. Under normal conditions, these cells help protect the body by attacking harmful invaders. But in the presence of cancer, some macrophages undergo a transformation. &lt;a href="https://institut-curie.org/news/new-class-molecules-against-cancer-cells-refractory-standard-treatments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;According to Rodriguez&lt;/a&gt;, they begin to “adopt a program that helps tumor cells migrate and invade new tissues,” effectively becoming accomplices in the spread of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This transformation is not just behavioral, but &lt;strong&gt;metabolic&lt;/strong&gt;. The team discovered that these &lt;strong&gt;pro-tumor macrophages &lt;/strong&gt;shift their internal processes in a way that supports cancer progression. This insight allowed Rodriguez and his colleagues to design a molecule that can interfere with that specific metabolic switch. By targeting these rogue macrophages, the molecule works to reverse their role in supporting metastasis without damaging other healthy immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

The activation of lysosomal iron by a phospholipid degrader causes the oxidation and rupture of cell membranes, leading to cell death.

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A New Path in Cancer Treatment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez developed this molecule in collaboration with researchers across multiple disciplines, including chemistry, cell biology, and immunology. Preclinical trials using mice have shown that the molecule not only inhibits the macrophages’ transformation but also &lt;strong&gt;slows the development of metastatic tumors&lt;/strong&gt;. This multi-step approach opens a path toward treatments that don’t just fight the primary tumor but stop cancer from spreading altogether.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implications of this work have attracted attention from major pharmaceutical groups and cancer research institutions worldwide. Rodriguez is now preparing for the next stage: bringing this molecule into &lt;strong&gt;clinical testing&lt;/strong&gt;. Although that process is lengthy and complex, his results have already generated significant interest in the scientific community. His work is being closely followed, especially as the fight against metastasis remains one of the most pressing challenges in oncology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From his lab at &lt;em&gt;Institut Curie&lt;/em&gt;, one of Europe’s leading centers for cancer research, Rodriguez continues refining his approach. He works alongside a multidisciplinary team determined to turn the tide on one of cancer’s most elusive and deadly traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

Chicken breast (5th most popular)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 10 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium: 400 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat: 2 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is another lean option, but it can be a bit bland, so bump up the flavor with herbs, mustard or crunchy veggies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Roast Beef (3rd most popular) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 17 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium: 350 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat: 2 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leanest and lowest-sodium choice of the red meat options, it’s a solid pick if you’re craving red meat without going for richer options like capicola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. Honey Ham (2nd most popular) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; 10 g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sodium:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; 570 mg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fat:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; 2.5 g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is still relatively lean, but as the name suggests, honey ham contains 2-3 grams of sugar per serving. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Keep an eye on sodium — check a few different brands and choose the one with the lowest sodium option,” Villaseca advised.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. Pastrami (8th most popular) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 12 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium: 604 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat: 3.3 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pastrami is flavorful and protein-rich, but comes with a bump in fat and sodium.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;6. Corned Beef (4th most popular) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 15 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium: 765 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat: 8 g (including 3 g saturated fat)&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cut from the leaner part of the brisket, corned beef is high in protein, but it’s also one of the saltiest options. It’s b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;est saved for the occasional Reuben.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;7. Capicola (9th most popular)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 10 g &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium: 540 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat: 12 g &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capicola is more of a charcuterie star than a basic sandwich filler. It’s a traditional Italian cured meat (like prosciutto) that’s been dry-cured and aged rather than cooked. Its high fat content and marbling give it a chewy texture and rich flavor, making it the perfect pair for crackers, cheese and other cured meats, rather than as a standard deli slice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;8. Sopressata (least popular)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 12 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium: 960 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat: 14 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If you love it for snack plates, just balance it out with fiber-rich sides like whole grain crackers, fruit, or nuts,” Villaseca recommended. “It’s all about the big picture.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;9. Salami (6th most popular)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 12 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium: 995 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat:18 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;With a long shelf life and being portable, salami is handy for hikes or road trips. Pair with hydrating fruits like oranges or apples if you’re eating it on the go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;10. Bologna (7th most popular) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 7 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium: 750 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat: 16 g &lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bologna is lower in protein and higher in fat and sodium than other options. “It’s often one of the more affordable choices, which is important to acknowledge,” said Farrell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

They find new ways to maintain social relevance — often by doing things older generations don’t understand. (Don’t believe me? Just try to guess what any of their slang terms mean.) One of the latest teen trends is something that might raise a few eyebrows among parents, due to safety and privacy concerns: location tracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although teens crave independence from their parents, they are voluntarily sharing their real-time whereabouts with their friends.

Later, they “checked in” to places on Foursquare and &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/impact/topic/facebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, shared real-time updates on Snapchat and Instagram stories, and tweeted every detail of their lives. Now, they use Snapchat’s Snap Map, Life360, or Apple’s location sharing to share with their friends everywhere they are in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This isn’t new,” Caswell said. “In a world where nearly everything is shared, this doesn’t feel invasive to teens — it feels normal. It’s just another way they stay looped into each other’s lives.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Teens also use apps like this to track their parents, according to Caswell, whose own daughter will text her if she sees her mom is at Ulta and ask for lip gloss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“For many teens, location sharing is about connection and a sense of safety,” Caswell explained. “It’s their way of saying, ‘You’re in my circle’ and ‘I’ve got your back.’” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding The Risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even though sharing your location with friends might be popular, it doesn’t come without consequences. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.evolutiontohealing.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Cheryl Groskopf, " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68222bd5e4b09ed53250130c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.evolutiontohealing.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cheryl Groskopf, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;an anxiety, trauma, and attachment therapist based in Los Angeles, sees teens sharing their locations as a way “to manage anxiety, track social dynamics and feel less alone.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There’s comfort in knowing where your people are, especially in a world where teens constantly feel like they could get left out, replaced or excluded,” she said. “But that comfort is fragile — it relies on constant access (which leaves their nervous system hypervigilant to feeling ‘left out’).”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;“Location sharing can intensify FOMO (fear of missing out) and social exclusion,” said Dr. Cameron Caswell, an adolescent psychologist.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If you’re checking someone’s location because you don’t trust what they’re telling you — or because they don’t trust you — then it’s already crossed into a control dynamic,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Groskopf &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her practice, she’s seen teens “spiral” when they spot their friend at a party they weren’t invited to, or “because someone didn’t respond fast enough, but ‘was clearly at home.’” She explained, “It becomes a setup for overthinking, panic and social surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Teens shouldn’t use location sharing when it’s being used to avoid rejection, manage someone else’s anxiety, or prove loyalty,” she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;McInnis said, “Teens sharing their location and having their friends track them could harm their mental health.” Constantly seeing (and comparing) your friends’ social activities “can lead to feelings of inadequacy,” she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Caswell agreed. “Location sharing can intensify FOMO (fear of missing out) and social exclusion,” she said. “Seeing a group of friends hanging out without them — even unintentionally — can make them feel lonelier and more left out.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to these emotional risks, there are physical risks, too. Like a teen’s location data being available to someone who might wish them harm. “In the wrong hands, it can make [teens] more vulnerable to stalking, harassment or even predatory behavior, especially if they are in controlling relationships,” Caswell said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s A Gender Gap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Teen girls may be more likely to use location sharing as a way to feel safer. According to the Life360 survey, 70% of Gen Z women believe their physical well-being benefits from location sharing. In the field, our experts also found that females were more likely to do this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Caswell said that “mostly girls” will openly share their location with friends, “both for fun and because it makes them feel safer knowing someone always knows where they are.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, this sense of safety is a double-edged sword, as it can “increase the risk of stalking, harassment or even sexual violence,” Caswell said. “Especially when their location is shared with the wrong person, which is often someone they know and trust.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Groskopf warns of the dangers girls and femme teens may experience when their use of location-sharing is weaponized against them. “It can easily turn into emotional surveillance disguised as closeness,” she explained. (For example, a friend or partner telling them, “If you trust me, you’ll let me see where you are.”)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I see these kinds of patterns play out in high-control dynamics — friends or partners checking locations not to stay safe, but to manage anxiety, jealousy or power,” Groskopf said. “And girls are way more likely to internalize that and comply, even when it feels off. They’re more likely to be conditioned to avoid conflict, manage other people’s emotions, and keep the peace — even if that means overriding their own boundaries.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why teaching your kids how to set boundaries, in real life and online, is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setting Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Teaching your teen how to handle location-sharing in a safe way starts with conversations around consent and the ability to say no.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When asked if there is a safe way for teens to share their locations, Groskopf said, “Only if there’s real consent, boundaries, and the freedom to opt out without punishment.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this case, the punishment could be feeling guilt-tripped or rejected by a friend. “That means not just technically having the option to stop sharing, but knowing you won’t be guilted, shut out, or shamed if you do,” Groskopf continued. “A parent saying, ‘I want to know where you are in case of emergency’ is one thing. A friend saying, ‘Why’d you turn off your location?’ with passive-aggressive silence afterward is something else entirely.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She added, “Safe tracking only works when it’s not being weaponized to regulate someone else’s fear, jealousy or insecurity.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Talk To Your Teen About Location Sharing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Start the conversation with curiosity, not criticism, Caswell said. “Instead of banning [location sharing], I recommend walking through privacy settings together and having calm conversations about why they’re sharing in the first place,” she said. “Is it for safety? To feel connected to their bestie? Because they feel pressured to? Helping teens understand why they are doing it makes location sharing a lot safer and more intentional.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;From there, encourage your teen to only share their location with “a small, trusted circle of close friends or family,” and check in on this list frequently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“One mom I worked with told me her daughter was shocked to find an ex-boyfriend still had access to her location,” Caswell said. “Of course, that explained why he kept ‘randomly’ showing up wherever she was. Instead of freaking out, the mom used it as an opportunity to talk with her daughter about how to use tech more safely moving forward.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s always a good idea to talk with your teens about how to stay safe online and set boundaries around privacy with their friends. But keep in mind, this starts at home. “Let your teen say no to you sometimes,” Caswell suggested. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost hidden hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title default-title"&gt;20 Years Of Free Journalism&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-once-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title contributor-canceled-variation"&gt;Your Support Fuels Our Mission&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost__message--control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth. &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/support" class="cli-support-huffpost__message__link js-entry-link" data-vars-item-name="Support our mission" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="main" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="/support" data-vars-target-content-type="feed" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Support our mission&lt;/a&gt; to keep us around for the next 20 — we can't do this without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message variation contributor-once-variation"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We remain committed to providing you with the unflinching, fact-based journalism everyone deserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for your support along the way.

Dental hygienists notice worn teeth, microfractures and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I can see stress in their jaw, whether they clench or grind, thanks to wear facets, chipped teeth or enlarged jaw muscles,” Auger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If You Have A Sleep Disorder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a dental hygienist, there are several signs in the mouth that may indicate sleep-disordered breathing, such as sleep apnea,” Glauz said. “These include a scalloped tongue, enlarged tonsils or uvula, a high, narrow palate, frequent mouth breathing or snoring and signs of tooth grinding, [aka] bruxism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there’s excessive wear on particular surfaces or areas of the teeth, that can reflect certain sleep patterns or issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While a diagnosis must come from a medical provider, these oral indicators can be important clues that prompt further evaluation and help connect patients to the care they need,” Glauz said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If You Smoke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Tobacco use, whether it’s smoking or vaping, shows up in the mouth too,” Ferjuste said. “Staining, gum recession and a higher risk for oral cancer are all red flags we look for.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, drug use can have a noticeable impact on the teeth and mouth. Certain drugs, for instance, can cause dry mouth or become very acidic in the mouth, thus eroding tooth enamel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: bluecinema via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;bluecinema via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Certain lifestyle habits and behaviors have a visible impact on your teeth.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If You’ve Struggled With Acid Reflux Or Bulimia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Patients that have acidic reflux or suffer from bulimia often have signs of erosion,” said &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/kmc.smiles/?hl=en" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Kari Carter-Cherelus" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="681a8654e4b0c2b15d969f84" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/kmc.smiles/?hl=en" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;Kari Carter-Cherelus&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dental hygienist. “Basically, the acid eats the enamel off of the back of their teeth, exposing softer layers of tooth structure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thin enamel can indicate chronic vomiting, acid reflux or frequent consumption of particularly acidic foods and drinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The back surfaces of the upper front teeth is where stomach acid tends to make contact,” Glauz said. “This can lead to teeth that appear smooth, shiny or thinner than normal.

But researchers at the University of Texas at Dallas have shed new light on it by linking it to a little-known nerve structure first described more than a century ago: the Nageotte nodule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;In a study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59538-z" rel=""&gt;published this month&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt;, the team found that dorsal root ganglia — clusters of nerves near the spine that relay sensory signals like pain to the brain — were filled with these nodules in diabetic tissue donors. These microscopic bundles, showing signs of both nerve injury and jumbled regrowth, could offer fresh insight into what drives diabetic peripheral neuropathy and help reframe how scientists study and treat it, said &lt;a href="https://experts.umich.edu/9042-st%C3%A9phanie-eid-phd" rel=""&gt;Stephanie Eid&lt;/a&gt;, a research assistant professor of neurology at the University of Michigan Medical School, who was not involved in the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“We are coming closer to understanding what’s really happening in this disease that has been mysterious so far … and hopefully a step closer to a cure,” Eid said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__YgCAW md_pb-9 md_mb-7 md_pt-9 md_mt-7 pb-6 mb-9 px-9 w-full h-64 bg-blue-light border-t border-b border-gray-light pt-6 mt-9"&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__P1yIN inline-flex col-span-1 row-span-1 pb-4"&gt;&lt;div class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__vRSrF flex-auto w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__3hNhh primaryBold primaryBold-50 mb-3"&gt;Breaking News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dmnc_features-cta-social-cta-social-module__zWZy- mb-4"&gt;Get the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-text-header"&gt;A condition with a significant burden&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-025-02175-1" target="_self" rel="" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-025-02175-1"&gt;High blood sugar, unhealthy fat levels and insulin problems&lt;/a&gt; — all common in diabetes — trigger harmful changes in the body. These changes can damage tiny blood vessels, increase inflammation and stress out the nerves’ energy supply. Over time, that leads to injury and breakdown of the nerves, particularly in the legs and feet, and the protective cells that surround them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="flex items-center flex-col"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 830px, (min-width: 768px) 66.66vw, 100vw" srcset="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/HSC7GJFNGQB2TSWL2CLU3Y7364.jpg?auth=f4137a91262b0ddb0cd44a503952895a6df46f9ee155cfc9505c2a8c5b482f54&amp;amp;width=430&amp;amp;quality=80 430w, https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/HSC7GJFNGQB2TSWL2CLU3Y7364.jpg?auth=f4137a91262b0ddb0cd44a503952895a6df46f9ee155cfc9505c2a8c5b482f54&amp;amp;width=830&amp;amp;quality=80 830w" class="dmnc_images-modern-image-module__QFaG- max-w-full h-auto text-white dmnc_images-modern-image-module__9Zlll bg-gray-light object-contain" src="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/HSC7GJFNGQB2TSWL2CLU3Y7364.jpg?auth=f4137a91262b0ddb0cd44a503952895a6df46f9ee155cfc9505c2a8c5b482f54&amp;amp;width=830&amp;amp;quality=80" alt="Endocrinologist Dr. Howard Baum checks the insulin pump of patient Connie Hedgecoke of..."&gt;&lt;figcaption class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__ku669 secondaryRoman secondaryRoman-10 mt-3 text-gray-medium"&gt;Endocrinologist Dr. Howard Baum checks the insulin pump of patient Connie Hedgecoke of Garland during her quarterly diabetes checkup in his office at Medical City in Dallas.&lt;span class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__7oO0P pl-1"&gt;((File Photo))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;It often takes &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/diabetes/diabetic-neuropathy-nerve-problems" rel=""&gt;at least a decade&lt;/a&gt; after a diabetes diagnosis for noticeable symptoms to appear. These can include numbness, tingling pain and weakness. In more severe cases, particularly when high blood sugar is poorly controlled, complications can escalate to foot ulcers or even amputations of the lower limbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Diabetic peripheral neuropathy can also interfere with the body’s sense of proprioception — its unconscious ability to detect where its limbs are — which increases a diabetic’s risk of falls and injuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“It’s very common for people when they start to get diabetic neuropathy, that one of the first things that happens is problems with proprioception or balance,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.utdallas.edu/theodore.price" rel=""&gt;Ted Price&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of neuroscience at UTD and director of its Center for Advanced Pain Studies, who led the study. “Then they also tend to lose the sense of touch at the bottoms of their feet, and then sometime after that, they start to get pain.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-text-header"&gt;A century-old discovery sees new light &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Price didn’t have diabetic peripheral neuropathy in mind when he and his colleagues began their research into the dorsal root ganglion in March 2020. At the time, they had launched a collaboration with the &lt;a href="https://www.organ.org/" rel=""&gt;Southwest Transplant Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, a Dallas-based nonprofit, to build a nerve tissue bank.

(Ben Torres/Special Contributor)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;While examining donor dorsal root ganglia in 2022, UTD researcher Stephanie Shiers kept noticing a curious structure: microscopic balls of dead sensory neurons ringed by satellite glial cells, a type of non-neuronal cell that supports neurons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“When I started seeing these popping up, I went to the literature to try to figure out what they were,” said Shiers, who is the study’s first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;She eventually found papers describing similar structures in &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13365-017-0529-9" target="_self" rel="" title="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13365-017-0529-9"&gt;rhesus macaques with simian immunodeficiency virus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1699-0463.1999.tb01558.x" target="_self" rel="" title="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1699-0463.1999.tb01558.x"&gt;in rats intoxicated with mercury&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnen/article-abstract/60/5/493/2916342" target="_self" rel="" title="https://academic.oup.com/jnen/article-abstract/60/5/493/2916342"&gt;in humans&lt;/a&gt; with a variety of neurological and neurodegenerative conditions. These structures were identified as Nageotte nodules, named for the French anatomist Jean Nageotte, who first described the formations in 1922 while grafting bundles of nerves from rabbit to rabbit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Shiers then combed through the donors’ medical records to look for patterns. One striking throughline emerged from samples of 90 dorsal root ganglia examined: Nageotte nodules were more common in the subset of tissue donors who had diabetes. Diabetics who appeared to have diabetic peripheral neuropathy, based on symptoms noted in their records, had more Nageotte nodules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Curious about what these nodules were made of, Shiers and her colleagues decided to investigate them at a molecular level with spatial sequencing, which shows which genes are active and where. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The researchers found Nageotte nodules had both satellite glial cells and non-myelinating Schwann cells, another non-neuronal support cell. Together the two cell types seemed to be stepping in after nerve damage, clustering around the long-gone dead sensory neurons.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 830px, (min-width: 768px) 66.66vw, 100vw" srcset="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/OMHQDZGJPFBU5K37ZX3TLHT7IQ.jpg?auth=7b03b8dc9220bbbdbc8c6324aea351f5969dfec0f89a20aaa2a33e1025f1edaa&amp;amp;width=430&amp;amp;quality=80 430w, https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/OMHQDZGJPFBU5K37ZX3TLHT7IQ.jpg?auth=7b03b8dc9220bbbdbc8c6324aea351f5969dfec0f89a20aaa2a33e1025f1edaa&amp;amp;width=830&amp;amp;quality=80 830w" class="dmnc_images-modern-image-module__QFaG- max-w-full h-auto text-white dmnc_images-modern-image-module__9Zlll bg-gray-light object-contain" src="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/OMHQDZGJPFBU5K37ZX3TLHT7IQ.jpg?auth=7b03b8dc9220bbbdbc8c6324aea351f5969dfec0f89a20aaa2a33e1025f1edaa&amp;amp;width=830&amp;amp;quality=80" alt="Stephanie Shiers is a research scientist at the University of Texas at Dallas, where she..."&gt;&lt;figcaption class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__ku669 secondaryRoman secondaryRoman-10 mt-3 text-gray-medium"&gt;Stephanie Shiers is a research scientist at the University of Texas at Dallas, where she completed her PhD in cognition and neuroscience in 2019.&lt;span class="dmnc_images-image-elements-module__7oO0P pl-1"&gt;(University of Texas at Dallas)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Threaded through the nodules were axons, or long wirelike projections of nerve cells that transmit electrical signals from the body’s extremities to the brain, much like data traveling through an ethernet cable. In diabetic peripheral neuropathy, loss of these axons is thought to cause much of the pain, numbness and tingling that diabetics experience.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Inside the Nageotte nodules, Shiers and her colleagues saw the axons were trying to regrow but in a disorganized fashion — more like frayed electrical wires than a clean repair. This kind of jumbled regrowth is called a neuroma, said Price, and is commonly seen in people who have had a limb amputated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-text-header"&gt;The hunt for treatments&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Shiers’ chance discovery of Nageotte nodules and their link to diabetic peripheral neuropathy is the first step in research she and Price aim to conduct to better understand the condition and develop more effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;One major question they want to explore&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;is whether the axons inside Nageotte nodules within the dorsal root ganglion are electrically active and, if so, whether they’re sending pain signals to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Some studies have found that electrically stimulating the dorsal root ganglion may be effective for managing chronic pain conditions &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/sharing-mayo-clinic-neurostimulation-stops-pain-signals-in-their-tracks/" rel=""&gt;like complex regional pain syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. But whether it will work for diabetic peripheral neuropathy requires further research.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;By studying the chemicals released by the different cells inside a Nageotte nodule, Price said, it might be possible to identify targets for drugs that stop whatever is causing pain signaling, whether it’s inflammation or some other process causing damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“Those cells that form the nodule, they seem to be pathological in some way,” Price said. “I think maybe they could be a source of what’s called reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species [that] we know are involved in diabetes and diabetic neuropathy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“My guess is that those pathological cells could be changed in some way with a therapeutic to not produce reactive oxygen or reactive nitrogen species and that could probably alleviate some of the pain-related symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1300px) 830px, (min-width: 768px) 66.66vw, 100vw" srcset="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/LJ5DYRSZBFVKLIARCI6NYKE354.jpg?auth=75b254e5d0485517b5e91eeddf80a8424ecfd56933212c110dacbd1eb166bdda&amp;amp;width=430&amp;amp;quality=80 430w, https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/LJ5DYRSZBFVKLIARCI6NYKE354.jpg?auth=75b254e5d0485517b5e91eeddf80a8424ecfd56933212c110dacbd1eb166bdda&amp;amp;width=830&amp;amp;quality=80 830w" class="dmnc_images-modern-image-module__QFaG- max-w-full h-auto text-white dmnc_images-modern-image-module__9Zlll bg-gray-light object-contain" src="https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/LJ5DYRSZBFVKLIARCI6NYKE354.jpg?auth=75b254e5d0485517b5e91eeddf80a8424ecfd56933212c110dacbd1eb166bdda&amp;amp;width=830&amp;amp;quality=80" alt="The injectable drug Ozempic is shown, July 1, 2023, in Houston.

Phillip / AP)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Right now, the only ways to address diabetic peripheral neuropathy are to prevent diabetes in the first place or to manage it carefully once diagnosed, said Eid of the University of Michigan Medical School. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“The American Diabetes Association recommends diet and exercise to reduce nerve damage in patients with neuropathy or patients who have prediabetes, but they may be unwilling or unable to do it,” Eid said. “Compliance is a real issue. Sometimes it could be a comorbidity like if they have cardiac problems or it could be they have mental issues — depression is very common in patients with diabetic neuropathy. Sometimes it’s just that they’re unmotivated, they don‘t want to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Finding a treatment that people with diabetes can stick with is crucial. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/php/data-research/index.html" rel=""&gt;About 38 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; — nearly 12% of the U.S. population — have diabetes, a number &lt;a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/pop.2015.0181" rel=""&gt;expected to climb&lt;/a&gt; past 55 million by 2030. Total annual medical and societal costs tied to the disease are also projected to rise by 53%, topping $622 billion by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Shiers hopes the study will steer preclinical research toward understanding how Nageotte nodules shape the dorsal root ganglion‘s role in chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;“The preclinical pain field isn’t aware of [Nageotte nodules] because they haven‘t shown up in our animal models and nobody has reported on them,” Shiers said. “We hope these data sets can be used to really guide preclinical studies and so some of these questions [about pain] can start being answered.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Miriam Fauzia is a science reporting fellow at The Dallas Morning News.
