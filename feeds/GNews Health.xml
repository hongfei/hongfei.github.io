              &lt;p&gt;Is there anything that Ozempic and drugs like it &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt; do? A study out today finds that GLP-1 medications often raise men’s testosterone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists in St. Louis, Missouri, led the research, which studied men taking one of several GLP-1 drugs for their type 2 diabetes or obesity. On average, men’s testosterone rose significantly after they started taking a GLP-1, with many reaching normal levels. The findings suggest these weight loss drugs can also have reproductive health benefits for men, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Testosterone is important to both men’s and women’s health, but it’s especially vital to the former. In men, it helps maintain muscle mass, bone density, and fertility, to name a few functions. People who develop type 2 diabetes or obesity often experience declining T levels. Conversely, people who lose weight or get their blood sugar under control tend to &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/advance-article/doi/10.1210/clinem/dgaf137/8058933"&gt;regain&lt;/a&gt; this lost testosterone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the study authors, however, there isn’t much research looking into what happens to men and their testosterone once they start taking GLP-1s like semaglutide (the active ingredient in the diabetes drug Ozempic and the obesity drug Wegovy). And they wanted to better understand the broader health benefits of these medications beyond weight loss alone.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team analyzed over 200 men with type 2 diabetes or obesity who were prescribed a GLP-1 (semaglutide, tirzepatide, or the older GLP-1 dulaglutide) and who were not taking added testosterone or other hormones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The men’s blood sugar control and weight improved, as expected, with an average weight loss of 10%—and so did their testosterone. Men’s average total and free testosterone levels rose noticeably from their baseline. Only 53% of men had normal T levels before GLP-1 treatments; afterward, the same was true for 77% of men. The team’s findings were presented Monday at the Endocrine Society’s annual meeting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The T-boosting effects of GLP-1 therapy didn’t seem quite as large as those seen with other weight loss treatments, particularly surgery. These drugs offer their own advantages, though, according to lead study researcher Shellsea Portillo Canales.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“It’s less dramatic than the rise seen after bariatric surgery, which typically causes rapid and substantial hormonal shifts,” Portillo Canales, an endocrinology fellow at SSM Health St. Louis University Hospital, told Gizmodo. “However, the benefit of GLP-1s is that they are non-invasive, more accessible, and can help improve testosterone naturally, especially when combined with sustained weight loss.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The improvement in men’s testosterone levels correlated well with how many pounds they shed, suggesting that weight loss is the primary driver of this effect. But Portillo Canales doesn’t rule out that other factors, like improved insulin resistance and lower inflammation, could matter, too.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The researchers would like to further confirm this link through prospective studies that proactively track men and their testosterone levels once on GLP-1 therapy. But given that these patients are already taking these drugs for their diabetes or obesity, the potential boost in testosterone could be seen as a nifty bonus at the very least. Just be careful, though. Portillo Canales notes that if men stop taking a GLP-1 and start to gain back weight, their testosterone levels might sink back down along with it.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;At 32, Wendy Maultsby was working full-time and planning out
her dream future: meeting her future husband, getting married, and giving birth
to her first child.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;But what awaited Maultsby was a diagnosis she never anticipated—and
certainly not in her 30s. If she ever imagined it, she thought it would come
when she was a grandmother in her 70s. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Around February 2022, I started what I thought was a
regular menstrual cycle,” the now 35-year-old recalled. “Everything seemed
normal, but things seemed strange when it started getting heavier than usual.
It lasted for about two-and-a-half months.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Maultsby shared her symptoms were relentless and resulted in
multiple trips to urgent care. She was given medication that would offer temporary
relief, but the bleeding continued. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“It got to the point where one day I just felt so weak. I
was in my office at work and I was so weak I couldn’t even walk to my car,” she
said. “I knew something was wrong. My heart was beating incredibly fast. I got
home, I went straight to bed, and I thought, ‘I’ll just sleep it off. Maybe I’m
just tired or stressed.’”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;When she didn’t feel better the next morning, Maultsby said
her gut told her she needed to go to the emergency room. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“I got to the ER, and they put me back into the room almost
immediately. It turned out I had lost so much blood that I required a blood
transfusion,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Her extreme blood loss was putting additional stress on her
heart and causing it to pump harder than usual to circulate what little blood
she had left. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;An emergency gynecological visit to Johnston Memorial
Hospital in Smithfield caused the Johnston County resident to be scheduled for
a biopsy. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Maultsby told WRAL, “The doctor was like, ‘It’s super highly
unlikely this is it, but I just want to cross all of my Ts.’ I almost canceled that
appointment because the schedule of birth control that she had given me did
stop the bleeding. I was like ‘Oh, I’m fine. I’m cured.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Maultsby still remembers the Friday morning, just a few days
after her biopsy, when she got the call that changed her life.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“He said, ‘I’m so sorry, but you do have cancer.’ I was in
complete shock,” she said. “The first thing I thought about was, ‘Am I going to
die?’”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;She was diagnosed with grade 1 endometrial cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The average age of diagnosis for endometrial cancer is 60,
according to the American Cancer Society, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/endometrial-cancer/about/key-statistics.html"&gt;with diagnoses under 45 being uncommon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Maultsby said she was told her prognosis was good and she
would likely live a long life because the cancer was caught early. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;But her dream of getting pregnant was suddenly in jeopardy. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“My biggest fear was that my fertility would be affected,”
she said. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Maultsby continued, “My options were basically to have a hysterectomy,
or have hormone treatment. I opted to do hormone treatment so that I would have
the possibility of motherhood.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Three years later, Maultsby is celebrating five months of
marriage. She shared she and her husband are continuing to weigh all their
options of becoming parents. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We’re still going to try to become parents the natural way,
but if that doesn’t work out then we plan to adopt,” said Maultsby. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Dr. Angeles Alvarez Secord with the Duke Cancer Center is one
of the physicians who has been treating Maultsby. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The gynecologic oncologist shared cases like Maultsby’s are
becoming more common as the cancer affects a greater number of young adults. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;WRAL investigated the rise in younger cancer cases in our
recent documentary &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/story/diagnosis-young-the-new-face-of-cancer-in-nc/22052931/"&gt;Diagnosis:
Young, The New Face of Cancer in NC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“This disease
continues to rise in the United States,” shared Alvarez
Secord. “It's anticipated that about 70,000 women will have a diagnosis of
uterine cancer this year, and almost 14,000 women will die.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The physician stated education is vital to reducing the grim
statistic, particularly among at-risk demographics. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Individuals who identify as Black are at a twofold
increased risk of death,” she added. “We’re seeing an aggressive rise in
cancers in women under the age of 50. These issues in totality, they cannot be
ignored.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Alvarez Secord said abnormal bleeding is the most common symptom
patients will present with, regardless of age. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“If somebody is postmenopausal and they’ve stopped having
their periods and have any bleeding at all, even just a red dab, that is a huge
warning sign,” the doctor advised. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;She continued, “If it’s before menopause, it can be
harder. What you’re looking for is, is there an increase in that bleeding
pattern or are they having bleeding between their periods, or any sort of abnormal
bleeding.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;She noted that bleeding after sexual intercourse is
another sign someone should seek medical attention. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Alvarez Secord said in addition to a biopsy, a patient may
have a pelvic ultrasound to help reach a diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The physician noted clinicians also need to be more aware
of the growing impact cancer is having on younger demographics to prevent
symptoms from being misdiagnosed or missed entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Often they will think it’s their period, and it’s not
just them that think that, it could be their healthcare providers as well,”
said Alvarez Secord. “For the care providers that are on the front lines, it’s having
that little ‘red flag’ in the back of your head that somebody complains their
cycles are increasing, or becoming abnormal, or bleeding between periods or
after sex—that needs to trigger some sort of evaluation.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Maultsby added more open conversations among those with
diagnoses like herself could help reduce stigma, and aid in earlier
intervention. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“It was almost embarrassing to talk about at first,”
Maultsby added. “I wanted nobody to know because I felt like I had an elderly
person’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Maultsby told WRAL she often questioned, “What did I do
wrong?” after being diagnosed at such a young age. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Knowing it is an epidemic, makes me want to share my story
because I know a lot more people are going to be diagnosed in the coming years,”
she said. “They need to know they’re not alone, and it’s not your fault. This
is something that is ongoing and it is happening. Research has come so far, but
we need more of it, and we just need to advocate for each other and ourselves
in this fight against cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Alvarez Secord further underscored the call for more
research, adding, “We need to do something. It's a serious call for action.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The oncologist noted recent NIH cuts impacting medical
research nationwide, &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/news/local/unc-chapel-hill-126m-federal-grant-cuts-june-2025/"&gt;including
cancer research in the Triangle&lt;/a&gt;, is cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“It is very hard for OBGYNs to
compete at that level,” Alvarez Secord said. “I think probably in terms of NH
dollars, OBGYNs represent about 1% of that. When you cut funding even further,
I'm worried that we're going to lose a generation of researchers who are going
to have a calling to do this work specifically for cancers that affect women.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;When asked what she thought might contribute to the rise in
young cancer diagnoses, Alvarez Secord called attention to the food supply.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“I think there's a lot of
potential linkages between food, not just highly processed, but different types
of food that we eat. We've gone from an environment where you used to eat food that
came out of your own garden, to an environment where now everything's bought at
the grocery store. And, a lot of people don't even eat raw vegetables and
fruits,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-fertility-awareness-july-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Maultsby said one of her biggest
pieces of advice for other young adults is to prioritize their health. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“People need to empower themselves,
especially with learning their own family history and their own personal risk,”
she said. “Remember your health is so precious. Being so young, it is easy to
take health for granted.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;She continued, “When I was younger,
I wish I had limited alcohol more. I wish I had been more physically active, and
consumed less processed foods, and slept better. I definitely didn’t take as
great care of myself as I do today. It’s only because once you lose your health
it becomes the most precious thing to you.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
					
				&lt;/div&gt;

A doctor who researches the link between the disease and our gut microbes has a theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't want to give the message that microbes are the entire thing. But we know that there are significant correlations between how much we have of various microbes and cancer," Dr. Neelendu Dey, an associate professor at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trillions of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gut-health-boost-overall-digestion-better-moods-2024-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;microbes live in our colon lining&lt;/a&gt;, and research suggests the more diverse they are the better our health and the lower our chances of developing diseases including colon and other forms of cancer, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we eat and our environment affect the make-up of what's known as the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-gut-health-microbiome-trend-2025-3" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, ultra-processed foods and being sedentary are thought to harm it.&lt;/p&gt;
                  
                &lt;p&gt;Dey's lab researches how microbes could be used to prevent and treat colon cancer, but everyone's gut microbiome is unique, he said. By understanding how individual microboes respond to different ingredients, they hope to provide personalized dietary recommendations to prevent &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-symptoms-young-people-misdiagnosed-hemorrhoids-women-worldclass-2025-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;precancerous polyps&lt;/a&gt; from forming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dey is 45, the age the American Cancer Society recommends those with an average risk of colon cancer &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-symptoms-in-my-30s-colonoscopy-cost-insurance-2025-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;start getting colonoscopies every 10 years&lt;/a&gt;. To lower his colon&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;cancer risk, first and foremost, Dey said he follows official advice to get screened. Those at higher risk, for example, with a genetic predisposition, can talk to their doctor to decide if earlier screening is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dey also makes diet and lifestyle choices to look after his gut microbiome, in the hopes of reducing his &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-risks-young-people-reduce-diet-alcohol-2024-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;colon cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;"The microbiome, I believe, is a long-term player in improving our health," he said.

Fiber is found in plant foods such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans, and oats, and it feeds the "good" bacteria in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2018 study based on &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.00031-18#sec-2" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;The American Gut Project &lt;/a&gt;analyzed the stool samples and eating habits of 10,000 people, and found that those who ate &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/eating-30-plants-a-week-gut-health-easier-2024-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;30 types of plant foods a week&lt;/a&gt; had more diverse microbiomes than those who ate 10 or fewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being of South Asian descent, Dey often makes Indian dishes, many of which contain lentils, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/chickpea-recipes-to-lower-cholesterol-science-backed-advice-2025-7" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;chickpeas&lt;/a&gt;, and spices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Good" microbes don't all eat the same type of fiber.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Those who ate eggs once-a-week or two-or-more-times-per-week groups had about half the risk of developing Alzheimer's dementia compared to those who consumed eggs less than once a month&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;These brain samples allowed the scientists to assess whether egg intake was related to the presence of dementia-related markers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It remains unclear if all the deceased participants were suffering from dementia prior to their death. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed that people who ate eggs at least once a week had a lower rate of clinical Alzheimer's diagnosis than those who ate them rarely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specifically, those who ate eggs once-a-week or two-or-more-times-per-week groups had about half the risk of developing Alzheimer's dementia compared to those who consumed eggs less than once a month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants who ate eggs more frequently also had significantly higher average choline levels over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While this observational study did not expand on how choline can decrease the risk of Alzheimer's disease by up to 40 percent, the scientists theorized that it's overall protective effect may play a critical role in protecting brain cells from damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Choline is a nutrient essential for producing acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that maintains the brain's memory and learning capacity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also plays a significant role in maintaining and protecting the structure of cell membranes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous studies have shown that low choline levels in the blood are associated with increased levels of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain - both of which are the main culprits in the development of the Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Alzheimer's Association warns that by 2050, nearly 13 million Americans may be affected&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The plaques and tangles form when amyloid proteins misfold and stick together, forming sticky clumps (plaques) and when tau proteins twist and get tied up (tangles). These toxic buildups block brain cells, or neurons, from sending signals properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, this can impair brain functioning and lead to memory and muscle decline. If it persists, this disruption can cause permanent damage in the brain that leads to Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;As the disease progresses, patients may lose the ability to speak, care for themselves or even respond to the world around them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers believe that regularly consuming eggs can maintain choline levels in the body, which in turn can help maintain brain cell health and prevent the formation of amyloid plaques and tau tangles.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even though the liver produces choline in small amounts, experts say that it is necessary to consume food items such as egg yolks, fish, soybeans and legumes to maintain the required levels of the nutrient in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the National Institute of Health, adult women (above the age of 19) need to consume about 425 milligrams of choline per day while adult men need to consume 550 mg of the nutrient every day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One large hard boiled egg has about 147 mg of choline while half a cup of roasted soybeans contain about 107 mg of the nutrient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the other hand, three ounces of pan-fried beef liver contains about 356 mg of choline while three ounces of cooked fresh cod merely has 71 mg of the nutrient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 16:48:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxQekVIUGVyS2V5anlNRGtqWkhPRno3WF9fNzhFNUlVMkdIQXFUNjZQbzlJWHRJWkFZaHhQUm1ydTV5cndvejNPQzVRX2tGdXAxcmNaSGpUclhiM1VHeHRjWDdqYmhYb3B4cWx6UFhoRlhuVm9sYXV4Z0loUk8tWnE4aEt2aGFVV0gtSHlSMGdjREdNSHJxX1N3cFBB</guid></item><item><title>更年期： 4个因素可能对长期心脏健康至关重要-今日医学新闻 | Menopause: 4 factors may be essential for long-term heart health - Medical News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPekdaYlhrajZkTGtMeE5SRUhZT1lrcTdfQWx2NlduVXRrTUNYeUJackVCNHFHR1lLa3RuNHVybkl1cWx6VF8wVElaSUQ2TW9OdGVwWTNTYjFDY2ZUVWpqdFhhYjZ3dnhTVk1XT2VoaU81VlptRVU3b0FTNGtSb2tybmxSVll2V01pMlJxckhRV3FfSXhSYWw1UjRwWjZIRVNFNUJ5RnhNYVNPY29MQWNFSzBveno1NkNqQUZR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-yhe8zq"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/07/sleep-menopause-Stocksy_txp54e39349MJ9400_Medium_2692626-Header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/07/sleep-menopause-Stocksy_txp54e39349MJ9400_Medium_2692626-Header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/07/sleep-menopause-Stocksy_txp54e39349MJ9400_Medium_2692626-Header-1024x575.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/07/sleep-menopause-Stocksy_txp54e39349MJ9400_Medium_2692626-Header-1024x575.jpg" alt="A woman sleeps on a sofa on her stomach" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="icon-hl-pinterest css-11oz8gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalnewstoday.com%2Farticles%2F4-habits-sleep-not-smoking-may-help-lower-heart-disease-risk-during-menopause&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F07%2Fsleep-menopause-Stocksy_txp54e39349MJ9400_Medium_2692626-Header-1024x575.jpg&amp;amp;description=Menopause%3A%204%20factors%20may%20be%20essential%20for%20long-term%20heart%20health" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/07/sleep-menopause-Stocksy_txp54e39349MJ9400_Medium_2692626-Header-1024x575.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-13b3g0x"&gt;Researchers have discovered that better sleep, among many other habits, may be essential for good heart health in menopause.

The LE8 includes eight specific health behaviors and factors to help determine a person’s heart health:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be more active&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Control cholesterol&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eat better&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get healthy sleep&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage blood pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage blood sugar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage weight&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quit tobacco&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The eight components identified by the American Heart Association as being linked to cardiovascular disease risk are already well established,” El Khoudary explained. “What remains unclear, however, is how well women in midlife are doing in relation to these components.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6784846/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;previous work&lt;/a&gt; has revealed that the menopause transition is really a critical turning point, a time when women experience changes in many components of Life’s Essential 8,” she continued. “So, women really need to work to counteract all of those changes in midlife to protect their cardiovascular health in the ensuing years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the study, El Khoudary and her team found that four LE8 components — managing blood sugar and blood pressure, sleep quality, and nicotine use — were the main factors driving study participants’ future heart disease risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This finding is important because it highlights key areas … that may have the greatest impact on future heart health for women,” El Khoudary explained. “However, our study did not test whether targeting these specifically leads to better outcomes than focusing on other factors. This is an important question for future clinical trials to explore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also discovered that only one in five menopausal women have an ideal LE8 score. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we compare this to the general population, the prevalence is very close,” El Khoudary said. “There’s very low prevalence of optimal LE8 scores. Unfortunately, many people still need to do more, including women who are in this vulnerable stage, the menopause transition. Of course, that’s easier said than done! There are many barriers to living up to Life’s Essential 8. And there is also a lack of awareness. We need to continue to work to address both of those challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Next, we need to understand why many midlife women struggle to maintain ideal heart health and what barriers they face.

The Northeast was the hardest-hit region, according to the CDC.

The CDC received more than 89,000 reports of Lyme disease in 2023,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;but on its website, it also says “estimates using other methods suggest that approximately 476,000 people may be diagnosed and treated for Lyme disease each year in the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EXAQFZ7LOVFR3KZ2O34OIPEOGE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;This year, as of July 8,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;the D.C.

The Virginia Department of Health has reported 297 “confirmed or probable” tick-borne illnesses, of which 248 are Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NF6E6NGAVVHJFKGNWFPPRVVK5Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Ticks are also responsible for babesiosis, a malaria-like disease characterized by fever-like symptoms, and alpha-gal syndrome, a disease that causes an allergy to red meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="CTENPRY35RF7BE3KXD5KZMQZJQ" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="CTENPRY35RF7BE3KXD5KZMQZJQ" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Why you might be seeing more ticks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7EULQKZGRFDFVHK6YVX7GA6BKQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;One reason behind the increase in ticks is climate change. The area’s longer warm periods and milder winters create conditions that make it easier for ticks to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MHGJLIZAC5DSRHJMHWSXU7T6QM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Climate change is also responsible for the influx of the lone star tick, which was previously found only in the southern United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BK32N5DJ6BFAXMUT42C7PBAU4M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Another factor is the population of animals, like deer and white-footed mice, that ticks latch onto. A lack of large predators and hunting restrictions, combined with an abundance in food, allow these animal populations to thrive. Years where oak trees produce a large amount of acorns are called mast years. The year after mast years is when tick populations can thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PQKPLKIDIBE7DBLFTH4CP23VEY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Then we would expect to see greater transmission, because we now have higher populations of infected mice, infected ticks, and a greater ability to transmit, a greater probability that the tick will carry the Lyme disease and give it to a human,” Raupp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="G554JH2QYFHSXD6B234SIXAILE" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="G554JH2QYFHSXD6B234SIXAILE" data-testid="article-header"&gt;What to do when you find a tick&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NPJCYQLXA5A3BMNO6SLAJHS6VA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When you spot a tick making a meal of you, the standard protocol is to grasp it&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;with forceps as close to the skin as possible and remove it. Instinct may lead a person to throw it away or squish it. But entomologists actually want you to do something else: collect the tick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SZFXCDSNJNEKHJMTDHLFSJFWGA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Virginia’s Department of Health has the Citizen Tick Survey, which asks users to submit either a photo or the tick itself and answer a few questions.

That means any new outbreaks during that time must come from people who contracted the virus from outside, not inside, the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) is considered the best defense in stopping measles outbreaks. Unfortunately vaccine rates have been dropping in recent years.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Houston Chronicle/Hearst Newspapers via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Houston Chronicle/Hearst Newspapers via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under that criteria, the U.S. has until January to eliminate the nation’s current outbreaks, which is a year after cases started domestically in Texas, according to epidemiology experts. If it doesn’t, the U.S.’s measles elimination status could be taken away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It could be more impactful than a lot of Americans think about since we have had measles elimination status for so long,” Brittany Kmush, associate professor and graduate director of Syracuse University’s Public Health Department, told HuffPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It could affect U.S. citizens’ ability to travel to specific countries if they don’t want the risk of measles getting introduced to their country. It could affect other people’s ability to come visit the U.S. Other countries might require proof of measles vaccination before they can reenter their home country,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There could also be increased quarantine and isolation requirements, with potential economic fallout, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of this, many more people could be at risk of contracting the virus, which is considered one of the most contagious in the world. If just one person has it, up to 9 out of 10 people nearby will become infected if they are not vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“It’s just a matter of if and when an infectious individual enters one of those communities and kind of invites an outbreak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__attribution caption-cli"&gt;- William Moss, executive director of Johns Hopkins’ International Vaccine Access Center&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not just a cold for a lot of people. It can lead to phenomena and in rare cases encephalitis and death,” said Kmush. Children younger than 5 years of age are especially vulnerable to severe illness and health complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, there’s still time this year to fight outbreaks. Losing the elimination status is also purposely made challenging because, unless the virus is globally eradicated ― a feat only seen with smallpox ― there’s always going to be cases brought into the U.S. from outside, said William Moss, executive director of Johns Hopkins’ International Vaccine Access Center, who co-leads the school’s measles tracking project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As long as there’s measles virus circulating somewhere in the world, there’s always going to be these importations,” he told HuffPost.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“It would be very hard to maintain measles elimination status if every time someone brought it in and there was another case, you would lose it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not outbreaks will stop before the deadline remains uncertain, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles cases in the U.S. have been dropping since their peak in March, giving hope that outbreaks may be petering out. But vaccination rates remain at their lowest in years in the U.S., reducing &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="so-called “herd immunity”" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="687148e4e4b07da2c0819b46" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;so-called “herd immunity”&lt;/a&gt; and opening the door for new outbreaks to ignite in communities that have low vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Measles cases have been dropping this year since hitting a peak in March.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s just a matter of if and when an infectious individual enters one of those communities and kind of invites an outbreak,” said Moss, while comparing the chances to a hot ember drifting from a wildfire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If it lands in a wet area, you’re not going to have an outbreak if there’s high vaccine coverage. But if it enters an area with really low vaccine coverage, you could have another really large outbreak,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With less than six months left in the year, Moss says it’s still too early to start a countdown or “really sweat about this.” He also said that even if elimination status is lost, cases are at least unlikely to return to the levels seen in the early 1990s, since vaccine levels do remain reasonably high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kmush, however, expressed more caution on the chances of elimination being a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am definitely alarmed,” she said, while pointing out that the U.S. nearly lost its elimination status in 2019 when there were fewer cases than those seen this year. She credited a rise in vaccine coverage and public health advocacy toward the end of that year for sparing the U.S. from losing its status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were able to get them vaccinated and do the quarantine and isolation,” she said of vulnerable communities. “Unfortunately, measles vaccination rates are even lower now than they were in 2019 and 99% of the cases that have been reported in this outbreak are either not vaccinated or have unknown vaccination status.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Measles cases are unlikely to rise to the levels seen 35 years ago, thanks to high vaccine rates. There were 17,914 cases in 1989 and 27,808 cases in 1990, according to the CDC.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and Moss both also stressed that the U.S. getting its elimination status back after losing it is also no easy feat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A country would have to show zero continuous transmission of the virus domestically for 36 months, as well as demonstrate a good virus surveillance system, which Moss said the U.S. does have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As far as what can be done now, Kmush said more people need to get vaccinated, calling it “the greatest tool” in decreasing cases and protecting those who are unable to get vaccinated, such as babies younger than six months of age or people who are immunocompromised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You can do quarantine, isolation, similar to the idea with COVID, but measles is a lot more contagious than COVID,” she said. “And so we really need everyone who is eligible to get the vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also stressed that federal health officials need to do more to reduce vaccine hesitancy and skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think certain administrators and their views on vaccines have been fueling some of this vaccine hesitancy and people’s reluctance to receive a vaccine that’s been proven safe and effective for decades,” she said. “The policies and some of the vaccine hesitancy and skepticism rhetoric is definitely dangerous and going to make people who are unsure about vaccines even more unsure, when they really shouldn’t be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;HHS Secretary Robert F.

Among those with ADHD, women showed more activity in several of these regions than men, pointing to possible sex-related differences in how the brain processes decisions that involve uncertainty. The research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.70215" target="_blank"&gt;Brain and Behavior&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is typically thought of as a childhood condition, but it often continues into adulthood. Many adults with ADHD struggle with impulsivity, emotional regulation, and decision-making. These difficulties can translate into behaviors that put them at greater risk, such as reckless driving, unsafe sex, substance use, or gambling. While previous studies have explored how people with ADHD respond to the outcomes of decisions, less is known about what happens in the brain before a decision is made—especially in emotionally charged or intuitive situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand this anticipatory phase, the researchers focused on the role of unconscious and emotional processes that guide decision-making. They were particularly interested in how bodily sensations—like a quickened heartbeat or a gut feeling—might influence behavior in people with ADHD. This idea is grounded in the “somatic marker hypothesis,” which proposes that the body’s physical response to emotionally relevant information plays a role in guiding choices. The study also aimed to explore whether men and women with ADHD might show different patterns of brain activity in this context, given known sex differences in how the disorder presents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team recruited 38 adults, including 18 with ADHD (10 women and 8 men) and 20 without the disorder (10 women and 10 men). Participants were screened to ensure they met diagnostic criteria and did not have other major psychiatric or neurological conditions. Most of the participants with ADHD had been taking stimulant medication but were asked to pause use 24 hours before the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant completed a task known as the Balloon Analogue Risk Task, or BART, while undergoing brain imaging in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. The task involved watching a virtual balloon inflate on a screen and deciding when to stop it before it popped. The longer they waited, the more points they could earn—but if the balloon burst before they stopped it, they would lose all the points for that round. This version of the task was designed to encourage fast, intuitive decisions rather than deliberate calculation. Reaction time—the delay between the start of the balloon inflation and when the participant pressed the stop button—was used as a behavioral measure of risk-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While participants completed the task, researchers measured activity in their brains during the anticipation phase of each decision, before they acted. This allowed the team to examine what parts of the brain were engaged in preparing for the risky choice. They also compared results by group (ADHD vs. non-ADHD) and by sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of behavior, participants with and without ADHD showed similar reaction times on average, suggesting that the groups did not differ in observable risk-taking behavior. However, the brain imaging data told a different story. Individuals with ADHD showed significantly lower activation in two specific brain areas: the right precuneus and the right superior frontal gyrus. These areas are thought to play important roles in self-awareness, internal monitoring, and integrating emotional information—functions that are often disrupted in people with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The precuneus is involved in tasks that require self-reflection and awareness of internal states. It has also been linked to emotion processing and the ability to monitor bodily sensations. Meanwhile, the superior frontal gyrus is thought to help integrate cognitive and emotional information and is involved in controlling impulses. The researchers found that lower activity in these areas was associated with more severe ADHD symptoms, suggesting a link between brain function and the difficulties experienced by people with the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed interesting differences between men and women with ADHD. While no sex differences in brain activity were found in the group without the disorder, women with ADHD showed greater activation in several brain regions compared to men with ADHD. These included the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the insula, the caudate, the cuneus, and the precuneus. These areas are associated with emotion regulation, attention, and self-monitoring. The findings may suggest that women with ADHD engage more of their brain’s regulatory systems during the anticipation of a decision, possibly as a compensatory strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This result was unexpected, given that earlier studies have found that women with ADHD may experience more difficulties with emotional regulation and internalizing symptoms like anxiety. One possible explanation is that women with stronger emotional processing skills may show less neural activation during emotional tasks, suggesting a more efficient processing style. Alternatively, women with ADHD may develop strategies that mask their symptoms, including more active engagement of brain areas that help regulate behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also worth noting that, despite these brain differences, men and women did not show significant differences in reaction time on the task. This suggests that people may arrive at similar outward behavior through different internal processes, a finding that highlights the importance of looking beyond surface-level performance in psychological research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study offers important insights, it also has limitations. The sample size was relatively small, particularly when broken down by both sex and diagnosis, which limits how broadly the findings can be applied. Additionally, although participants were asked to stop taking ADHD medications 24 hours before the study, some effects of the medication may have lingered and influenced brain activity. The study also focused on young adults, so it may not capture how these processes change with age or in more diverse populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future studies with larger samples and longer medication washout periods will be important for confirming and expanding on these findings. In particular, researchers may benefit from combining brain imaging with physiological measures, like heart rate or skin conductance, to get a fuller picture of how the body and brain interact during decision-making. This approach could help build a more complete model of how emotions and bodily signals influence the choices made by people with ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.70215" target="_blank"&gt;Neural Correlates and Sex-Specific Effects of Affectively Driven Processes Underlying Decision-Making in Adult ADHD&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Eva Halbe, Alec Jamieson, Moritz Bergmann, Aylin Mehren, Ben J.

She boasts about how she’ll beat opponents, and says “bless your heart” while hurtling over rooftops to avoid clusterstrikes of enemy fire. When she’s hit, she “respawns” – or comes back to life at a checkpoint – and jumps right back into the fray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The military shooter game has a predominantly young male user base, but Statham’s Twitch handle is &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/tacticalgramma" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;TacticalGramma&lt;/a&gt; – a nod to the 60-year-old’s two grandkids.

Keep on doing what you’re doing’... things like that, that really tug at your heart,” says Will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Gaming can help people with a variety of ailments, says Dr Kris Alexander, a leading authority in video game design and associate professor of media production at Toronto Metropolitan University who helped launch &lt;a href="https://gamerx.ca/about-gamerx" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;GameRx&lt;/a&gt;, an online resource hub for information about wellness and gaming. One 2017 study found that “if you play Tetris within 48 hours of a traumatic experience, you can reduce PTSD”, he tells me. “There are studies that show that if you place burn victims in virtual reality in spaces where they’re surrounded by cold elements, you can reduce their pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Alexander believes gaming can be good for seniors; over a video call, he shows me the custom arcade cabinet he’s built to house every game he’s ever owned. “For my retirement,” he tells me. “Absolutely, when I get older, I’m going to be playing video games.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;However, common conditions like joint pain and vision decline can hinder senior gamers. As that demographic grows, so may demand for accessibility tools. And because the senior player base is relatively small, Alexander acknowledges that the high-budget gaming companies behind blockbuster titles like Call of Duty and Skyrim are unlikely to account for such needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In 2010, Will required surgery implanting a steel plate in his skull; since then, if he sits in a chair “for more than 20 or 30 minutes, everything from the shoulders down to the fingertips goes numb”, he says. Now, he uses a hand-shaped gaming keypad called the Azeron Cyborg II, which allows users with limited hand mobility or strength to position PC keys so they’re easy and comfortable to reach. Other adaptive controllers, including &lt;a href="https://www.voicebot.net/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;voice-control technology&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://ablegamers.org/adaptive-gaming-equipment/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;pedals&lt;/a&gt; designed for control by foot or mouth, and&lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/08/21/xbox-accessibility-adaptive-joystick-thumbstick-toppers/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; 3D printable controller modifications&lt;/a&gt; for consoles like the Xbox and Playstation, are all making gaming increasingly accessible across playing formats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Will hopes that other seniors who see him stream will be inspired to get into gaming. “If I can do it at my age with this handicap, you can, too,” he says. After all, you’re never too old to respawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="f248018d-3b1c-46a6-bfbf-67028560c94c" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.InteractiveAtomBlockElement" class="element element-atom dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figure class="interactive interactive-atom dcr-e6xisx" data-atom-id="interactives/2023/01/interactive-article-structure/portrait-image-mainmedia-feature" data-atom-type="interactive-layout"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 16:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxNb2x2ZWpCcFV2eWpnQnZ5RUZWTlJrNnU1b2xUM29ianRJcjVGdXpFSWl1aVJhUl83ZnNnajlxa3d4RjdSc0poNWVnS0ZXQUNIOHBWMXQyNE5kdnNBUUhNaVppbHVsejdjalczTEphcnVaNW9jUUc0dXlYeGZwdTFrd2l3OUVKUElveDJJNjdKOVRvZnNBamZhVA</guid></item><item><title>这种常见的止痛药可能会增加痴呆风险- Gizmodo | This Common Pain Med Could Be Raising Dementia Risk - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxNcGprYml2V0szbkxaTzB4ZE9aWXlITnA5amtEUjZqY1hCUkZHNFpZRGpFZWpfamoyTUY0aVpaQ244RmE1QXQxSWNrVzcyQXVQNkgzdXF0SWo5Ti1RRWtyVFdzVHRKeGN5ZFlWRVpQNkRITzdkdFVCMzNZcnY4US1xWVRaUUNyWkNvR0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;Chronic pain can be a debilitating experience. A common medication used to manage the condition may come with its own serious dangers, however. Recent research finds an upsetting link between the drug gabapentin and a higher risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at Case Western Reserve University led the study, which examined the medical records of people with chronic low back pain. People taking gabapentin for their back were significantly more likely to develop dementia over time compared to non-users, they found. The results suggest that doctors ought to be more aware of this potential complication, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our findings indicate an association between gabapentin prescription and dementia or cognitive impairment within 10 years,” they wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://rapm.bmj.com/content/early/2025/07/02/rapm-2025-106577"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; last week in the journal Regional Anesthesia &amp;amp; Pain Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/21561-gabapentin"&gt;Gabapentin&lt;/a&gt; is an anti-seizure drug that’s also regularly used to manage nerve pain and restless leg syndrome. And it’s sometimes used to treat chronic low back pain, especially if the nerves are thought to be involved. The drug primarily works by reducing the abnormal electric activity of the brain’s neurons.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As useful as gabapentin can be, &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/pharmacology/articles/10.3389/fphar.2022.910719/full"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt;—if not &lt;a href="https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/62/4/372?ijkey=ed64845ba5414944ceea85840286c984e871ac11&amp;amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha"&gt;all&lt;/a&gt;—research has suggested a possible link to dementia and cognitive impairment. To better understand this potential risk, the study researchers examined its use among chronic low back pain patients. They analyzed the medical records of over 26,000 patients diagnosed with back pain between 2004 and 2024, comparing similar groups of patients who either were or weren’t prescribed gabapentin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People who were prescribed gabapentin six or more times were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with dementia (roughly 30% more likely) and mild cognitive impairment (85% more) than those who weren’t, the researchers found. This increase in relative risk was higher in people under the age of 65 as well as in those taking 12 or more prescriptions of gabapentin (compared to people receiving fewer prescriptions).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These sorts of retrospective studies can only demonstrate a correlation between two things, not prove a clear cause-and-effect relationship. But the findings should motivate further research, both to confirm whether this link is genuine and to figure out the exact mechanisms behind it, the researchers argue. And for now, doctors should at least be more careful in how they prescribe gabapentin, including being more proactive in tracking the cognitive health of their patients taking it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our results support the need for close monitoring in adult patients prescribed gabapentin to assess for potential cognitive decline,” the study researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

Unlike bubonic plague, which killed millions in medieval Europe, it can be spread through airborne droplets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While both are caused by the &lt;em&gt;Yersinia pestis&lt;/em&gt; bacterium, bubonic plague is transmitted through rodent flea bites or contact with contaminated material – and it primarily affects the lymph nodes while pneumonic plague causes pneumonia and respiratory symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Authorities said the person, whose age, name and gender have not been released, had entered the Flagstaff Medical Center emergency department and died on the same day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Hospital operator Northern Arizona Healthcare&lt;a href="https://www.coconino.az.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=3242" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; said in a statement &lt;/a&gt;that “despite appropriate initial management and attempts to provide life-saving resuscitation, the patient did not recover”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The death of the Coconino county resident marks the first recorded pneumonic plague death in the county in 18 years but not the most recent human plague case in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/arizona" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; – the state has recorded seven cases of plague since 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Nationally, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says about seven human cases of plague are reported annually across the country, but only&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps-statistics/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; 15 plague deaths&lt;/a&gt; have been recorded in a 23-year period beginning in 2000. Most cases have been seen in rural areas in the west.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Typically, the CDC says, &lt;em&gt;Yersinia pestis&lt;/em&gt; cycles naturally among wild rodents. And while most people contract the disease though flea bites, they can become infected through exposure to sick pets, especially cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The plague death comes as officials in the county are investigating a sudden die-off of prairie dogs north-east of Flagstaff that may be caused by plague. County officials have said they do not think the human plague death and the prairie dog mortalities are related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But they also issued guidelines about how to avoid contracting the plague, including avoiding contact with wild animals, touching sick or dead animals, camping near rodent burrows, or sleeping directly on the ground. They advise using insect repellent and tucking the cuffs of your trouser leg into your socks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Coconino county health officials said the risk of human-to-human transmission of pneumonic plague is low. The last such transmission was in Los Angeles in 1924, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2595158/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according to National Institutes of Health (NIH) data.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Still, the symptoms of the Black Death – named for black spots that appeared on infected bodies – remain present. US health officials say plague symptoms typically appear within eight days after exposure and may include fever, chills, headache, weakness and muscle pain, and some may develop swollen lymph nodes (called “buboes”), most commonly in the groin, armpits or limbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But the timing of the human plague death, and the prairie dog die-off, is raising concerns. Plague is one of many diseases endemic to the south-western US, including West Nile virus, hantavirus and rabies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Trish Lees, communications manager for Coconino county,&lt;a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2025/07/09/prairie-dogs-dying-arizona/84512692007/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt; told the Arizona Republic &lt;/a&gt;the number of prairie dogs that have died was unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 15:35:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxQMEl2UG5lbW81SDJHLV8tRldoMGNhU2VkZW5OOW5NWWdKcGw3eVNCMHJQdTQyUG9sXzdackUzbWFjMEFXS1I3UjVBbTFLamFTZ2pVYm0wdTN3N1ItSktWYnZTNWRpclduX0VwU09kUy1meEdMalQxTGU5QS1tamZPc205eXg</guid></item><item><title>为什么饮食和运动在GLP-1药物治疗期间仍然很重要- Mass General Brigham | Why Diet and Exercise Still Matter During Treatment with GLP-1 Medications - Mass General Brigham</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwgFBVV95cUxQeXlyUm5ZMDVtdFRremJmNUNIeUttbDdGa2F1Q2FfT2ViNUtOT2pkdVRocHJyS1hja2RHOEd1QlVTT2ZNX2hUQklNVVVZUVVpYjVoMG9BMS1zemVVSGlVb1pOcHp6MUN4WUgzb3FPSVpQenBJQ3BBNS0wSzM5RGhseTdxc045eG5wZmxFTFppMk5ieHNWZFdpWFBGa2FzNHlDOUd5c196WXV6LXRnVE5JdkVMZUV4cFBtYzduVWRVbGE2UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-cmp-data-layer='{"text-c565f4dd0c":{"@type":"aem-mgb/components/text","repo:modifyDate":"2024-01-11T23:56:50Z","xdm:text":"&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;About Mass General Brigham&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;\r\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Mass General Brigham is an integrated academic health care system, uniting great minds to solve the hardest problems in medicine for our communities and the world.

It is not spread from person to person but rather through bites from infected mosquitoes. The insects pick up the virus from birds, the natural reservoir for the virus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Older adults, people with weakened immune systems, and those with certain chronic conditions face the highest risk of severe illness due to West Nile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even survivors of severe West Nile illness may experience long-lasting complications, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-6127023/Nebraska-man-says-paralyzed-left-partially-deaf-contracting-West-Nile-virus.html"&gt;including memory problems, chronic fatigue, muscle tremors, or permanent neurological damage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is the leading mosquito-borne disease in the US and is spread to humans through bites from infected mosquitoes. Most cases occur during mosquito season, which typically begins in the spring and lasts through the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD) Vector Control Specialist Nicholas Baldauf said: 'Generally, the species of mosquitoes that carry West Nile Virus are active from dusk to dawn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Residents can prevent mosquito bites by using insect repellent on exposed skin or choosing to wear long sleeves and pants. Both methods are effective at reducing or eliminating the possibility of getting a mosquito bite.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anne Dillard, &lt;span&gt;an Atlanta woman, was left 'practically paralyzed' from the waist down after contracting West Nile virus from a mosquito bite. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She collapsed at home and was rushed to Emory University Hospital, where doctors confirmed the infection. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite retaining sensation, she lost muscle strength, leaving her unable to sit, stand, or walk. She also suffered from lethargy, loss of appetite, and a spreading rash.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Anne Dillard, from Atlanta, Georgia, revealed that she had been 'practically paralyzed' by her West Nile Virus infection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her case emerged just minutes after Dr Anthony Fauci revealed his own West Nile diagnosis, highlighting how even healthy individuals can face severe symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile John Proctor VI, an 18-year-old from Missouri became paralyzed from the neck down and relies on a ventilator to breathe after contracting West Nile virus from a mosquito bite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The previously healthy teen, who recently graduated high school and was training to become a diesel mechanic, first developed headaches and dizziness in early August before his condition rapidly worsened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within days, he suffered slurred speech, muscle weakness, and paralysis, prompting his parents to rush him to the hospital fearing a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-13575965/west-nile-virus-outbreak-officials-concerned-record-high-cases-states.html"&gt;confirmed a rare neuro-invasive form of West Nile virus, which attacks the nervous system.&lt;/a&gt; His father described the ordeal as 'out of nowhere' and said his son is now battling stroke-like symptoms and pneumonia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no cure, only rest and pain management, and recovery can take months, often with lasting effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;West Nile, first detected in 1999, now appears nationwide, causing about 2,200 severe cases and 180 deaths annually. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every spring, the ACHD treats known mosquito breeding sites with larvicide and sets traps to monitor for West Nile and other viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;John Proctor VI is on ventilator to help him breathe after being diagnosed with West Nile virus. His parents, John Proctor V and his mom stand by his bedside &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The 18-year-old had just graduated high school in the Spring &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These surveillance efforts help track disease risk and inform decisions about when additional measures, such as nighttime mosquito spraying, are necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Baldauf said: 'Mosquitoes can breed in as little as a half inch of stagnant water, so residents should pay close attention to potential breeding sites like stagnant water in tires, unused swimming pools, buckets, corrugated piping, and clogged gutters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;West Nile is primarily spread by Culex mosquitoes, which transmit the virus through their saliva. They mainly live near stagnant water sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mosquito-borne disease experts are increasingly alarmed that as global temperatures climb toward dangerous new thresholds, warmer, wetter, and more humid conditions will take hold in regions that were once too cool for large mosquito populations.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These shifting climates create ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes, extending their active season and speeding up their life cycles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As species like Culex mosquitoes expand into new areas, their longer lifespans and faster viral incubation times give them more opportunities to spread dangerous illnesses, not just West Nile virus, but also malaria, dengue fever, and Zika.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The health department urges people to protect themselves by clearing standing water from their yards, using screens on windows and doors, and applying insect repellent to exposed skin, particularly during dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are most active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 15:04:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxPbWlmaDVnWEZZRjBpUGJ4RngtUVNENmVRcE9uN3NBUmhNaGt6NU9pNk91UjFNcGlUbDRzTGdqU0JLb3ZSZE15dE5NUFY1dV8tdl9PU19SVFgyelUzYzNvenN0cWQ5dTlSM09LYVRlZUU5dGZaekl5WHFpeUZ1b05Zb2thdHl6b1p1TmFwd1psdWo0akdoanpNdF9hekZGZDlQYXZoVmJIVVVVQdIBrwFBVV95cUxOSk9YaGt1RkZHX3lvOWRBQk9sNjBid1Nqa19XbTJ5MGxGb2xsZW5mWF9FZVZvMGpsQ2wtc1hoWHNuMm1iRHpxcC1pMmdCT1d5b3U2eVBSNkFuTzhadmlLOUUwR0FkZFYydjl4SVhNTjI4bktSOV9JNy1hYVVBeUZjVk13OVFGdlFQZXdXNmRldXkxczNyVEJJdmZ1aEhpeGdaYV9qYjlndDMxSFpEVGxR</guid></item><item><title>科学家说，这些严重的疾病现在比心脏病发作更致命- AOL.com | Scientists Say These Serious Conditions Are Now Bigger Killers Than Heart Attacks - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxOVWhqMGtpdDFNcER0YUE0ZVBnenZPd084NzNkc2Q2MmktZ2tONUlUUU5aaWoxdHNPODBqOUNWRUI1OUhnbHJWaGVibGljbmthR0l2SGtwOFJlMnZ3WFFidjhZd25VRk5NYjVyc0V6MENXNFhVNzJFMnlTblZpMllNVg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heart attack-related deaths are down by nearly 90% since 1970, according to a new study.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;However, other heart disease-related deaths are on the rise.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We asked experts to explain the findings and how to prevent heart health issues.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study published by the American Heart Association (AHA) measured heart disease-related deaths over nearly 50 years, and while the results showed heart attack-related deaths were down 90%, other heart conditions are on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;a href="https://www.pccmn.com/elizabeth-klodas" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Elizabeth Klodas, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Elizabeth Klodas, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a preventative cardiologist and founder and chief medical officer of Step One Foods; &lt;a href="https://www.beverlyhillscardiovascular.com/dr-setareh-bio/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sam Setareh, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sam Setareh, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, director of cardiology and cardiovascular performance at Beverly Hills Cardiovascular and Longevity Institute; &lt;a href="https://lluh.org/provider/hoff-jason" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jason Hoff, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jason Hoff, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, structural interventional cardiologist and assistant professor of medicine at Loma Linda University Health.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.038644" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that heart attack-related deaths decreased by almost 90% between 1970 and 2022.

Essentially, the common cause of heart disease-related death has moved from “out of the blue” ischemic events like heart attacks to long-term, slow-burning heart conditions that do damage over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We asked cardiologists what the findings mean, how the statistics could continue to change over the next half-century, and most importantly, how we, as a population, can continue to &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a63189227/cardiologist-recommended-heart-health-tips/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:improve heart health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;improve heart health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How did the numbers change?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early intervention, medication, and public awareness of &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a25455684/heart-attack-symptoms-in-women-viral-tweet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart attack symptoms;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart attack symptoms&lt;/a&gt; have advanced greatly and contributed to the major decrease in heart attack deaths. “We are now saving people who would have died in the past. That’s great progress,” says &lt;a href="https://www.pccmn.com/elizabeth-klodas" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Elizabeth Klodas, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Elizabeth Klodas, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a preventive cardiologist and founder and chief medical officer of Step One Foods. She adds that heart attack survivors are seeking help more quickly and receiving life-saving treatment such as stents and cholesterol-controlling medications like statins. Smoking cessation has also contributed to the numbers, adds &lt;a href="https://www.beverlyhillscardiovascular.com/dr-setareh-bio/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sam Setareh, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sam Setareh, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, director of cardiology and cardiovascular performance at Beverly Hills Cardiovascular and Longevity Institute. “These gains show that when we invest in prevention, education, and access to care, we can make a real difference,” concludes &lt;a href="https://lluh.org/provider/hoff-jason" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jason Hoff, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jason Hoff, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, structural interventional cardiologist and assistant professor of medicine at Loma Linda University Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Dr. Klodas stresses that “we’ve only kicked the can down the road,” because long-term, post-cardiac event lifestyle changes that prevent chronic disease and risk factors like high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity, are lacking—diet being a huge one. “95% of Americans don’t get enough fiber, 90% take in more sodium than is recommended, the majority of U.S. adults consume less than one serving of fruit or vegetables per day,” she explains. “How can we expect our engines (hearts) to function properly if we’re constantly pouring in the wrong fuel?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Setareh adds that heart disease risk factors like obesity, diabetes, and hypertension are more prevalent now than ever. As people live longer, age-related cardiac conditions like heart failure and arrhythmias become more common. Lastly, improved diagnoses and tracking may also be capturing more deaths overall, he concludes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to maintain a healthy heart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the experts we spoke to have heart-healthy recommendations that are simple and align with those established by the &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/nutrition-basics/aha-diet-and-lifestyle-recommendations" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:AHA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;AHA&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat a balanced whole foods and plant-forward diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limit saturated fats from processed foods and things like butter, cheese, and marbled meats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t smoke (including vaping).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limit alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get regular physicals and bloodwork to remain aware of your cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar, all of which can change without you knowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study underscores that cardiovascular disease is not a single enemy, it’s a moving target,” says Dr. Setareh. “Our strategies must evolve just as the disease burden does. It’s not just about surviving a heart attack anymore. It’s about preventing the chronic heart conditions that follow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Hoff agrees. “After treating a patient for a heart attack, there is often a sense of joy and relief among the patient and their family. It feels like a crisis has been averted, and in many ways, it has. But I often tell them that this is not the finish line,” he explains. “It is the starting point for a new phase of life that requires consistent attention to risk factors, medications, lifestyle changes, and follow-up care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 13:42:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxOVWhqMGtpdDFNcER0YUE0ZVBnenZPd084NzNkc2Q2MmktZ2tONUlUUU5aaWoxdHNPODBqOUNWRUI1OUhnbHJWaGVibGljbmthR0l2SGtwOFJlMnZ3WFFidjhZd25VRk5NYjVyc0V6MENXNFhVNzJFMnlTblZpMllNVg</guid></item><item><title>发现隐藏在人体细胞内的神秘新结构- ScienceAlert | Mysterious New Structure Discovered Hiding Inside Human Cells - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxNbkJocVFLdXk4WXA0XzQ2QmthZjlfUDUwVjJXTXkxRHpfOVNUVmk5TGVHekc5QW5PRDUtWUNyTjlEUEhmSFdpZUN0eWowWURFNmdXUEloOGFoNGcxbjBTejg4d0hoVjA5VGpoTVM3OHJMdEdLel81TlBvX0FKZ3JTX09sQVh4MzlQdXpBSXo5RnBCSUVp?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;After centuries of mapping the human body in ever-finer detail, scientists are still making discoveries. Here we are, in 2025, and a previously unknown cellular structure that could be vital to our health has just been added to the anatomy books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The membrane-bound &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tiny-organs-hiding-in-our-cells-could-challenge-the-origins-of-life"&gt;organelle&lt;/a&gt; appears to play a huge role in helping cells sort, discard, and recycle their contents. It's called a hemifusome, and a team of scientists says it could shed new light on disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is like discovering a new recycling center inside the cell," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uvahealth.com/2025/06/25/scientists-discover-unknown-organelle-inside-our-cells/"&gt;said biophysicist Seham Ebrahim&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Virginia. "We think the hemifusome helps manage how cells package and process material, and when this goes wrong, it may contribute to diseases that affect many systems in the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only that, the discovery helps us better understand the turnover and trafficking of compounds vital to the continuing function of our cellular machinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-just-discovered-a-new-cell-it-was-predicted-100-years-ago?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scientists Just Discovered a New Cell.

Commun.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells like those making up a human body are highly complex, making it difficult to tease apart the fine structures responsible for their many processes. Even using highly sensitive technologies such as electron microscopy, samples need to be contained in a vacuum, which makes a mess of biological materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, however, a technique has emerged that allows us to probe biological samples almost down to atomic scales in three dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's called cryogenic electron tomography, or &lt;a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/au/en/home/electron-microscopy/life-sciences/cryo-tomography/workflow.html"&gt;cryoET&lt;/a&gt;. Samples are frozen in a cryogenic medium too quickly for ice crystals to form and damage the fragile tissue; then scientists can study the material at high resolution, firing a beam of electrons through the sample to take a series of two-dimensional images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these two-dimensional slices can be used to create a three-dimensional reconstruction of the specimen detailed enough to reveal the internal structure of cells and molecules in high resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the technique a team of researchers used to study different kinds of mammalian tissue – monkey, human, rat, and mouse. In all four of the cell types they studied they found multiple sacs that facilitate the formation of pairs of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicle_(biology_and_chemistry)"&gt;vesicles&lt;/a&gt; divided by a wall called a hemifusion diaphragm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These vesicles, the researchers say, act a bit like sorting receptacles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167619" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167619" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/hemifosume-diversity.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-167619" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/hemifosume-diversity.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/hemifosume-diversity-404x415.jpg 404w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/hemifosume-diversity-600x617.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167619" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Hemifusome structures can take a variety of different shapes.

Commun.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can think of vesicles like little delivery trucks inside the cell," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uvahealth.com/2025/06/25/scientists-discover-unknown-organelle-inside-our-cells/"&gt;Ebrahim explains&lt;/a&gt;. "The hemifusome is like a loading dock where they connect and transfer cargo. It's a step in the process we didn't know existed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers performed experiments with gold nanoparticles and cultured human cells to determine whether the way hemifusomes take up materials from their surroundings is similar to what has been observed in other cells. Interestingly, it appears that hemifusomes behave differently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More work needs to be done to figure out what the organelle does, how it does it, and how it fits into the bigger picture of cellular machinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research could also reveal the role hemifusomes play in disease, since an inability to process cellular cargo properly can cause significant health setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're just beginning to understand how this new organelle fits into the bigger picture of cell health and disease. It's exciting because finding something truly new inside cells is rare – and it gives us a whole new path to explore," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uvahealth.com/2025/06/25/scientists-discover-unknown-organelle-inside-our-cells/"&gt;Ebrahim says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now that we know hemifusomes exist, we can start asking how they behave in healthy cells and what happens when things go wrong. That could lead us to new strategies for treating complex genetic diseases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59887-9"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Disrupted circadian rhythms from artificial light at night can affect immune function, neuroinflammation, metabolism, sleep, and mood.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Dr. Randy Nelson’s lab is testing real-world solutions like blocking disruptive light in ICUs and using bright blue light visors for night shift nurses.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;He advocates for better awareness of time-of-day effects in research and everyday life.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Simple changes like limiting nighttime blue light could help protect your brain’s natural rhythms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORGANTOWN, W.V. —&lt;/strong&gt; It’s 2 a.m., and instead of sleeping, someone is scrolling through their phone under bright hospital lights, working the night shift at a factory, or binge-watching Netflix until dawn. What seems like harmless modern behavior might actually be wreaking havoc on the brain in ways scientists are only beginning to understand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Randy Nelson, who chairs the Department of Neuroscience at West Virginia University, has spent the last 15 years investigating something that affects millions of Americans daily: how exposure to artificial light at night disrupts our internal biological clocks and fundamentally alters &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/brain-function/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain function&lt;/a&gt;. His research examines how disrupted circadian rhythms affect “immune function, neuroinflammation, metabolism, sleep, and mood.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nelson studies shift workers and hospitalized patients, groups that face constant exposure to artificial light during hours when the body expects darkness. His work extends beyond simple sleep problems: he’s investigating how &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/light-pollution/"&gt;light pollution&lt;/a&gt; might be contributing to depression, anxiety, and metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-your-brain-expects-darkness"&gt;Why Your Brain Expects Darkness&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Humans evolved over millions of years with predictable cycles of light and darkness. Our brains contain what scientists call a “master clock.” It’s a small cluster of cells that coordinates when hormones are released, when body temperature changes, and when different organs become active or inactive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When artificial light hits our eyes during nighttime hours, it confuses this internal timing system. The brain receives mixed signals about what time it is, disrupting the natural rhythm that governs nearly every biological process in the body.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nelson’s laboratory work focuses on measuring how this disruption affects the brain and body. His studies examine changes in immune function, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/inflammation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;inflammation levels&lt;/a&gt;, and the production of hormones that regulate mood, hunger, and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/stress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stress response.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shift-workers-face-the-greatest-risk"&gt;Shift Workers Face the Greatest Risk&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nearly 15% of American workers — including &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/nurses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nurses&lt;/a&gt;, factory workers, security guards, and others — work non-traditional hours that put them in chronic conflict with their natural body clocks. Nelson’s research shows this group faces elevated risks for health problems that extend far beyond feeling tired.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The biological effects are measurable. When people are exposed to light during natural sleeping hours, their bodies show changes in how they process blood sugar, potentially increasing &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; risk. The disruption also affects hormones that control hunger and feelings of fullness, which may explain higher obesity rates among shift workers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Brain inflammation, a factor linked to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;, also increases when circadian rhythms are disrupted. Stress hormones that normally follow predictable daily patterns become erratic, affecting everything from blood sugar control to immune system function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-testing-real-world-solutions"&gt;Testing Real-World Solutions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nelson is currently conducting trials that could change how hospitals and workplaces approach lighting. “We have two clinical trials in which we are examining the role of blocking the disruptive effects of light at night on clinical outcomes after stroke and cardiac surgery in the intensive care units,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trials also test bright &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/blue-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;blue light&lt;/a&gt; devices designed to help reset night shift nurses’ body clocks, potentially improving their sleep, thinking abilities, and mood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These studies represent an important step toward applying laboratory discoveries to real-world medical care. Success could lead to new hospital policies and better support systems for the millions of Americans &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/night-shift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;who work overnight shifts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Simple changes might make a difference: using amber or red lights in evening hours, installing blackout curtains, and designing workplaces that consider natural body rhythms rather than fighting against them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-time-of-day-factor"&gt;The Time-of-Day Factor&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nelson advocates for something that might seem minor but could have major implications: requiring scientists to report what time of day they conduct experiments. “The answer to an experimental question may depend in part on the time-of-day when the question is asked,” he notes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Currently, most research papers don’t include this information, even though body rhythms can significantly influence experimental results. This oversight could be affecting the reliability of scientific studies across many fields.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For shift workers, potential solutions include specialized &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/morning-blue-light-therapy-boosts-sleep-quality-older-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;light therapy&lt;/a&gt;, strategic timing of sleep aids like melatonin, and workplace policies that acknowledge biological realities. Some companies have begun installing “circadian lighting” systems that automatically adjust light color and intensity throughout the day to match natural patterns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research even raises broader questions about how modern society is structured. Should cities consider the health impacts of &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/outdoor-lights-diabetes-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;street lighting&lt;/a&gt;? Could building codes support natural &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sleep-wake cycles&lt;/a&gt;? Should families rethink how much lighting to use in the house after sunset?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nelson’s research represents a growing field of study examining how modern environments affect human biology. As his clinical trials progress and more scientists recognize the importance of circadian timing in research, we may see new approaches to everything from hospital design to workplace policies. The challenge now is translating these scientific insights into practical changes that can help millions of people living and working in our 24/7 world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This article is based on an extensive interview with Dr. Randy Nelson, a circadian rhythm researcher at West Virginia University, published in Brain Medicine journal. Nelson’s research combines laboratory studies using animal models with clinical trials in humans. His laboratory measures immune function, neuroinflammation, metabolism, sleep patterns, and mood changes in response to disrupted light-dark cycles. Current clinical trials examine whether blocking disruptive light in intensive care units improves patient outcomes and whether light therapy devices can help reset night shift nurses’ circadian rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nelson’s research demonstrates that artificial light exposure at night disrupts circadian rhythms and causes measurable changes in brain function and behavior. His studies show increased neuroinflammation, altered immune function, disrupted metabolism, and mood changes. The research indicates that circadian disruption affects stress hormone production, glucose metabolism, and hunger-regulating hormones. Clinical trials are ongoing to test whether interventions can improve outcomes for medical patients and shift workers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The interview format means specific details about sample sizes, statistical significance, and experimental controls are not provided. Nelson references “nearly 500 papers” published during his career, but the interview doesn’t detail individual study methodologies or limitations. The clinical trials mentioned are ongoing, so results are not yet available. The research focuses primarily on shift workers and hospitalized patients, which may limit broader applicability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research is supported by NIH grant R21CA276027 and NSF grant 2242771. Nelson is also Co-Investigator on an NSF Track 1 award called “West Virginia Network for Functional Neuroscience and Transcriptomics.” The author affirmed that the interview content was free from conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers are exploring biological differences, focusing on X chromosome-linked genes and hormonal shifts like menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Declines in estrogen during menopause may leave the brain more vulnerable to the tau protein tangles that drive cognitive decline. Understanding these sex-based differences could lead to better, more personalized treatments for Alzheimer’s and related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Women’s two X chromosomes and imperfect silencing may influence Alzheimer’s risk through immune and brain-related genes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Menopause-related drops in estrogen appear to increase vulnerability to tau protein tangles in the brain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hormone therapy after age 70 is linked to higher tau buildup and cognitive decline, emphasizing careful timing of interventions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Harvard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A neglected piece of the Alzheimer’s puzzle has been getting increased scientific attention: why women are twice as likely as men to develop the disease.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One might be tempted to explain the disparity as a natural consequence of women living longer. But those studying the disease say that wouldn’t account for such a large difference, and they’re not precisely sure what would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many factors may be at play, researchers are zeroing in on two where the biological differences between women and men are clear: chromosomes and menopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women have two X chromosomes, and men have an X and a Y. Differences between genes held on the X and Y chromosomes, researchers say, may give women an increased chance of developing Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Menopause, when production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone declines, is another clear difference between the sexes. Those hormones are widely known for their roles in the reproductive system, but estrogen also acts on the brain, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever’s at play is likely part of deeper neurological processes, researchers say, pointing to similar sex-related differences in other conditions. Multiple sclerosis and migraine, for example, are both more common in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease, brain tumors, and epilepsy, by contrast, are more common in men. In some cases — like migraine in women and Parkinson’s in men — increased severity accompanies increased incidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Epidemiologically, we see that for almost all neurological diseases, there are differences in how many biological women and men are affected,” said Anna Bonkhoff, resident and research fellow in neurology at Harvard Medical School and Mass General Brigham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a tendency, for example, in MS and migraine for more females to be affected, while it’s the contrary for brain tumors and Parkinson’s. Just based on these numbers, you get the feeling that something needs to underlie these differences in terms of the biology.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The basic building blocks are genes, which in humans are arranged on 46 chromosomes, organized into 23 pairs. One of those pairs — XX in women and XY in men — contain the genes that define sex-based characteristics, differences that are key areas of exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The X and Y chromosomes differ significantly, Bonkhoff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The X chromosome is rich in genes, while the Y chromosome has lost a significant number over the millennia. Having two X chromosomes, though, doesn’t mean that women have a double dose of the proteins and other gene products produced by those genes, because one of the X chromosomes is silenced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That silencing, however, is imperfect, Bonkhoff said, leaving some genes on the silenced X chromosome active. Studies have shown that genes on the X chromosome are related to the immune system, brain function, and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that biological men and women differ by the number of X chromosomes,” said Bonkhoff, lead author of a recent review article in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt; that examined sex-related differences in Alzheimer’s disease and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of genes for the immune system and regulating brain structure are located on the X chromosome, so the dosages differ to certain degrees between men and women. That seems to have an effect.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key difference between men and women relates to their hormones. All humans have three sex hormones: estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. In women, estrogen and progesterone dominate, while in men testosterone dominates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When one looks at changes between men and women with respect to hormones and aging, menopause is a significant nexus over the course of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Menopause is part of the puzzle, probably one of the bigger ones,” Bonkhoff said. “I’m not saying it’s the only one — aging is relevant by itself, and there’s a lot of interesting research looking at what aging does to the immune system that seems to have implications for cognitive changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women typically go through menopause from their mid-40s to mid-50s. During that time, their ovaries stop producing estrogen and progesterone, resulting in the characteristic symptoms of menopause, like hot flashes, emotional changes, cessation of menstruation, difficulty sleeping, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, Rachel Buckley, associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School, and her colleagues followed that hormonal thread in a study that examined the impact of hormone replacement therapy and the accumulation of the protein tau in the brain, a key characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buckley, who is also an investigator in neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital, found that women who were receiving hormone replacement therapy later in life, after age 70, had significantly higher levels of tau accumulation, and suffered higher cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result, she said, supports the “timing” approach to hormone therapy, which holds that hormone replacement therapy can safely be used to ease the symptoms of menopause, but should not be continued into old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing theory arose in response to a study by the federally funded Women’s Health Initiative in the early 2000s, which showed an association between women taking hormone replacement therapy and increased cognitive decline. That was contrary to expectations from earlier studies that indicated estrogen had protective effects on cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later studies, however, showed that hormone therapy appeared to be protective in younger women but was associated with declining cognition in women age 65 and up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buckley’s research took that work a step further, linking it to physiological changes in the brain. Alzheimer’s disease involves the accumulation of amyloid beta into characteristic plaques in the brain — considered an important hallmark of the condition. Those plaques spur the development of tangles of a protein called tau, which then sparks damaging inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buckley’s research showed that hormone therapy among older women was associated with an increase in tau and with cognitive decline. It was not associated with an increase in amyloid beta, which today is a common therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science Advances &lt;/em&gt;in March and funded in part by the National Institute on Aging, allowed Buckley, Gillian Coughlan, first author and instructor in neurology, and their colleagues to highlight the role of hormone replacement in the accumulation of tau tangles in older women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Buckley said the study also highlights significant areas where work remains to be done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The database used for the study didn’t have information about variables that may be important, such as a woman’s reproductive history, information on when the replacement therapy was initiated, and the length of hormone therapy use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the importance of that missing data, Buckley said, is a step forward even though the fact that it’s missing limits the conclusions that can be made in her study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To remedy that, Buckley is planning her own study that will gather what she believes is all the pertinent data, including reproductive history, and details of hormone therapy use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We work with a lot of secondary data that already exists, and that’s great but there are limitations to what we can do with it,” Buckley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re trying to see if we can set up a new study design where we can really look at the time of menopause, what is changing in the blood, what is changing in the brain, what is changing in cognition, and how that might be associated with later life risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sussing out how biological sex affects risk of Alzheimer’s disease, Bonkhoff and Buckley said, can help us understand Alzheimer’s more generally. That understanding, they said, has the potential to lead to new pathways of treatment and prevention of a disease that, despite decades of research and encouraging recent progress, is still poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s an important aim in medicine to understand and then to innovate in how we can prevent or treat,” Bonkhoff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we can find ways to incorporate sex difference to optimize the treatment for individuals, both men and women, that is the overarching goal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alvin Powell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Harvard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Alvin Powell – Harvard&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adt9243" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sex differences in age-associated neurological diseases—A roadmap for reliable and high-yield research&lt;/a&gt;” by Anna Bonkhoff et al. &lt;em&gt;Science Advance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex differences in age-associated neurological diseases—A roadmap for reliable and high-yield research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once taken into consideration, sex differences in neurological diseases emerge in abundance: (i) Stroke severity is significantly higher in females than in males, (ii) Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology is more pronounced in females, and (iii) conspicuous links with hormonal cycles led to female-specific diagnoses, such as catamenial migraines and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these differences receive increasing attention in isolation, they likely link to similar processes in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence, this review aims to present an overview of the influences of sex chromosomes, hormones, and aging on male and female brains across health and disease, with a particular focus on AD and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The focus here on advancements across several fields holds promise to fuel future research and to lead to an enriched understanding of the brain and more effective personalized neurologic care for all.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 12:34:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE1uWUhNa2ZkNnVZQzEyd1BsRFV4eHFWUFFZWGl6ZEpCREIyZmpvUUwxcHJZTTI2ZWhfc3VEa2ltVi1WaXNyTncyTUJQU0dDRWtIUDM4VWdnWldZanQyZ2FRZ1M5Y2ZVUlFUOFY2ckk1MA</guid></item><item><title>“卵巢可以发育牙齿” ：外科医生正在揭示他们通常不会告诉其他人的人体秘密- BuzzFeed | "Ovaries Can Develop Teeth": Surgeons Are Revealing Secrets About The Human Body That They Don't Typically Tell Other People - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTFBxNy1pemhSMkxlRnNOVHFlSDNQNW9SQXA5WVdxNkZhM2JORGQ3Yi13RGtreDROSGdEeDVmTFNWNkxmR25mT21GNGVXQlBKdEhXNWhpUDhTTDlxWDhzOFJBc25fS1BjY0NJRExBbkMwZmQ3RXlMbmxDRXAxVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research led by Sichuan University in China has revealed that bedtime antihypertensive medication dosing improves nocturnal blood pressure control over morning dosing in patients with hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Hypertension is a major global health challenge. In China, nearly 300 million individuals live with elevated blood pressure and fewer than 17% achieve adequate control. Nocturnal pressure is often the most difficult to manage and can be a better predictor of heart attack and stroke than daytime readings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have examined the optimal timing for antihypertensive medication with conflicting evidence and substantial variability in study outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Morning vs. Bedtime Dosing and Nocturnal Blood Pressure Reduction in Patients With Hypertension: The OMAN Randomized Clinical Trial," &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2836172" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/randomized+clinical+trial/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;randomized clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; to compare bedtime versus &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/morning/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;morning&lt;/a&gt; administration of antihypertensive drugs on nocturnal blood pressure reduction and circadian rhythm control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across 15 hospitals in China, the trial enrolled 720 participants aged 18 to 75 years who either had never received antihypertensive treatment or had discontinued treatment for at least two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were randomly assigned to groups receiving antihypertensive medication either in the morning (6:00–10:00 AM) or at bedtime (6:00–10:00 PM). All patients received a single-pill combination of olmesartan (20 mg) and amlodipine (5 mg), with dosage adjustments based on ambulatory and office blood pressure monitoring every four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;After 12 weeks, the bedtime dosing group showed a greater reduction in nighttime &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/systolic+blood+pressure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;systolic blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, with a between-group difference of -3.0 mm Hg (95% CI, -5.1 to -1.0 mm Hg). Nighttime diastolic blood pressure also decreased more in the bedtime dosing group (-1.4 mm Hg; 95% CI, -2.8 to -0.1 mm Hg).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nighttime systolic blood pressure control rates were higher with bedtime dosing (79.0%) compared with morning dosing (69.8%). Office systolic blood pressure control rates were 88.7% in the bedtime group and 82.2% in the morning group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bedtime dosing also lowered morning systolic and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/diastolic+blood+pressure/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;diastolic blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; with fewer dose escalations. No significant differences were observed in the incidence of nocturnal hypotension or reported adverse effects between groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers conclude that bedtime dosing provided better nocturnal blood pressure control and improved circadian rhythm without reducing the efficacy of mean daytime or 24-hour blood pressure or increasing the risk of nocturnal hypotension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings support the potential advantages of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/bedtime/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bedtime&lt;/a&gt; administration and offer evidence to guide future research on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/antihypertensive/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;antihypertensive&lt;/a&gt; chronotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

You’re also more likely to lose muscle mass and strength or to develop osteoarthritis, and both can put more stress on the muscle you do have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="COV5MCEVYZES3P2UYBOX2H2FFE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As a result, up to 60 percent of older adults live with persistent muscle pain, according to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8034863/" target="_blank"&gt;2020 review in the journal Medical Clinics of North America.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DUKQVJBPE5GHDMP4KASKRTHACY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But there’s a lot you can do to ease that discomfort. Here’s a look at sources of muscle pain and the best routes to feeling better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QF65MQC7MFGXROGK22RJ2V7WLM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;These “pulled” muscles are often more common later in life, Gardner says. The best treatment is a day or two of rest, ice, compression and elevation. But that doesn’t mean lying in bed all day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CTNE3QKEU5HYXC3QQ4VUYPIJWQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Try taking a short walk or marching in place. “Light activity can help reduce muscle pain and stiffness because it encourages blood flow to the area,” she says. After about three days, try to resume your normal activities, but if it hurts, scale back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="K4R6V7Y5M5G5JM4BJZCICVQYRM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You can do a bit of self-massage, too. This increases blood flow to the muscle, which can reduce inflammation and speed healing, says Tiffany Shubert, chair of the American Physical Therapy Association Geriatrics/National Council on Aging Task Force. One method: Put a tennis ball between your body and a wall or the floor, then roll up and down on the sore area. You can also roll a foam roller on tight, achy muscles. But avoid massage guns. “There’s always the concern it could be too rough for some older adults and lead to a fracture,” Shubert says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XKJ2QEDTZ5CULE4MZB72UIUPVI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Feel like you need something more for the pain short term? Over-the-counter oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofen (Advil and generic) can raise the likelihood of gastrointestinal bleeding in older adults. Instead, use acetaminophen (Tylenol and generic) or an OTC topical NSAID cream such as diclofenac. “Follow dosing labels carefully,” Gardner says. “A small amount is still absorbed by the bloodstream into the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EFHO74UVBFBPXFZJ5CUZLLEJ5I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Another option is a topical cream or ointment containing the herb arnica, says Benjamin Kligler, a professor of family and community medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8537440/" target="_blank"&gt;2021 review published in the journal Medicines&lt;/a&gt; found that arnica may be comparable to standard medications for muscle strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DH52YFSQLVCHLIUJRFNINPWW2M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If your pain persists for more than a couple of days or eases and then returns, ask your doctor about seeing a physical therapist. “There may be other factors driving your muscle pain, for example, underlying arthritis or weak hip muscles that place more stress on your knees,” Gardner says. A PT can figure out the cause and recommend appropriate strengthening and stretching exercises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UYHL6DPJWFAAFHQITVH552K3PM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aches from respiratory infections&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CEL277I2TBBVRMIECTZAMTRYV4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you have the flu or covid-19, the muscles all over your body may really hurt. “Older adults often feel muscle aches more intensely during a virus than younger ones, as their muscles tend to be tighter and weaker,” says Michael Hochman, an internist in Oak Park and Sunland, Calif.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QVL43KETC5A3XPQFCL43IZ6NP4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;What to do: Call your doctor for an antiviral prescription (Paxlovid for covid-19 or Tamiflu for the flu). This may ease symptoms and help you recover faster. And while you’re sick, drink plenty of fluids because dehydration can worsen achiness, he says. Water is best. You can also take the over-the-counter pain reliever acetaminophen (Tylenol and generic) to ease aches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YR4BS27UB5GYFOP2QMYT4DG7BU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;More than 32 percent of people between the ages of 70 and 79 experience uncomfortable nighttime leg cramps at least five times a month. “It’s very common because older adults are more vulnerable to factors that raise the risk of muscle cramps, such as dehydration or electrolyte imbalances,” Kligler says. The natural shortening of your tendons as you age can also make the cramps more likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NGDMWZA7HBCWBK5SHWC72MR75U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If a painful leg cramp wakes you up at night, Kligler recommends stretching your calf. You can do this while standing up or even while lying down in bed. For the latter, with the affected leg straight in front of you and flat on the bed, point your toes toward the ceiling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EQSFNPFRHNBXTCITKJ7U2O7YE4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If that doesn’t provide sufficient relief, try walking around your home until the cramp subsides. After that, elevate your leg to get more blood flowing to the area. You can also take a hot shower or a warm bath (add in some Epsom salts if you like), or use a heating pad on the area that’s cramped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AM6QFKQBDBEHNGACTXKG6ABHGY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you’re prone to nighttime muscle cramps, stretch your calves and hamstrings at least once a day. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8127570/" target="_blank"&gt;2021 Cochrane review&lt;/a&gt; concluded that while this won’t eliminate cramps, it may make them less severe. Kligler also recommends a supplement of about 100 to 200 mg of magnesium before bedtime. But check with your doctor first because magnesium can cause diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4WA33NNBARFV7MQ5HERH6PUODQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you feel achy every day for more than a couple of weeks, see your doctor. You may have a medical problem that needs attention. For widespread pain, for instance, your doctor may have you evaluated by a rheumatologist for fibromyalgia, a chronic condition marked by deep muscle aches and stiffness. “It often starts in your neck or shoulders before spreading to your middle and lower back, arms and legs, and chest wall,” says Don Goldenberg, a rheumatologist and professor emeritus of medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston. You may also notice specific tender points near joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZBTVMYBFZVFXRNJYTM7KVPWQ3Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“One of the best treatments available is cognitive behavior therapy, not because fibromyalgia is ‘all in your head’ but because it gives you coping tools to help live with the condition,” Goldenberg says. Low-impact activities such as walking, water aerobics, tai chi and gentle yoga may help, too. “We know that people who do moderate exercise regularly with fibromyalgia have lower pain levels.” You may also need an antidepressant that targets the brain chemicals that process pain. If that doesn’t work, your doctor may recommend an anticonvulsant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XIF2D4IVCVAE7E3OAHLBUY6ZPU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Another condition that can cause muscle pain is polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), which occurs almost exclusively in people over age 50, Goldenberg says. “We think of it anytime we have an older adult complain of new-onset aches, pain and stiffness in their neck, shoulders, upper back and hips, particularly in the morning,” he says. Treatment is a long-term (a year or two, or even more) low dosage of a steroid such as prednisone. Your doctor should also monitor you closely for sudden loss of sight, he says. This, and symptoms such as new headaches and high fever, may be signs of a serious condition called giant cell arteritis, which &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9909075/" target="_blank"&gt;one small 2023 study&lt;/a&gt; found was present in more than 40 percent of people with PMR. Treatment for this is usually a short course of high-dose steroids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Y43R7NQ2BNBZDGL54HJMANMSK4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Statin drugs for lowering cholesterol, such as atorvastatin (Lipitor and generic) and rosuvastatin (Crestor and generic), can cause a rare side effect of muscle pain. This occurs in fewer than 5 percent of people, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/s0140-6736(22)01545-8/fulltext#" target="_blank"&gt;2022 paper&lt;/a&gt;, but can be quite uncomfortable. “Patients often tell me that it feels like they got hit with a truck — it’s a whole-body, flu-like experience,” says Chad Worz, chief executive of the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XDNLGJCAAZEYXHHZGGTQL4DFOU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you notice this kind of pain, let your doctor know. They may want you to stop taking your statin drug for about a week, says John Batsis, a geriatrician at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill. If your symptoms improve, the medication was probably the culprit. You can then work with your doctor to reduce the dosage of your current medication or try a different statin altogether. And if these steps don’t help, talk to your doctor about other options for &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/high-cholesterol/your-guide-to-cholesterol-control-a2665297083/" target="_blank"&gt;managing cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p id="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" class="wpds-c-esEUdQ wpds-c-esEUdQ-hqvHjm-isBold-false wpds-c-esEUdQ-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="MX42FHQYCNA47FRI3ZJH4W7M4Q" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Copyright 2024, Consumer Reports Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NGIOUE72HRGJHDJS2MZ36HBWDU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Consumer Reports is an independent, nonprofit organization that works side by side with consumers to create a fairer, safer and healthier world.

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jo Frost, best known as Supernanny, has opened up about a life-threatening health condition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I've survived more anaphylactic shocks than I'm prepared to go into detail about right now.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And, driving home just how life-threatening anaphylactic shock can be, she said:  'If you ignore the severity of this medical condition, it's as bad as shoving a loaded gun in my face.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Frost continued that she is one of 'millions' of people who '&lt;span&gt;live cautiously and anxiously...with not nearly enough compassion, education and empathy' from people who do not suffer from extreme allergic reactions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She added that she—and no doubt other sufferers—feel forced to take full responsibility for what they put in their bodies as others do not take allergies seriously, calling out 'lazy' restaurant staff and large food corporations who are not transparent about their production methods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I'm unapologetic for my medical condition. I did not ask for it, and it does not define who I am and the impact that I make in the world daily,' she said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'But it does impact how I live my life daily, like the precautions I take, the energy I have to use to discern with hyper vigilance whether you do know what you're talking about when you're in a restaurant or just winging it, because you can't be arsed to go to the back of the kitchen and truly ask the chef.' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;She also slammed food manufacturers who 'dodge accountability legally and put your greed before my safety' by placing "it may contain" labels on their products.   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'It means that your inclusion of health and safety standards doesn't apply to me, just non anaphylaxis people out there,' she said.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ms Frost first shot to fame in 2004 when she fronted international hit show Supernanny &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In the show, she helped parents who were at the end of their tether with their unruly kids &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And by the way, I speak on behalf of those who also have coeliac disease too, because we are all not faddy eaters, I'm not looking to be treated special. I'm looking to be treated with the same dignity and attentiveness as you just showed others.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/health/article-14542313/coeliac-disease-symptoms-Olympic-rebecca-adlington-diagnosis.html"&gt;Coeliac disease&lt;/a&gt; is a genetic autoimmune condition which means it develops when your body decides that healthy cells are foreign and so it sends antibodies out to 'protect' your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When someone has coeliac disease, their body triggers an immune response to gluten entering their systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During this process, antibodies are released that damage the lining of their gut and can cause a number of unpleasant symptoms, some of which are not even tummy-related. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-ffacf770-6093-11f0-a21b-5ddd939b6e9d" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14903303/Supernanny-Jo-Frost-reveals-little-known-health-condition-kill-bad-shoving-loaded-gun-face.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;Symptoms of anaphylaxis &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swelling of your throat and tongue&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty breathing or breathing very fast&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Difficulty swallowing, tightness in your throat or a hoarse voice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wheezing, coughing or noisy breathing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling tired or confused&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling faint, dizzy or fainting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skin that feels cold to the touch&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="class"&gt;Blue, grey or pale skin, lips or tongue – if you have brown or black skin, this may be easier to see on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Source: NHS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Frost rounded off her impassioned post by urging establishments to improve the training of their staff, and for food firms to generally do better at creating products that everyone can enjoy without fear of falling ill or dying. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I don't need your mumbling insults, your passive aggressive comments or your ignorance, just your need to be willing to learn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Educate your staff, change your policies, menus, work spaces, school training, event spaces for all, to champion children who are all ours, really, in this world, and show empathy and understanding to each other.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2012, she told US magazine &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.allergicliving.com/2013/07/16/profile-tvs-nanny-jo-frost-on-her-allergies/"&gt;Allergic Living&lt;/a&gt; that she had been hospitalised by her allergies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The worst I’ve dealt with left me in hospital for a couple of days and my blood pressure went really low. [This incident happened three years ago, brought on by a restaurant meal.] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had been told, very confidently, that were no nuts in a particular meal, and there were. It left me never in the same place again.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added that the experience had made her much more cautious about eating out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'What has changed is my ability to trust those who may not be fully informed. You have to read between the lines. At a restaurant if they say, “I think so,” that is not – “I know so”,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now in a restaurant, I ask: “Are you sure?” and “Can I see the chef?” because I have to be in control of my life and responsible for my life, so I will do what’s necessary to do that.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added that while filming Supernanny, all foods which could cause an allergic reaction—and pets—were removed from the family's home and it underwent a very deep clean before shooting began. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Frost added: 'I don’t see myself as a sufferer. I just know there are certain things that I can’t do. For instance, I would love to go horseback riding, but I can’t; it’s life or death. So there are things you can do and things you can’t. For instance, I waterski and cycle, things like that.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 11:26:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>专家无法忍受的10个更年期迷思-《西雅图时报》 | 10 menopause myths the experts can’t stand - The Seattle Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxPcFNqMnZQYndFSnZGNFdKMnp2MmhXY1AtMWJDd1BjUzVRZVEwMVZVcHVWMHlseFJ5VWhpbVFpQTMtTXFxUnl6cDQxLWZfd0VfWnZrZnA4d09Sb1dXNWJzZVIxYThIRkhOZnI5Yy04TFplX1lsVUE2TjcxZ1NlWXhzNXg3VW9UZmVmbHRONEM2WFYtT200LWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxPcFNqMnZQYndFSnZGNFdKMnp2MmhXY1AtMWJDd1BjUzVRZVEwMVZVcHVWMHlseFJ5VWhpbVFpQTMtTXFxUnl6cDQxLWZfd0VfWnZrZnA4d09Sb1dXNWJzZVIxYThIRkhOZnI5Yy04TFplX1lsVUE2TjcxZ1NlWXhzNXg3VW9UZmVmbHRONEM2WFYtT200LWc?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;10 menopause myths the experts can’t stand&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/stories/CAAqNggKIjBDQklTSGpvSmMzUnZjbmt0TXpZd1NoRUtEd2lUd3F2T0RoSE1VZXpCTjdabm55Z0FQAQ?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US:en&amp;amp;oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;View Full Coverage on Google News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 11:00:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxPcFNqMnZQYndFSnZGNFdKMnp2MmhXY1AtMWJDd1BjUzVRZVEwMVZVcHVWMHlseFJ5VWhpbVFpQTMtTXFxUnl6cDQxLWZfd0VfWnZrZnA4d09Sb1dXNWJzZVIxYThIRkhOZnI5Yy04TFplX1lsVUE2TjcxZ1NlWXhzNXg3VW9UZmVmbHRONEM2WFYtT200LWc</guid></item><item><title>学校欺凌者称我为“鲸鱼” -所以我使用简单的家庭方法减掉了一半的体重，而且不花钱-每日邮报 | School bullies called me 'whale' - so I lost HALF my bodyweight using a simple at-home method that cost nothing - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 16-stone law student who was branded a 'whale' by school bullies says she dropped from a size 18 to a tiny size six by using a simple at-home method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jessica Turner, 20, shed an incredible 8st 3lb after deciding she had had enough of taunting by cruel fellow pupils. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Though admitting she was always 'chubby', Jessica said she piled on the pounds after turning to junk food for comfort whilst at school. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, combined with no exercise, saw the 5ft 3in student from Caterham, Surrey eventually tip the scales at 16st 5lb and balloon to a size 18. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jessica says she was picked on by classmates for her weight, with some branding her 'too slow' when walking up stairs, while others dubbed her a 'whale'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So when the Covid &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/coronavirus-lockdowns/index.html" id="mol-81983710-6097-11f0-9cdf-11124d039d40"&gt;lockdown&lt;/a&gt; hit in 2020, Jessica decided to take things into her own hands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The then-15-year-old began doing daily at-home YouTube workouts by watching videos from fitness influencers Joe Wicks and Chloe Ting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also cut out junk food from her diet - instead focusing on eating enough protein. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

I had very low self-esteem so I didn't like going out very much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I looked in the mirror and never really felt beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Covid hit and everything shut down and I thought "I've got an opportunity to better myself and I have a lot of time on my hands".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It started with home workouts on YouTube and I started learning lots about nutrition, I watched Joe Wicks and Chloe Ting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Once it started, I fell in love with the process and once you start seeing results it gets easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was 105kg [16st 5lbs], so my health was on the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Previously, Jessica would regularly eat calorie-laden foods including pizza.

Since the condition can creep up on you without you even realizing it, Dr. Bhatia recommends &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a64745482/best-time-to-take-blood-pressure/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blood pressure evaluations;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;blood pressure evaluations&lt;/a&gt; to all her patients in their 40s. “It’s important to stay on top of [it],” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Kinga Krzeminska - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cardiovascular Exams&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[Heart disease] is the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/womens-health/lcod/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:most common cause of death;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;most common cause of death&lt;/a&gt; in American women,” says &lt;a href="https://www.keciagaither.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kecia Gaither;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Kecia Gaither&lt;/a&gt;, M.D., a board-certified OB/GYN and women’s health expert. And your risk gets higher as you age.

Pap smears screen for &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a44798697/cervical-cancer-still-kills-thousands-of-women/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cervical cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cervical cancer&lt;/a&gt;, and just like any cancer, early detection is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cervical cancer can affect any woman who is or has been sexually active,” Dr. Gaither says. “But it primarily occurs in women who have had HPV, are immune-compromised, have poor nutrition, and don’t get pap smears.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Anchiy - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Eye and Ear Exams&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we age, our vision and hearing often gets worse.

This is especially important if you show risk factors for osteoporosis or frequently fracture your bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Inti St Clair - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Immunizations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Routine immunizations are always important. But since our immune systems can weaken as we age, getting routine vaccinations—like the &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a28943934/flu-shot-over-50/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:flu shot;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;flu shot&lt;/a&gt;—is especially essential as you get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;SDI Productions - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Diabetes Screenings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone will benefit from a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/a37936855/new-guidance-for-diabetes-testing/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:diabetes screening;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;diabetes screening&lt;/a&gt;.

Your doctor can screen you for the condition and help you treat or prevent it, depending on your diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;vgajic - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hormone Checks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pre-menopause and &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a64829816/weird-menopause-symptoms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:menopause;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt; are full of hormonal ups and downs. And while common symptoms—like hair loss, insomnia, low sex drive, and brain fog—are often caused by the condition, they may also signal something more serious. Checking your hormone levels routinely can give your doctor more insight into what you’re experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;YakobchukOlena - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Complete Lipid Panels&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A complete lipid panel—or a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a63398546/cholesterol-myths-facts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; test—is important in assessing your risk for heart disease, which increases as you age. It’s usually part of a routine annual exam. But if your doctor doesn’t mention it, you can ask to have one done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;MoMo Productions - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Skin Checks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting your &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/health-conditions/g20688920/types-of-skin-cancer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:moles checked;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;moles checked&lt;/a&gt; by a dermatologist is a good idea at any age.

        Frank Frost
        
    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;For more than 30 years, Frank Frost worked as a long-distance truck driver, ferrying industrial chemicals across the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I worked away from home six days a week, working up to 12-15 hours a day," says Frost, now 76. "My only exercise was looking for a fast food outlet in the evening when I'd parked up."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He gained weight and was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in his 50s. His doctors put him on insulin injections and told him to lose weight and move more.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When l, like most people, failed, they made me feel weak and worthless," says Frost.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Then, Frost met a doctor with a completely different approach — one that changed his life.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"He asked me what mattered to me, which I'd never been asked before by a doctor," says Frost. "I told him that I wanted to live long enough to see my grandkids grow up." &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The doctor also asked Frost about things he enjoyed doing as a kid and discovered he used to love riding a bike. He gave him a prescription for a 10-week cycling course called &lt;a href="https://pruk.azurewebsites.net/tblnews_list.php?page=list" target="_blank"&gt;Pedal Ready&lt;/a&gt; for adults getting back into cycling.  &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I hadn't been on a bike for almost 50 years until I started cycling again," says Frost.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;What Frost's doctor had done was give him a social prescription, says journalist Julia Hotz, who's written about Frost's experience in her new book &lt;a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Connection-Cure/Julia-Hotz/9781668030349" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Connection Cure: The Prescriptive Power of Movement, Nature, Art, Service, and Belonging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's the idea of health professionals "literally prescribing you a community activity or resource the same way they'd prescribe you pills or therapies," she explains. The prescriptions include exercise, art, music, exposure to nature and volunteering, which are known to have enormous benefits to physical and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And it all starts with "flipping the script from what's the matter with you to focusing on what matters to you," Hotz says. "What are your activities that you love? What gets you out of bed in the morning?"&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Frost's prescription helped him make friends after years in a solitary profession.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And it helped him lose 100 pounds, get his diabetes under control and go off insulin. He says he still bikes with friends he made through the biking class. They call themselves the "Chain Gang," and members look after each other.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We're all of a certain age," says Frost. " We don't leave anybody. It's changed my life."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Tapping into lifestyle's role in health&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Social prescriptions are not intended to replace pills or therapies, says Hotz, but to complement them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer are now the leading cause of death worldwide. And decades of research has shown that adopting healthy habits can stave them off.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For instance, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2023/08/23/1193148718/why-a-strangers-hello-can-do-more-than-just-brighten-your-day" target="_blank"&gt;social connection&lt;/a&gt; lifts our mood and benefits health overall — and friends can &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/15/nx-s1-5217975/the-secret-to-doing-hard-things-and-getting-stuff-done" target="_blank"&gt;hold people accountable&lt;/a&gt; when building new, healthy habits. &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/08/22/1195337204/a-guide-to-forest-bathing" target="_blank"&gt;Time in nature&lt;/a&gt; can reduce stress, says Hotz. Studies also show that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/05/nx-s1-5247787/depression-walking-step-count-fitness-tracker" target="_blank"&gt;exercise can ease depression and anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/03/12/591513777/hearts-get-younger-even-at-middle-age-with-exercise" target="_blank"&gt;boost cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;. And music and arts are known to be therapeutic for people with mental and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/02/19/1081263873/mental-health-art-therapy" target="_blank"&gt;behavioral disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health care providers in about 30 countries are doing social prescribing to address symptoms of Type 2 diabetes, chronic pain, dementia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and depression,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;among others&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; Hotz says. And a growing number of providers — around 250 so far — in the United States are starting to use them, too, according to &lt;a href="https://www.socialprescribingusa.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Social Prescribing USA&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit organization advocating for this approach.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Social prescribing, really has the promise and the research to back it up to change health care in ways that would be healing for all of us," says&lt;a href="https://www.socialprescribingusa.com/alan-siegel" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Alan Siegel&lt;/a&gt;, a family physician at Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, Calif., and executive director of Social Prescribing USA.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The National Health Service in the U.K. has incorporated social prescribing, covering the cost of hiring caseworkers to connect patients to the right community group. Most prescribers in the U.S. partner with community organizations offering group activities.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But in some instances, health insurers help cover related costs. For example, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield has &lt;a href="https://www.newjerseystage.com/articles/2021/07/13/horizon-blue-cross-blue-shield-of-nj-supports-njpacs-capital-campaign-new-arts-and-wellness-initiative-with-3m-grant/" target="_blank"&gt;partnered with the New Jersey Performing Arts Center&lt;/a&gt; to connect high utilizers of the health system to arts and culture programs in the community.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Health and cost benefits&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Studies in the U.K., which routinely uses social prescribing, show that not only does it improve health, it also saves money.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's a reduction in emergency room visits, in repeat visits to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9615419/" target="_blank"&gt;primary care providers&lt;/a&gt;, and that over time generates a pretty significant return on investment," Hotz says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health care systems are increasingly recognizing that "it's cheaper for them to cover 10 weeks of Zumba classes than it is to cover, for example, high blood pressure medication over the course of a lifetime, or GLP agonists over the course of a lifetime," she adds.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A report on &lt;a href="https://irp.cdn-website.com/92bb31b3/files/uploaded/A_Healthier_Canada-An_Analysis_of_the_Potential_Economic_and_Social_Impacts_of_Social_Prescribing.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;social prescribing in Canada&lt;/a&gt; found that for older adults, there was nearly $300 million cost saving from lower hospitalizations, emergency calls and visits to the ER due to fewer falls. Among youth, they found a 14% increase in lifetime earnings for youth ages 15-17 struggling with anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.artpharmacy.co/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22390708514&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAApn8V2F4tL_I-kz3vaQ3CQTVyGSNk&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw1JjDBhDjARIsABlM2SvC6D9qY0-5fGRyJxO6xWkZY81NBUDa56nx8Y1tSZsP7pg4INj6YpkaApGvEALw_wcB" target="_blank"&gt;Art Pharmacy&lt;/a&gt;, a Georgia-based program that collaborates with health systems, insurers and universities to connect patients with cultural activities, reports that more than two-thirds of people participating saw improved mental health, and a reduction in ER visits.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Doctors at &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/departments/community-care/depts/geriatric" target="_blank"&gt;the Center for Geriatric Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; have found social prescribing especially valuable for seniors, says &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/22798-ardeshir-hashmi" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Ardeshir Hashmi&lt;/a&gt;, chief of geriatrics.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They now regularly ask patients questions like: "What was your career in? Who else is at home? Do you have friends? Do you have family? What do you enjoy doing and are you still doing those things?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hashmi has had patients who want to be more connected to nature, or want to resume being a member of a book club, or engage in creating art, or in volunteering.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;His patients have seen "significant improvement" in levels of loneliness, he says, as well as in symptoms of depression, anxiety and memory problems.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;What lights you up? Find a prescription for yourself&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Anyone interested in social prescribing can &lt;a href="https://www.socialprescribingusa.com/initiative-tracker" target="_blank"&gt;check out a map&lt;/a&gt; on Social Prescribing USA's website for a list of organizations and health systems that are doing this in some capacity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The kinds of programs listed include &lt;a href="https://walkwithadoc.org/who-we-are/our-mission/" target="_blank"&gt;Walk with a Doc&lt;/a&gt;, an organization hosting walks with doctors in communities in 54 states and territories. It's aimed at helping people embrace walking together for health. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And if you're not seeing something in your area, try asking your doctor for help, even if they aren't familiar with social prescribing, suggests Hashmi.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He suggests asking your doctor questions like, "Is there a community you can connect me with? This is what matters most to me in my life. I've lost that at some point over time. Are there other patients that you know of that you could connect me with? Is there a community organization that you know of?"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And if your doctor is unable to help you, Hotz suggests turning to the internet to look for community organizations already doing what you are seeking, whether it's hiking, drawing, singing, swimming, volunteering with kids, or spending time with friends.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's a ton of options to choose from, a lot of options at local libraries, local parks departments, a ton of groups trying to make social prescriptions free or low cost to people," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The key, Hotz says, is asking yourself the right questions before you start looking for a community organization to join. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, "What lights you up in the morning? If you had two more hours in the week, what would you spend it doing? What was an activity you loved to do as a kid but haven't had a chance to do since?" she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

But for people with diabetes, who must watch their carbohydrate and sugar intake closely, the natural sugar content in mango raises important questions: Is it safe to eat? Can it be part of a balanced diet? And what does the research say?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="26638092" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="can-diabetics-eat-mango" source="keywords"&gt;Can diabetics eat mango&lt;/keyword&gt;? Here's why this sweet fruit can be a smart choice&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mango often gets a bad rap for being too sweet—but in reality, it can be a healthy, diabetes-friendly fruit when enjoyed in moderation. Despite its natural sugar content, mango is rich in nutrients, fibre, and antioxidants that support overall health and may help manage blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Diabetes Management Made Simple: 5 Yoga Asanas That Work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One cup of sliced mango (about 165 grams) provides 99 calories, 25 grams of carbohydrates, and 22.5 grams of natural sugar, along with 2.6 grams of dietary fibre. It also delivers 67% of your daily vitamin C, 18% folate, 20% copper, and 10% each of vitamins A and E, plus 6% potassium. These nutrients boost immunity, support metabolism, and contribute to overall wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly for people with diabetes, mango has a low glycemic index (GI) of around 51, which means it raises blood sugar more slowly than high-GI foods. The fibre content helps slow digestion and sugar absorption, reducing the risk of sudden glucose spikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While over 90% of mango’s calories come from sugar, its nutritional profile makes it a better option than many processed or high-starch snacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to its balance of natural sugars, fibre, and micronutrients, mango can be a smart carb choice in a diabetes-friendly diet—as long as portion sizes are controlled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Studies supports moderate mango consumption&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2014 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4155986/#:~:text=However%2C%20there%20were%20no%20significant,effect%20on%20fasting%20blood%20glucose." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published in the journal Nutrition and Metabolic Insights found that overweight individuals who consumed 10 grams of freeze-dried mango daily experienced improvements in blood sugar control.

These effects were observed when mango was eaten in moderation and not paired with high-starch or high-fat foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to make mango more diabetes-friendly&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have diabetes, you don’t necessarily need to avoid mango altogether—but how much you eat and what you eat it with can make a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start by focusing on portion size. One standard carbohydrate serving equals about 15 grams of carbs. A half-cup of sliced mango (around 82.5 grams) contains roughly 12.5 grams of carbs, making it a safe starting portion for most people with diabetes. Eating more than this in one sitting could raise your blood sugar more than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make mango even easier on your blood sugar, pair it with a source of protein or healthy fat. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add mango slices to Greek yoghurt or cottage cheese&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Enjoy it with a boiled egg or a handful of nuts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blend it into a smoothie with protein powder and chia seeds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These combinations slow digestion, which helps reduce blood sugar spikes and keeps energy levels more stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also important to avoid mango in processed forms. Mango juice, dried mango, and sweetened mango products often contain added sugars and minimal fibre, making them much more likely to spike blood sugar levels quickly. Stick to fresh mango in controlled portions for the healthiest option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When and how to eat mango if you have diabetes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timing matters when it comes to fruit and blood sugar. Many doctors and dietitians suggest eating fruit like mango earlier in the day, when your insulin sensitivity is naturally higher. This means your body is better able to handle carbohydrates and convert them into energy without spiking blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another simple trick is to cut mango into small cubes. This helps you slow down while eating and makes it easier to enjoy the sweet flavour in smaller, more satisfying portions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also helpful to understand how mango sugar is processed in the body. About 30% of the sugar in mango is fructose, which is metabolised by the liver. While moderate amounts are fine for most people, excess fructose can increase triglyceride levels—a type of fat in the blood linked to heart disease. This is especially important for people who have both diabetes and high cholesterol. In short, mango can be a healthy, diabetes-friendly treat when eaten mindfully—with attention to timing, portion size, and smart food pairings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mango is not off-limits for people with diabetes. It has a low glycemic index, is rich in fibre, and contains valuable antioxidants and vitamins. The key is moderation: start with small portions, monitor your blood sugar response, and pair mango with protein or healthy fats to reduce its glycaemic impact. Always consult a healthcare provider or dietitian before making dietary changes, especially if you have blood sugar issues. With the right approach, mango can be a delicious and health-supportive addition to a diabetes-friendly diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="strong" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Also Read:  This blood test can predict heart attack risk, and it’s not cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 08:44:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwJBVV95cUxQRHZGMFlmV01BN0FNbWZnYXRZM3dJdFFOOElybkNldUtDb0RITXFWS0ZOaW8wUGJjaUxUTzNiUGVCZm92MkNyQ3d4MjlueDY5VW1uTmh0djFfeEh4YU5yTmNkdVZ0VjR4bV92ZGhiVHNWQUtCY0ZDck9aYzVmTGdqSnlEcy1Gd1JQdXBQSFNKQ05fYTJodmhhUzhjcVlOTzdKTEZzQ1pCb2pBSFFCbmtHaVVZRkJFVDZSaVpYTTlPdXpsdFdtTzk3NHJkOTktVWZ3Y1ZwUzFkUGZwSWU5TTRwckRxa2g1dFBTRm01c0YwanFNRW9POGZEempGdElkSHRDTzMyUENzYw</guid></item><item><title>世卫组织推荐使用注射用来那卡帕韦预防艾滋病毒-世界卫生组织（世卫组织） | WHO recommends injectable lenacapavir for HIV prevention - World Health Organization (WHO)</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxONkR6TDNqc0I5UjVrTnUtUTByODBpN2tWdWctWDFWTVROV1Q5Qmx5cUZmcHFGWGljNElnZkNPLUZCSDJ3U2E0N0R6a0ljZFNhbEJkS25LLW5OR0tJV2tZZjR5aGU5bTRsN2hOcF9uU0JUY1VzWEVVZlhoOGZUdVVCRjF6clNoWXd2SDM0em94YVhBQ0RYeFBxcERDeDh0UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) released today &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/9789240111608"&gt;new guidelines recommending the use of injectable lenacapavir (LEN)&lt;/a&gt; twice a year as an additional pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) option for HIV prevention, in a landmark policy action that could help reshape the global HIV response. The guidelines are being issued at the 13th International AIDS Society Conference (IAS 2025) on HIV Science, in Kigali, Rwanda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LEN, the first twice-yearly injectable PrEP product, offers a highly effective, long-acting alternative to daily oral pills and other shorter-acting options. With just two doses per year, LEN is a transformative step forward in protecting people at risk of HIV – particularly those who face challenges with daily adherence, stigma, or access to health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While an HIV vaccine remains elusive, lenacapavir is the next best thing: a long-acting antiretroviral shown in trials to prevent almost all HIV infections among those at risk," said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “The launch of WHO’s new guidelines, alongside the FDA’s recent approval, marks a critical step forward in expanding access to this powerful tool. WHO is committed to working with countries and partners to ensure this innovation reaches communities as quickly and safely as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines come at a critical moment as HIV prevention efforts stagnate with 1.3 million new HIV infections occurring in 2024 – with disproportionate impact among key and priority populations, including sex workers, men who have sex with men, transgender people, people who inject drugs, people in prisons, and children and adolescents. WHO’s recommendation on LEN signals a decisive move to expand and diversify HIV prevention, giving people more options to take control over their health with choices that fit their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Simplified testing: a major barrier removed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of these guidelines, WHO has recommended a public health approach to HIV testing using HIV rapid tests to support delivery of long-acting injectable PrEP, including LEN and cabotegravir (CAB-LA). The simplified testing recommendation removes a major access barrier by eliminating complex, costly procedures and enabling community-based delivery of long-acting PrEP through pharmacies, clinics, and tele-health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Next steps: call for implementation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;LEN joins other WHO-recommended PrEP options, including daily oral PrEP, injectable cabotegravir and the dapivirine vaginal ring, as part of a growing arsenal of tools to end the HIV epidemic. While access to LEN outside clinical trials remains limited at the moment, WHO urges governments, donors and global health partners to begin rolling out LEN immediately within national combination HIV prevention programmes – while collecting essential data on uptake, adherence and real-world impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additional WHO recommendations at IAS 2025&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, WHO’s &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/B09471-eng"&gt;treatment guidelines&lt;/a&gt; include a clear recommendation for the use of long-acting injectable cabotegravir and rilpivirine (CAB/RPV) as an alternative switching option for antiretroviral therapy (ART) for adults and adolescents who have achieved full viral suppression on oral ART and do not have active hepatitis B infection. This approach is designed to support people living with HIV facing adherence challenges to oral regimens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Updated guidelines on service delivery integration include recommendations to integrate HIV services with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as hypertension and diabetes, as well as mental health care for depression, anxiety and alcohol use disorders into HIV services, alongside interventions to support ART adherence. Additionally, new guidelines on &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/9789240104907"&gt;management of asymptomatic STIs recommend screening of gonorrhoea and/or chlamydia in key and priority populations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people living with HIV who have &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/B09434"&gt;mpox&lt;/a&gt; and are either ART naive or have experienced prolonged ART interruption, rapid initiation of ART is strongly recommended. Additionally, early HIV testing is advised for individuals presenting with suspected or confirmed mpox infection. &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/B09434"&gt;WHO’s standard operating procedures&lt;/a&gt; further emphasize HIV and syphilis testing for all individuals with suspected or confirmed mpox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the broader challenges facing HIV programmes, WHO has also issued new &lt;a href="/publications/i/item/9789240112759"&gt;operational guidance&lt;/a&gt; on sustaining priority HIV services in a changing funding landscape. The guidance aims to provide a stepwise framework to help countries prioritize services, assess risks, monitor disruptions, and adapt systems to protect health outcomes and preserve progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have the tools and the knowledge to end AIDS as a public health problem,” said Dr Meg Doherty, Director of WHO’s Department of Global HIV, Hepatitis and STI Programmes and incoming Director of Science, Research, Evidence and Quality for Health. “What we need now is bold implementation of these recommendations, grounded in equity and powered by communities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HIV remains a major global public health issue. By the end of 2024, an estimated 40.8 million people were living with HIV with an estimated 65% in the WHO African Region. Approximately 630 000 people died from HIV-related causes globally, and an estimated 1.3 million people acquired HIV, including 120 000 children. Access to ART continues to expand, with 31.6 million people receiving treatment in 2024, up from 30.3 million in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a time of reduced funding for HIV and health, WHO’s new and updated guidelines offer practical, evidence-based strategies to sustain momentum. By expanding prevention and treatment options, simplifying service delivery and promoting integration with broader health services, they support more efficient, equitable, and resilient HIV responses. Now is the moment for bold implementation to ensure these gains translate into real-world impact.&lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Note to the editor&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHO at the 13th IAS Conference on HIV Science&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IAS 2025, the&lt;a href="https://www.iasociety.org/conferences/ias2025" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;13th IAS Conference on HIV Science&lt;/a&gt; is being held in Kigali from 13 to 17 July 2025. It is the world’s most influential meeting on HIV research and its applications. This biennial conference presents the critical advances in basic, clinical and operational HIV research that move science into policy and practice. Through its programme, the meeting sets the gold standard of HIV science, featuring highly diverse and cutting-edge research. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At IAS 2025, WHO will present new normative guidance through key satellite sessions and engage at the highest level to highlight innovations and promote health equity, while sounding the alarm on the risks posed by declining global health funding. Detailed information on WHO at the conference is &lt;a href="/news-room/events/detail/2025/07/13/default-calendar/who-at-ias-2025"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            The World Health Organization is now recommending that countries include an HIV drug newly approved for prevention, lenacapavir, as a tool in their efforts to fight HIV infections – especially for groups most at risk and in areas where the burden of HIV remains high.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d00013b6n6xdo5c18@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://programme.ias2025.org/Programme/Session/202" target="_blank"&gt;global recommendation&lt;/a&gt; – issued Monday at the International AIDS Conference in Kigali, Rwanda – comes about a month after the US Food and Drug Administration approved lenacapavir as a twice-yearly injection for the prevention of the human immunodeficiency virus or HIV. Lenacapavir had been approved in 2022 to treat certain HIV infections and, in trials for prevention, it&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;was found to dramatically reduce the risk of infection and provide almost total protection against HIV.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d00033b6nc6niv3x3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These new recommendations are designed for real-world use. WHO is working closely with countries and partners to support the implementation,” Dr. Meg Doherty, director of WHO’s Department of Global HIV, Hepatitis and Sexually Transmitted Infections Programmes, said in a news briefing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d00043b6n9h2bxakw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The first recommendation is that a long-acting injectable, lenacapavir, should be offered as an additional prevention choice for people at risk for HIV and as part of combination prevention. With that, we call it a strong recommendation with moderate to high certainty of the evidence,” Doherty said. The second recommendation in the guidelines is that rapid diagnostic tests like at-home tests can be used to screen someone for HIV when they are starting, continuing or stopping long-acting medication to prevent infection – called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d00053b6nmrqu0gnt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            HIV spreads primarily through unprotected sex or sharing needles. It attacks the body’s immune system, and without treatment, it can lead to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS. Globally, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/hiv-aids" target="_blank"&gt;about 40 million people were living with HIV&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2023, according to WHO.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d00063b6ngrqsd2xz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            PrEP has been used to prevent HIV infections for years. In the United States, this may involve taking pills, such as a daily medication called Truvada, or getting injections, such as every two months of the medication Apretude.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d00073b6n19o4g4ut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But twice-yearly injections of lenacapavir, or LEN, have become another option in the prevention toolbox – not just for the United States but for the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d00083b6n4qm4m7f6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “LEN is a six-monthly injectable option, and it may be particularly attractive for people who prefer fewer clinic visits or have challenges with daily oral PrEP. … It could improve adherence and reach more people who need HIV prevention and can be used in pregnant and breastfeeding women,” Doherty said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d00093b6nywpmrx3e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “WHO is providing technical assistance to countries interested in adopting LEN and simplified testing strategies, in coordination with global partners like the Global Fund, UNAIDS and several other partners and donors,” she said. “We call on governments, funders, implementers and civil society to work together for implementing and integrating LEN into the HIV programs. And we believe time to act is now.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            There has been growing concern around funding for global HIV prevention efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000c3b6nho3k73bv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            International assistance accounts for 80% of prevention programs in low- and middle-income countries, according to the United Nations. But in the past six months, the United States has significantly withdrawn funding for much of its foreign assistance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The Trump administration has &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/30/politics/bush-obama-trump-usaid"&gt;dismantled the US Agency for International Development&lt;/a&gt;, or USAID, and reduced funding for the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/about-us-pepfar" target="_blank"&gt;PEPFAR&lt;/a&gt;, which acts as the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease in history.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Gilead Sciences, maker of lenacapavir, announced Wednesday that it has reached an agreement with the nonprofit Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to supply lenacapavir for HIV prevention at no profit to the company. Under this agreement, Gilead’s pricing reflects only the cost of producing and delivering lenacapavir.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000f3b6n7mn6vimf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are providing the medicine at no profit to Gilead, and in enough supply to reach up to two million people in low- and lower-middle-income countries ahead of generic lenacapavir becoming available,” Gilead Chairman and CEO Daniel O’Day &lt;a href="https://www.gilead.com/news/news-details/2025/gilead-finalizes-agreement-with-the-global-fund-to-accelerate-access-to-twice-yearly-lenacapavir-for-hiv-prevention-for-up-to-two-million-people-in-primarily-low--and-lower-middle-income-countries" target="_blank"&gt;said in a news release&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000g3b6n7uctffwp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The company added that the cost of lenacapavir under this agreement remains confidential.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000h3b6nlwm1wypb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the United States, the only place where lenacapavir has received approval for HIV prevention&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;so far, the drug has an annual list price of $28,218 when used for HIV prevention. The cost is similar to the price of other prevention medicine options, according to Gilead.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000i3b6nt16k9mgc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lenacapavir can “fundamentally change the trajectory of the HIV epidemic,” but only if it reaches the people who need it most, Peter Sands, executive director of the Global Fund, said in the news release.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000j3b6nfhoe3oo6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our ambition is to reach 2 million people with long-acting PrEP. But we can only do that if the world steps up with the resources required,” he said. “This is a pivotal moment — not just for the fight against HIV, but for the fundamental principle that lifesaving innovations must reach those who need them most — whoever they are, and wherever they live.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000l3b6nzj2h4j4i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/UNAIDS-global-AIDS-update-2025" target="_blank"&gt;United Nations warned in a report&lt;/a&gt; released Thursday that millions more people could die from HIV-related causes by 2029 if funding for HIV programs permanently disappears.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000m3b6n7x0a95fr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among the 60 low- and middle-income countries included in the report, 25 have indicated increasing their domestic budgets for HIV response efforts next year. But the report noted that may not be sufficient to replace the scale of international funding that these countries have been heavily reliant on.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000n3b6np0qd0tbe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We know that PEPFAR had committed $4.3 billion to over 50 countries &lt;a href="https://2021-2025.state.gov/pepfar-world-aids-day-2023/update-on-pepfars-programming-budget-for-2024-2025/" target="_blank"&gt;in 2025&lt;/a&gt;, and that support was suddenly ended in January of 2025,” Mary Mahy, director of &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/aboutunaids/unaidsleadership/bios/mary-mahy" target="_blank"&gt;UNAIDS’s Data for Impact&lt;/a&gt; department, said in a news briefing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000o3b6n698i8lji@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If none of the PEPFAR funding is replaced, we’d expect something like 4 million additional deaths between 2025 and 2029, and another 6 million additional new infections,” she said. “We also know that drug resistance would likely occur with some of those people going off treatment.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000q3b6nm8y8s3lx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some countries already have seen effects of the rollback of funding for HIV programs, according to Mahy. In Nigeria, facilities reported that there were about 40,000 people who received PrEP at least once during the later part of last year. That number dropped to fewer than 7,000 in April, &lt;a href="https://aidsinfo.unaids.org/services" target="_blank"&gt;according to UNAIDS data&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000r3b6nwqah161l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A similar trend emerged in Kenya, where there has been a decline in the number of women living with HIV who recently gave birth&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and received medications to reduce their risk of transmitting the virus to their newborns. About 3,000 women already received medications and nearly 900 initiated medications in October 2024, but those numbers fell to only about 300 already receiving and 100 starting medications in April.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000s3b6necbfw9yb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is not just a funding gap — it’s a ticking time bomb. … We have seen services vanish overnight. Health workers have been sent home. And people — especially children and key populations — are being pushed out of care,” UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/pressreleaseandstatementarchive/2025/july/20250710_global-aids-update?c" target="_blank"&gt;said in a news release Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcz6o04d000t3b6no0kvmgs8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is still time to transform this crisis into an opportunity,” Byanyima said. “Countries are stepping up with domestic funding. Communities are showing what works. We now need global solidarity to match their courage and resilience,”
    &lt;/p&gt;

The study analysed people born between 2008 and 2017 and estimated that 15.6 million individuals globally from this generation are at risk of developing gastric cancer in their lifetime. Worryingly, almost two-thirds of these cases will occur in Asia, largely due to high population numbers and ongoing exposure to risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;India and China could see 6.5 million gastric cancer cases combined&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study highlights that India and China together could account for approximately 6.5 million new gastric cancer cases in the coming decades. This projection positions Asia as the global hotspot for the disease. The rise is largely driven by factors such as rapid population growth, increasing life expectancy, and a continued prevalence of key risk factors—many of which are still not adequately addressed through public health measures. These include poor sanitation, limited access to healthcare, and dietary habits that may increase stomach cancer risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say this could make gastric cancer one of India’s biggest future health crises if timely action is not taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="24374347" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="Helicobacter-pylori-infection" source="keywords"&gt;Helicobacter pylori infection&lt;/keyword&gt; causes most gastric cancer cases in India&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most important takeaways from the study is that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the leading cause of future gastric cancer cases—accounting for about 76% of them. This bacterium infects the lining of the stomach and can remain undetected for years. Over time, it causes inflammation that can lead to ulcers and eventually cancer. In India, where access to preventive screening is limited and awareness is low, H. pylori often goes untreated, significantly raising the risk of long-term health complications. The study urges stronger surveillance and early intervention programmes to tackle this hidden epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gastric cancer is rising in India faster than in many regions&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, gastric cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide, but its burden is not evenly distributed. While some regions, like Sub-Saharan Africa, report relatively low incidence rates today, the study warns of a six-fold increase in cases in those areas over time. In contrast, India’s numbers are expected to rise more sharply and sooner due to existing health inequalities, limited diagnostic infrastructure, and lack of widespread awareness about early symptoms. This puts millions of Indians at a heightened and preventable risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Early detection could prevent most gastric cancer cases&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research points to a clear solution: early screening and treatment of H. pylori can dramatically reduce future cases of gastric cancer—by as much as 75%. In countries like India, where healthcare resources may be stretched, focusing on population-wide, low-cost screening initiatives could be a game-changer. Treating H. pylori with antibiotics and simple follow-up care could save countless lives and significantly ease the burden on the healthcare system. These preventive steps are not only scientifically sound but also financially viable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Younger populations in India face rising gastric cancer risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most alarming finding from the study is that gastric cancer is increasingly affecting younger individuals, especially those born after 2008. This is a major shift from previous decades when the disease primarily affected older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined with India’s ageing population, this trend could create a dual burden of both young and elderly patients requiring long-term cancer care. Without timely intervention, India risks reversing years of public health progress in cancer control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;India must take public health action against gastric cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce its future gastric cancer burden, India needs to adopt a multi-pronged public health strategy. The study recommends:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nationwide screening campaigns to detect and treat H. pylori early&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Public education initiatives to raise awareness of gastric cancer symptoms, such as persistent indigestion, bloating, and unexplained weight loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strengthening diagnostic infrastructure, especially in rural areas where healthcare access is limited&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Promoting healthy dietary and lifestyle habits, such as reducing salt-preserved foods, stopping tobacco use, and increasing intake of fruits and vegetables&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These actions are essential not only to control gastric cancer rates but also to build long-term resilience in India’s public health system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With projections estimating over 1.6 million new gastric cancer cases in India alone, the country is at a crossroads. The study’s findings are a powerful reminder that prevention is not just possible—it is necessary.

&lt;p&gt;Lately, more and more people are becoming aware that 10,000 steps is no longer the gold standard — it was actually a very successful and slightly misleading marketing campaign that gathered a lot of momentum fast and had people checking the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html"&gt;best fitness trackers&lt;/a&gt; regularly during walks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some research has suggested that 7,000 steps is enough to keep you happy and healthy, a meta-analysis from 2022 published in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00302-9/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00302-9/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;The Lancet&lt;/a&gt; found you can still achieve health benefits for less, and age could determine how many steps per day you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s everything you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-the-study"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is the study?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty/stevecoleimages)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meta-analysis assessed 15 studies — seven published and eight unpublished — and found that more steps were associated with lower mortality risk; the results plateaued at between 6,000-8,000 for adults aged 60 and over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For younger adults aged below 60, results plateaued at 8,000 to 10,000. In this study, researchers found “inconsistent evidence” that step intensity was associated with mortality beyond step volume. This suggests a “curvilinear association and range” in daily steps and all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, another study published in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/12/776.abstract" target="_blank" data-url="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/52/12/776.abstract" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;BMJ&lt;/a&gt; found that your cadence can matter — a pace of 100 steps per minute could be classified as moderate-intensity exercise and boost your cardiovascular fitness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while we can clearly see there’s a range you should aim for, according to your age, is there a minimum?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-4zcqgyDGKvDnVKa5D6aRPg" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-4zcqgyDGKvDnVKa5D6aRPg slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023 meta-analysis suggests there is: 2337 for cardiovascular mortality and 3867 for all-cause mortality. The study, published in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37555441/" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37555441/" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;European Journal of Preventive Cardiology&lt;/a&gt;, assessed over 226,000 participants to determine the minimum figure we should be aiming to reach each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, anything fewer than roughly 2,300 per day could increase your risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke or heart disease. And as your step count increases, your risk could decrease over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-should-you-increase-your-step-count"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Should you increase your step count?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you find you’re short on time,&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/these-3-walking-workouts-boost-your-metabolism-and-build-lower-body-strength" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/these-3-walking-workouts-boost-your-metabolism-and-build-lower-body-strength"&gt; walking workouts&lt;/a&gt; can help you reach the minimum number of steps. It’s also worth learning about a process called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/non-exercise-activity-thermogenesis-why-neat-could-help-you-burn-more-calories" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/non-exercise-activity-thermogenesis-why-neat-could-help-you-burn-more-calories"&gt;NEAT&lt;/a&gt;, which stands for “Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis,” and basically accounts for all activity and energy expenditure you can achieve outside of eating, sleeping and dedicated workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of playing with your kids, carrying groceries, or using one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-standing-desks" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-standing-desks"&gt;best standing desks&lt;/a&gt; during your workday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same 2023 meta-analysis found that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-doubled-my-step-count-every-day-for-2-weeks-heres-what-happened" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-doubled-my-step-count-every-day-for-2-weeks-heres-what-happened"&gt;increasing your step count&lt;/a&gt; could lead to better health. A 1,000-step increment decreased the risk of all-cause mortality by 15%, while a 500-step increment decreased the cardiovascular risk of mortality by 7%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, though, the universal exercise guidelines currently recommend a minimum of 150 minutes of aerobic activity per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking, particularly in nature, has been associated with boosted mood and creativity, reduced anxiety and fewer feelings of depression. And as we know, walking counts toward aerobic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activities such as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/color-walking-is-trending-heres-everything-you-need-to-know" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/color-walking-is-trending-heres-everything-you-need-to-know"&gt;color walking&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-swapped-my-regular-walks-for-intuitive-walking-and-i-cant-believe-i-havent-tried-it-sooner" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-swapped-my-regular-walks-for-intuitive-walking-and-i-cant-believe-i-havent-tried-it-sooner"&gt; intuitive walking&lt;/a&gt; can also boost your step count without feeling like a workout, so I recommend giving these a try if you’re short on steps for your age range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your daily step count doesn’t need to be achieved all in one go, so if you consider a 5k walk might take you over one hour (and roughly 6,000-7,500 steps), then you could break this up into manageable chunks during your day.

This causes me constant and extreme face pain, like a vise-grip on my face. Once an MRI confirmed no brain issues, and after multiple medications including Botox injections, I was put on nortriptyline, which immensely improved the pain. I am 61 years old and currently on 50 mg of nortriptyline, which brought my pain level from a constant 8 to a 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;After reading your recent column regarding amitriptyline and memory issues, I confirmed that nortriptyline could cause the same issues. I have noticed some minimal memory recall issues after being on this drug for a year. Since no other drug provided any substantial relief (including gabapentin), I believe I will be taking this long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Is there any over-the-counter medicine or any other meds that can counteract the memory side effects of this drug? Also, are you aware of any other successful new treatments for atypical trigeminal neuralgia? I have researched and tried most of the suggested online treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— A.M.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear A.M.:&lt;/strong&gt; Having spoken with many people with trigeminal neuralgia (a facial pain syndrome), I can confirm that the "textbook" case is probably the atypical one. There are many variations of trigeminal neuralgia, and the fact that you had such good relief with nortriptyline is highly suggestive that you do have a nerve-related facial pain syndrome. Although the pain is often intermittent, sometimes the pain can be continuous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Before making recommendations for changing medications, I want to be sure you understand that you don't have to change if you don't want to. Not everybody gets complete relief of pain from an 8 to a 0, and you may decide that it's worth the memory issues to stay on nortriptyline. It's unlikely that the memory problems will get worse if they're really due to nortriptyline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Since I don't know which other treatments you've had, I'm sorry if I recommend something that hasn't worked for you. What works really well for one person may not help another. Still, carbamazepine has become the first choice for many experts in the treatment of this painful condition. People with East or South Asian ancestry should consider genetic testing prior to starting this medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Advanced imaging (MRI with MRA, or magnetic resonance angiography) sometimes shows a blood vessel that is compressing the trigeminal nerve. I don't know if you had the ideal imaging protocol, and a second opinion may be warranted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Consideration of surgery is warranted if this is seen, although this is not a guarantee of success nor that the success will be permanent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Many of my readers have found benefit from the Facial Pain Association at FacePain.org. They can also help you find experts near you to discuss treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; I take Centella asiatica and pycnogenol to help prevent heart disease. Are these effective?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— A.N.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear A.N.:&lt;/strong&gt; Neither Gotu kola (Centella asiatica) nor pycnogenol (maritime pine bark extract) have been proven to reduce the risk of heart disease. Small studies have suggested some benefit in lowering sugar levels, for example, and helping certain eye damage in people with diabetes. But a well-done review didn't find a benefit in reducing the main drivers of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It is possible that these treatments are effective, but there is not strong enough evidence for me to recommend them. You could better spend the money needed for these supplements on a healthy diet.&lt;em&gt; Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 04:02:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0gFBVV95cUxQdW1VXzN0d3pyOUxYQW5IMW9sV0lvRHYxXy13bmlmYzhtWWZfaGEyZE5uMEVoTFVZX3Y0MEJvbTFFM1dHWUYxSzRHTlYwMktzSHQ0dk9UX2o1dlR2ZWZiVVY2Mlk5R3BmajktRnZ2S2dtU0syNmd0Tk83ZFpMdjM3RWgzRmhRRDNIYUgwdlZoSkVOLUwyenkyck1uSHVoeTNGeU1NX01UcUYycWg5cWRHVWpncDM0bWpxMUNFY2tHVklpcmNQV1FjM3Z5UmVXeE9WQWc</guid></item><item><title>婴幼儿尼古丁袋中毒飙升- NBC新闻 | Nicotine pouch poisonings soar in babies and toddlers - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxQVmV5Q0I4dGV6dmJiOVRZM1Nmd0RDRHE1c0pJaTdUZm84OGFPN2dwdER3MWRxNk1ac2NJY0IxVkhCUnY5NHJjQW00V0lmbVFjNDM0blhoUFpXYXVxMVZGTkxCN19FUkd5TmFhSUJRaGVQTVQzQUFRQk5OY21qQTl2MkdwbE1HLVVCRGFZNGZnMjdEZEhZWUlzR2hfNUEtSWRBeUhPYVhFVmJaTnJy0gFWQVVfeXFMTVVfQWI4eGxrT1N0Z0w1ZmdRZDc1WDFJRGZldXJwTDloRGszRWl1ay0tZklyTlNFVUhTaENia3R1MExzX0VRZVFpWEVwYjY5ejN6UDZvaGc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-16e564" class="body-graf"&gt;The number of young children sickened after getting their little hands on nicotine products like pouches and vape e-liquids has skyrocketed in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-361c01" class="body-graf"&gt;From 2010 through 2023, U.S. poison centers reported 134,663 cases of nicotine poisonings among kids under age 6, according to a study&lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/online-first" target="_blank"&gt;

wildly popular Zyn&lt;/a&gt;, that are behind the most significant rise in accidental nicotine poisonings among young kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-06454a" class="body-graf"&gt;The new research found that the rate of poisonings involving nicotine pouches among kids under 6 rose from 0.48 per 100,000 children in 2020 to 4.14 per 100,000 in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4a0f75" class="body-graf"&gt;That’s an increase of 763% in just three years — a startling finding that correlates with a surge in sales of nicotine pouches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b03682" class="body-graf"&gt;Nicotine pouches — which users tuck between their lip and gum and later discard — can contain as much as 6 milligrams of nicotine, a stimulant, and have been promoted as tobacco-free, spit-free and hands-free alternatives to cigarettes and chewing tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2e1abe" class="body-graf"&gt;They are not, however, approved by the Food and Drug Administration as nicotine replacement products used to help quit smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7d195d" class="body-graf"&gt;A&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2782874" target="_blank"&gt; 2021 study&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Office on Smoking and Health (one of several&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hhs-cut-quit-smoking-programs-tips-cdc-fda-rcna199251" target="_blank"&gt; public health groups dismantled under the Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;) found that sales of nicotine pouches rose dramatically in the past decade, from $709,000 in 2016 to $216 million by mid-2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a7d634" class="body-graf"&gt;“It was just a matter of time before they fell into the hands of younger kids,” said Dr. Molly O’Shea, a Michigan pediatrician and spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics. “It’s unfortunate, but not shocking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-7c79a4" class="body-heading"&gt;Why is nicotine toxic to little kids?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e3c2f6" class="body-graf"&gt;Nicotine is a chemical that’s highly toxic and could easily exceed a fatal dose in small children, according to a &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00204-013-1127-0" target="_blank"&gt;2013 study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-03ea4d" class="body-graf"&gt;The chemical increases heart rate and blood pressure, and could lead to nausea, vomiting or even coma, the study authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f1d54f" class="body-graf"&gt;Most cases included in the new research weren’t serious enough to warrant medical attention. But 39 children had significant side effects, like trouble breathing and seizures, said Natalie Rine, an author of the new study and director of the Central Ohio Poison Center at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-51604c" class="body-graf"&gt;Most nicotine poisoning cases, 76%, were babies and toddlers under age 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ff8ee3" class="body-graf"&gt;Two children, a 1-year-old boy and another boy about a year and a half old, died after ingesting liquid nicotine used in vapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8f2baa" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s good that the majority of kids in the study actually did pretty well. Most kids had either minor symptoms or no symptoms and didn’t require any medical management,” Rine said. “But two deaths is a lot, especially for something considered a preventable death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-f607f3" class="body-heading"&gt;How to reduce nicotine poisonings in kids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c6943e" class="body-graf"&gt;Kids are curious by nature. Babies and toddlers in particular explore their worlds by putting things in their mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ef21ba" class="body-graf"&gt;And they’re masters at breaking into drawers and cabinets to find new “toys.” Canisters of nicotine pouches are not equipped with child-resistant packaging. They taste good, too. Mint and fruit flavors are almost always added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e39b78" class="body-graf"&gt;O’Shea said it’s critical that all nicotine products are placed far out of reach of children. “That doesn’t mean in your purse, in your back pocket or on the counter,” she said. “It means locked away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e0baa0" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s not just parents and other adult caregivers who must be mindful of their nicotine products. An &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2833331" target="_blank"&gt;April study&lt;/a&gt; from the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California found the use of nicotine pouches among high school students nearly doubled between 2023 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b33dc2" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s easy for a teenager to be using this product and have parents be unaware,” O’Shea said. “It’s important for parents to be talking with their teenagers about products like this and having open dialogue in a nonjudgmental way in order to ascertain any risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c7440e" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Rine also recommends adding the national poison control number to cellphones: 1-800-222-1222.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 04:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxQVmV5Q0I4dGV6dmJiOVRZM1Nmd0RDRHE1c0pJaTdUZm84OGFPN2dwdER3MWRxNk1ac2NJY0IxVkhCUnY5NHJjQW00V0lmbVFjNDM0blhoUFpXYXVxMVZGTkxCN19FUkd5TmFhSUJRaGVQTVQzQUFRQk5OY21qQTl2MkdwbE1HLVVCRGFZNGZnMjdEZEhZWUlzR2hfNUEtSWRBeUhPYVhFVmJaTnJy0gFWQVVfeXFMTVVfQWI4eGxrT1N0Z0w1ZmdRZDc1WDFJRGZldXJwTDloRGszRWl1ay0tZklyTlNFVUhTaENia3R1MExzX0VRZVFpWEVwYjY5ejN6UDZvaGc</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，随着尼古丁袋的受欢迎程度飙升，它们也对幼儿更多的中毒负责- CNN | As nicotine pouches’ popularity soars, they’re also responsible for more poisonings in young kids, study finds - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTE5fUFJLcDd5UVhfTTR5dWU5elFyZk5NV3EwdkNiakJ3My1kWEVwMHlOaDItcjhHZkNhSk9GMG5ZaWhDS2hxVGI3SE9iU0VTY2xQNzZxcVkxclZpRk10d05xQXJmNGQ0ZlZKdEdmVHVLdEtfM1pZbFRaNEh2WnHSAYIBQVVfeXFMTlNJY1h3czI4ZlNmTUJHX181eXJldVdfY2xuTDEzZ0JZWHlwT0NpRVRIYi1kbnEwN1lzcE0tQm1mdUZpeDlaTGFoOTktWmFHZERpRnh1TktvWG9oYXNScmYwOXNzQlQ1Z0ZkY0I2aW1Ib3lWUDZtbzZTQ3Nua01CZEhZUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Nicotine pouches are a fast-growing source of nicotine poisoning in young children, according to a new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmczibz1w00103b6ofqta467a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Ohio analyzed more than a decade’s worth of data, examining over 134,000 cases of children under 6 who accidentally ingested nicotine through products like vapes, gums, and lozenges. Most types of exposures fell after 2016. But one delivery method — nicotine pouches — shot up, rising more than 760% between 2020 and 2023.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmczibz1w00113b6of3d59bas@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a high-concentration nicotine product, and it tastes good,” said Dr. Natalie Rine, director of the Central Ohio Poison Center at Nationwide Children’s Hospital and co-author of the study, published Monday in the journal Pediatrics. “There’s nothing telling the kid, ‘this is bad, you should spit it out’ … and that’s where you get into trouble.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmczibz1w00123b6obwzorvqw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The miniature white packets that users tuck between their lip and gum hit US shelves in 2014. They don’t contain tobacco but are instead filled with nicotine, either synthetically or naturally derived, along with flavorings and sweeteners.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmczibz1w00133b6o0x7bknti@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The discreet, sweet and smokeless nature of nicotine pouches has raised concerns among public health advocates, who are closely watching their rising popularity among teens and young adults. They’ve become the second most-used nicotine product among young people, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The National Youth Tobacco Survey found that nicotine pouch use among teens doubled between 2021 and 2024.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmczibz1w00143b6odwibg2y4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, the overall user base remains small. Just 0.5% of Americans use nicotine pouches, compared with 9% who smoke cigarettes and 3% who vape or use e-cigarettes, according to US Census Bureau data.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmczibz1w00153b6o2ghfx3ff@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Levels of nicotine in pouches can vary from 3 to 12 milligrams per pouch. At their lowest doses, they deliver more of the stimulant than a cigarette, and even small amounts of nicotine can be dangerous for small children. Ingesting just 1 to 2 milligrams —  less than what’s inside a single regular-strength pouch — can cause nausea, vomiting and tremors, among other serious symptoms, according to the National Library of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmczibz1w00163b6olw7tpe53@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study found that nicotine pouches were associated with a 150% greater risk of serious medical effects and were twice as likely to lead to hospitalization than other smokeless nicotine products swallowed by children, like gums, lozenges, e-liquids, tablets and powders.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmczibz1w00173b6o72efvqd1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the vast majority of pediatric nicotine ingestions resulted in little to no harm, more than 1,600 children had serious medical outcomes, the study found. Two children died after ingesting liquid nicotine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmczibz1w00183b6o7fibp6m6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Rine recommends that parents avoid using nicotine pouches in front of children to keep them from imitating potentially risky adult behaviors. She also suggests keeping nicotine products physically out of kids’ reach and to have conversations with other caretakers, like babysitters and extended family, about doing the same.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmczibz1w00193b6owbnrgs1l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If a child may have ingested a nicotine pouch, Rine says, the best first step is to call Poison Control at 1-800-222-1222. Trained staff can guide caregivers based on a child’s symptoms and help them decide if emergency care is needed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Though age remains a risk factor for this cancer, recent studies are pointing to a troubling trend - millennials are facing rising rates of this deadly disease. A recent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjs/article/112/7/znaf102/8191209" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published in BJS found that compared to people born in 1950, those born in 1990 have twice the risk of developing colon cancer. Dr. Joseph Salhab, a Florida-based gastroenterologist, has spoken about the alarming rise in cases of colon cancer among young adults. The doctor has revealed five critical warning signs that should not be ignored. Early detection is key to successful treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Rectal bleeding&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Salhab said that rectal bleeding is one of the most alarming signs of colon cancer. If you notice blood in the stool or on toilet paper, it should not be dismissed. This can look either dark or bright red. While it may be caused by benign conditions like hemorrhoids, persistent or recurrent bleeding certainly requires immediate medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Childhood Cancer: Causes, Treatments &amp;amp; Cure: Expert Oncologist Speaks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Unexplained abdominal pain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belly pain should not be easily dismissed. If you have belly pain with no known cause, that doesn’t go away or hurts a lot, you should get it checked. Persistent abdominal discomfort that lingers despite changes in diet or lifestyle is a red flag. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pain may feel like cramping or bloating; however, it could be a subtle but critical indicator of colon cancer. If the discomfort lasts longer, talk to a healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Weakness or fatigue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeling tired all the time is not a good sign. Fatigue or weakness, even after proper rest could signal an underlying issue. People tend to dismiss this symptom, however, Dr. Salhab has waned that it could be a crucial &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DL0oiYPyaP7/?hl=en" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;sign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Young adults, who often lead busy lives, may attribute this to stress or lack of sleep. This could delay diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Changes in bowel habits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;How you poop matters. Changes in bowel habits, especially one that lasts more than a few weeks should raise concern. These changes could be either increased constipation, diarrhea, or even how often you poop. If these changes persist, you should talk to your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Shruti Haasan Reacts To Justin Bieber's Online Meltdowns| 'Planetary Mental Health In Shambles'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Other symptoms &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Salhab also listed some other early signs of colon cancer. These include unexplained weight loss, loss of appetite, night sweats, or recurring low-grade fevers. Though these symptoms may be due to other health issues, when combined, they could point to colon cancer. So it is important to get it checked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The incidence of GI cancers in adults younger than age 50 is rising globally. Ongoing research efforts investigating the biology of early-onset GI cancers are critical to developing more effective screening, prevention, and treatment strategies,” lead author Sara Char, of the above-mentioned research, said. Lifestyle factors such as poor diet, sedentary behavior, and obesity, along with genetic predispositions, may also contribute to the risk of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 03:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwJBVV95cUxNWjc2aDQzaHlla05GdVRXbWllS083UXNJellEVEVzTmYyRklYVnBlUzZDd3lmYU1LZUNCNV9qa3A5cmVoM0o4NHh0a1FXdmI5ak5fcGJCSnJIMFJvaURPQUJUb1QxMC1zLUJxbVFHRGdpdFAyTFpCUU84UTRSdnhVWHdyV0tFSWhRSm5OR0tkNjJKWHBac2pQemJPdFAzUlZPV0RtN1N5QUM3WHNZWVJFY2MwbF9yUVpfRGRqS1RHMTYtMWloSzVuMjBIQ2Z6QkJ0WnlQeUY1dThjMTJkQlRjQVg0NGlteU9lc0MxYlFkRXJHNHIzMHpaZWpaLW9mV1pINTVBODZMRQ</guid></item><item><title>梅毒感染急剧上升，女性感染人数最多- standardmedia.co.ke | Syphilis infections rise sharply with women most hit - standardmedia.co.ke</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwwFBVV95cUxOcXNkOTFCS0pLLXEyZzB5OWZsbUUteWJ6bTNNNmhDeWgtS0UzOGozWU9NZENua005Mlg0TWk3TmxJMXJ3XzZoYW9CWlBkRVA2anhIUXctQ3pqNWxzN2F1aTN0UUdNUnV3aDlJWUlSbGFXMklqOUlWX1puQ2pWc2w4UVdOTHpuRGNCZ3U2U1diV0FQU1EtSWI5bWwwcm5XQU53YUUyQmRHUndBOVVWUWJLcVU2Y3J3b1pEZXliM19CMHFiYmvSAcgBQVVfeXFMTnRtNkdRVUZXaVNIVWVGa0dWUnl2RTFTbXZuYlE0bU1veFNseWpsOGpWYk16RXFLaG1FZ3Y5WjZNdTVBWDkwbE1JSjcwbXZFR2ExMzN0REItb082SlZDUWROSHI1d2VPTUs3Mi1mUzJ1VzUxcUpQazZRd25zSE5IUFpGQWVIZHZOVkw4angyVUhXUlJ0WF9oV3ctQ21uc3liWXhQWjktbWw1czdxS0VoLS1DWGJFQlhDTHdhcHgxcUVDc09vVlhWVFQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="tbl_art"&gt;

&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;In 2024, 16 per cent of those infected with syphilis were women, yet &lt;a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/counties/article/2001478429/governments-asked-to-adopt-new-guidance-of-testing-stis"&gt;only nine per cent of them received treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Most of the women who tested positive for the sexually transmitted disease were identified during Antenatal Clinics (ANC), alongside HIV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;In 2024, for instance, the country registered a total of 1,766,099 pregnancies, among the 1,468,615 enrolled for ANC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Globally, at least eight million people were infected in 2022, including 700,000 infants who acquired the infection from their mothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;A NASCOP official, Frankline Sangok, said that although the number of syphilis infections is high, screening is not done optimally due to a lack of test kits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;“We have a problem with screening for syphilis because of a lack of kits for testing,” said Sangok during the release of preliminary findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Top counties in syphilis testing include Laikipia, Nyeri, Nakuru, Makueni, Uasin Gishu, Nyamira, Machakos, Kirinyaga, Kakamega, Homa Bay, and Kajiado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Others are Murang’a, Mombasa, Nyandarua, Nairobi, Kilifi, Kisii, Busia, and Bomet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;The disease presents a painless sore at the site of infection, while secondary syphilis may include a non-itchy rash—often on the palms and soles along with fever, swollen lymph nodes, and flu-like symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;According to the World Health Organisation, if a pregnant woman who is infected does not receive early and effective treatment, she can transmit the infection to her unborn infant, commonly known as congenital syphilis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Among interventions for optimal testing and treatment of the disease, according to NASCOP and UNAids, are addressing vulnerabilities and inequalities that sustain new infections and impede progress, tackling health barriers to quality services, ensuring supply chain sustainability, and building social capital and community intelligence to diagnose and treat syphilis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Amid dwindling donor support, the ministry is banking on leadership and alignment of resources with national priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;The report was released during a public-private partnership engagement meant to onboard all stakeholders in the elimination of syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Private hospitals are expected to help mobilise resources and share accurate data with the ministry for proper planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;LVCT Health representative, Patrick Oyaro, said there is a need to document data to support planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;“Data is key. There is no way you will plan appropriately without data. This shall help in procurement of commodities and treatment,” said Dr Oyaro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Meanwhile, three per cent of the Kenyan population has Hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Baringo County is leading in Hepatitis B cases at 12 per cent, followed by Migori and Turkana counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;The Head of Viral Hepatitis and Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) at NASCOP, Nazila Ganatra, said stigma greatly affects the eradication of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;“Lack of awareness and stigma are among the challenges derailing the elimination of Hepatitis,” Dr Ganatra said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Hepatitis is the &lt;a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/health-science/article/2001258135/donated-blood-has-hiv-syphilis-report-shows"&gt;inflammation of the liver&lt;/a&gt; and may present with pain or bloating of the belly, dark urine, fatigue, and general body weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Other symptoms include loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;If left untreated, it can damage vital organs including the kidneys and lungs, and beyond that, can lead to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;According to the expert, adherence to treatment can suppress the virus and prevent underlying health complications such as liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, and kidney failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Patients widely use tenofovir and lamivudine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Globally, at least 304 million people are living with hepatitis — 254 million of them afflicted by Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C affecting another 50 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Data from NASCOP shows that in Kenya, about 1.9 million people are infected with Hepatitis B and C viruses, with the majority (1.56 million) having Hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;An additional report by the Kenya Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (KENPHIA) 2018 estimates Hepatitis B prevalence at three per cent among the general population, and 4.7 per cent among people living with HIV/AIDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Ganatra noted that research is ongoing to establish the causes of increased cases in these regions, but said stigma significantly limits access to care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;The Ministry of Health, through NASCOP, has set up a unit to scale up awareness, screening, and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;“We want to create more awareness of the disease in the population because it is &lt;a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/health/health-science/article/2001494541/study-uncovers-overlooked-sexual-health-crisis-among-adults-over-50"&gt;treatable and preventable&lt;/a&gt;,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;Further, the ministry is working towards the elimination of mother-to-child transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="paragraph-style"&gt;“One of the agendas of elimination is ensuring that a mother attending ANC is tested for HIV, syphilis, and Hepatitis, for a comprehensive approach to disease reduction,” added Ganatra. &lt;/p&gt;
                                                            &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Emergency vaccination during outbreaks of diseases like cholera,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ebola" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73080" data-postid="167691" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Ebola&lt;/a&gt; and measles have over the past quarter-century reduced deaths from such illnesses by nearly 60 percent, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar number of infections are also believed to have been prevented, while billions of euros have been generated in estimated economic benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Gavi vaccine alliance, which backed the study, said it collaborated with researchers at Burnet Institute in Australia to provide the world's first look at the historical impact of emergency immunisation efforts on public health and global health security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/vaccines-have-saved-a-staggering-154-million-lives-in-the-last-50-years?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Vaccines Have Saved a Staggering 154 Million Lives in The Last 50 Years&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the first time, we are able to comprehensively quantify the benefit, in human and economic terms, of deploying vaccines against outbreaks of some of the deadliest infectious diseases," Gavi chief Sania Nishtar said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This study demonstrates clearly the power of vaccines as a cost-effective countermeasure to the increasing risk the world faces from outbreaks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published this week in the &lt;a href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/10/7/e016887"&gt;&lt;em&gt;British Medical Journal (BMJ) Global Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, examined 210 outbreaks of five infectious diseases – cholera, Ebola, measles, meningitis and yellow  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fever" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73066" data-postid="167691" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt; – in 49 lower-income countries between 2000 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine roll-outs in these settings had a dramatic impact, with the study showing they reduced both the number of infections and deaths by almost 60 percent across the five diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some of the diseases the effect was far more dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination was shown to decrease deaths during yellow fever outbreaks by a full 99 percent, and 76 percent for Ebola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, emergency vaccination significantly reduced the threat of outbreaks expanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also estimated that the immunisation efforts carried out during the 210 outbreaks generated nearly $32 billion in economic benefits just from averting deaths and years of life lost to disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That amount was however likely to be a significant underestimate of overall savings, it said, pointing out that it did not take into account outbreak response costs or the social and macro-economic impacts of disruptions created by large outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The massive Ebola outbreak that hit West Africa in 2014, before the existence of approved vaccines, for instance saw cases pop up worldwide and is estimated to have cost the West African countries alone more than $53 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167703" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167703" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ebola-vaccine-west-africa.jpg" alt="A health worker vaccinates a man who is sitting in a plastic chair. they are under an outdoor marquee, with many other peoples sitting around behind them. everyone is wearing face masks." class="wp-image-167703 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ebola-vaccine-west-africa.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ebola-vaccine-west-africa-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/ebola-vaccine-west-africa-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167703" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A health worker vaccinates a man in Abidjan on 17 August  2021 during a roll-out of vaccinations against Ebola, after the country recorded its first known case of the disease since 1994.

			&lt;p&gt;Significant brain defects known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiari_malformation"&gt;Chiari malformations&lt;/a&gt; could be down the genes some of us have inherited from  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/neanderthals" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73037" data-postid="167504" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Neanderthals&lt;/a&gt;, according to a new study, causing a mismatch between brain shape and skull shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study focuses on Chiari malformation type I (&lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/chiari-malformation-type-i"&gt;CM-I&lt;/a&gt;), where the lower part of the brain extends too far into the spinal cord – typically linked to having a smaller-than-normal &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occipital_bone"&gt;occipital bone&lt;/a&gt; at the back of the skull. It can lead to headaches, neck pain, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocephalus"&gt;more serious conditions&lt;/a&gt;, and is thought to affect &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2019.12.005"&gt;up to 1 in 100 people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several other ancient human species had different skull shapes to our own, and a previous study &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2013.07.035"&gt;published in 2013&lt;/a&gt; put forward the idea that interbreeding between &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; and these other hominins may be a root cause of Chiari malformation type I (CM-I), the mildest type of the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-really-killed-the-neanderthals-a-space-physicist-has-a-radical-idea?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;What Really Killed The Neanderthals? A Space Physicist Has a Radical Idea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a team led by osteoarchaeologist Kimberly Plomp from the University of the Philippines has tested this hypothesis. "The legacy of these interbreeding events can be identified in the genomes of many living humans," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/emph/eoaf009"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used 3D modeling and shape analysis techniques to compare 103 skulls of people today with and without CM-I, and 8 fossil skulls from ancient species, including &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_erectus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_heidelbergensis"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homo heidelbergensis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homo neanderthalensis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Neanderthals).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with CM-I had differences in skull shape, the analysis showed, including the area where the brain connects to the spine. However, these skull shapes weren't similar to all of the ancient hominins studied – only to Neanderthals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167507" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167507" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/SkullPoints.jpg" alt="Skull analysis diagram" class="wp-image-167507 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/SkullPoints.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/SkullPoints-600x323.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167507" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers examined the shapes of modern and ancient skulls. (Plomp et al., &lt;em&gt;Evol. Med. Public Health&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, skulls from &lt;em&gt;H. erectus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;H. heidelbergensis&lt;/em&gt; were more similar to the skulls of modern humans without CM-I. As a result, the researchers suggest the original hypothesis was too broad, and should be adapted to look specifically at &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/neanderthal-dna-exists-in-humans-but-one-piece-is-mysteriously-missing"&gt;Neanderthal links&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rather than the genes being traceable to &lt;em&gt;H. erectus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;H. heidelbergensis&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;H. neanderthalensis&lt;/em&gt;, our results are consistent with them being traceable just to &lt;em&gt;H. neanderthalensis&lt;/em&gt;," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/emph/eoaf009"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study team proposes a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/neanderthals" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73037" data-postid="167504" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Neanderthal&lt;/a&gt; Introgression Hypothesis to replace the one formed in 2013. It adds to a growing body of evidence around how early &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; and Neanderthals mingled, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/humans-and-neanderthals-had-a-longer-more-intertwined-relationship-than-we-thought"&gt;interbreeded&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dna-reveals-when-humans-and-neanderthals-became-one"&gt;exchanged genetic information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers are keen to expand the sample used in their analysis – in terms of both modern and ancient skulls, and across ages – which should tell us more about the relationship between CM-I skull structures and skulls in these early peoples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hypothesis also needs to be put to the test in groups of people from different parts of the world. We know that African populations have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/people-with-an-african-ancestry-also-have-a-few-neanderthal-genes-after-all"&gt;less Neanderthal DNA&lt;/a&gt; than populations in Europe and Asia, which should be reflected in cases of CM-I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, these findings and the techniques used to reach them could help inform ways of treating Chiari malformations or perhaps stopping them from happening in the first place – although it's likely there are several causes for the condition, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-genetic-risk-for-disease-can-be-changed-by-your-environment"&gt;including genetics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The methods would seem to have the potential to help us develop a deeper understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of Chiari malformations, which could in turn strengthen diagnosis and treatment of the condition," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/emph/eoaf009"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/emph/eoaf009"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

"The legacy of these interbreeding events can be identified in the genomes of many living humans," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/emph/eoaf009" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:write;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The researchers used 3D modeling and shape analysis techniques to compare 103 skulls of people today with and without CM-I, and 8 fossil skulls from ancient species, including &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_erectus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Homo erectus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homo erectus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_heidelbergensis" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Homo heidelbergensis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homo heidelbergensis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Homo neanderthalensis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;Homo neanderthalensis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Neanderthals).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People with CM-I had differences in skull shape, the analysis showed, including the area where the brain connects to the spine. However, these skull shapes weren't similar to all of the ancient hominins studied – only to Neanderthals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined the shapes of modern and ancient skulls.

As a result, the researchers suggest the original hypothesis was too broad, and should be adapted to look specifically at &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/neanderthal-dna-exists-in-humans-but-one-piece-is-mysteriously-missing" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Neanderthal links;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Neanderthal links&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Rather than the genes being traceable to &lt;em&gt;H. erectus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;H. heidelbergensis&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;H. neanderthalensis&lt;/em&gt;, our results are consistent with them being traceable just to &lt;em&gt;H. neanderthalensis&lt;/em&gt;," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/emph/eoaf009" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:write;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study team proposes a &lt;a class="link " href="https://www.sciencealert.com/neanderthals" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Neanderthal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Neanderthal&lt;/a&gt; Introgression Hypothesis to replace the one formed in 2013. It adds to a growing body of evidence around how early &lt;em&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/em&gt; and Neanderthals mingled, &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/humans-neanderthals-had-longer-more-180033304.html" data-ylk="slk:interbreeded;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;interbreeded&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/dna-reveals-humans-neanderthals-became-190029772.html" data-ylk="slk:exchanged genetic information;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;exchanged genetic information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Next, the researchers are keen to expand the sample used in their analysis – in terms of both modern and ancient skulls, and across ages – which should tell us more about the relationship between CM-I skull structures and skulls in these early peoples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The hypothesis also needs to be put to the test in groups of people from different parts of the world. We know that African populations have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/people-with-an-african-ancestry-also-have-a-few-neanderthal-genes-after-all" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:less Neanderthal DNA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;less Neanderthal DNA&lt;/a&gt; than populations in Europe and Asia, which should be reflected in cases of CM-I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Ultimately, these findings and the techniques used to reach them could help inform ways of treating Chiari malformations or perhaps stopping them from happening in the first place – although it's likely there are several causes for the condition, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-genetic-risk-for-disease-can-be-changed-by-your-environment" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:including genetics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;including genetics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The methods would seem to have the potential to help us develop a deeper understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of Chiari malformations, which could in turn strengthen diagnosis and treatment of the condition," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/emph/eoaf009" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:write;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/emph/eoaf009" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Related News&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 02:11:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxOeTd6bFBZbE0zTXlXb0V3Um1EUERHRjhRVDI5Z3J4QVVHdFlPQ3hudzgzQ1Rlal9ZWGE4VDFWOEtwMGFjZUlMRFFVWUFZb21VV2FXcUc4SWxtdG9PZDlaR3NGU2dobnljTUFEZ3k2Mzk3MTJOTkt1WWxZQ2h1Q3M0UEd1cWROdE0</guid></item><item><title>以色列研究人员开发出世界上第一种基于mRNA的抗细菌疫苗--《耶路撒冷邮报》 | Israeli researchers develop world's first mRNA-based vaccine against bacterium - The Jerusalem Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ0FVX3lxTFBoS09iVnpEWkl1V3VDdTR2MlIydmswc1lEVFBqc1UyN3l6SUlnLTBkRmx5dWgwQlRmYXptcHI4dVdKRnZLUWNCV3BFdmVaa3djdldLLTllMGFISTFzZUNrOUI4ZDhIZjQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="menu-title" role="button" aria-expanded="false" tabindex="0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM POST EN ESPANOL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="arrow "&gt;&lt;svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="none" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;path stroke="#CB133E" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="1.7" d="m5.335 13.333 5.333-5.334-5.333-5.333"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Jerusalem Post</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 02:10:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTFBoS09iVnpEWkl1V3VDdTR2MlIydmswc1lEVFBqc1UyN3l6SUlnLTBkRmx5dWgwQlRmYXptcHI4dVdKRnZLUWNCV3BFdmVaa3djdldLLTllMGFISTFzZUNrOUI4ZDhIZjQ</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，减少痴呆风险的首要食物- AOL.com | The #1 Food to Limit to Reduce Your Risk of Dementia, According to Dietitians - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTE1ydEZtRm53RV9NRUpXQ1VVc0MzY21JdGNKSXVyR3RmTkNBYVMxTTdDRnl4d0xuWGFqOU1FM3A3S1VaV2ZjVU1tVnQtVkVMNF9IM1AtcGxqUTlYNGlLVVgyalpSTDEzRWNXQXJB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviewed by Dietitian Jessica Ball, M.S., RD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Key Points&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limiting candy in your diet may support brain health, as high added sugar intake could increase the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brain-healthy lifestyle includes regular exercise, managing chronic diseases, staying socially engaged and following diets like the MIND diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making mindful dietary and lifestyle choices can enhance cognitive health and overall well-being over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 55 million people have dementia worldwide, with Alzheimer’s disease being the most common form, contributing to 60% to 70% of dementia cases. Having &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8009483/americans-adults-dementia-study-ways-to-reduce-your-risk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alzheimer’s disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; means living with a progressive disorder that causes brain cells to degenerate and die, leading to a continuous decline in memory, thinking skills and the ability to perform everyday tasks. Sadly, as the disease progresses, even basic activities and communication become challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several factors influence the risk of developing dementia, with some being completely beyond your control. Aging is the most significant risk factor, as individuals over the age of 65 are more susceptible. Genetics also play a crucial role, with specific genetic mutations directly linked to Alzheimer’s disease. However, along with unchangeable factors, certain lifestyle choices can help lower the risk of cognitive decline, with diet being a pivotal piece of the puzzle. “Some of the best foods for brain health are antioxidant-rich wild blueberries, salad greens for B vitamins, salmon for its anti-inflammatory fatty acids, fiber-rich black beans, and walnuts, the best source of plant-based omega-3 ALA among nuts,” says &lt;a href="https://maggiemoon.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Maggie Moon, M.S., RD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Maggie Moon, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;There are some foods you should avoid when focusing on brain health support too, with candy being the #1 food on that list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why You Should Limit Candy for Brain Health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking steps to reduce dementia risk is one positive step for brain health. While there isn’t one food that will cause dementia, high-added-sugar candy tops the list of foods that should be limited on a brain-healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Candies are not your brain’s friend,” Moon says. She points to a study that found that eating too much added sugar more than doubled the risk for dementia. “That includes added sugar from candies, as well as other sweets like pastries, sweetened café drinks and sodas,” she says. Researchers think that high blood sugar and insulin levels are risk factors for Alzheimer’s because insulin resistance may also occur in the brain, which may impact memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, everything can be eaten in moderation in a healthy, balanced eating plan. “While fine once in a while, research has found that a diet that is consistently high in added sugar may increase the amyloid plaque buildup in the brain,” says &lt;a href="https://www.lauramali.com/laura-ali-registered-dietitian-nutritionist/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Laura M. Ali, M.S., RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Laura M. Ali, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. "These plaques disrupt the communication system in our brain, and scientists have found that people with Alzheimer’s disease tend to have more of these plaques.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, says Ali, one study found that every 10 grams of added sugar consumed per day (equivalent to 2½ teaspoons of sugar or 8 gummy candies) was associated with a 1.3% to 1.4% increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Those with the highest daily added sugar intake had 19% higher odds of developing Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other Ways to Reduce Your Risk of Dementia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limiting sweetened candy doesn't guarantee that you won't get dementia, but it is a positive step forward. Along with limiting added sugar in your diet, here are some other ways to reduce your dementia risk:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise by participating in both aerobic activity and resistance exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you smoke cigarettes, take the first steps to quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limit alcohol intake. If you regularly drink alcohol, try to do so in moderation. Excessive drinking is linked to cognitive decline. Moderate drinking means two drinks or less in a day for men and one drink or less in a day for women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay socially engaged. Maintaining social connections builds your cognitive reserve to maintain good brain function with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have chronic diseases, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, make sure you’re managing these well. Stiffness in arteries and blood vessels can damage the brain. If you need help or individualized advice, reach out to a healthcare professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Include brain-healthy foods in your diet. The MIND diet emphasizes foods like whole grains, nuts, berries, vegetables and olive oil, which research shows may help support brain health. “The brain-healthy MIND diet limits foods high in saturated fats and added sugars because both are linked to oxidative stress, inflammation and the brain plaques and tangles associated with Alzheimer’s disease,” says Moon. She clarifies that this diet limits—but does not eliminate—fried foods, pastries and sweets, red meat, whole-fat cheese and butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our Expert Take&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing will guarantee that you will live a life free from dementia. But certain steps may help reduce your risk, with your dietary choices being one factor. And along with eating brain-healthy foods, limiting your candy intake can help keep you cognitively sharp. Enjoying a small handful of candy corn on Halloween or conversation hearts on Valentine’s Day won’t “cause” dementia. “It’s important to remember that no single food eaten once, or even once in a while, is going to make or break your brain health,” Moon adds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/food-to-limit-to-reduce-dementia-risk-11769343" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jul 2025 00:47:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE1ydEZtRm53RV9NRUpXQ1VVc0MzY21JdGNKSXVyR3RmTkNBYVMxTTdDRnl4d0xuWGFqOU1FM3A3S1VaV2ZjVU1tVnQtVkVMNF9IM1AtcGxqUTlYNGlLVVgyalpSTDEzRWNXQXJB</guid></item><item><title>对家长减少儿童食物过敏的一条建议- ScienceAlert | One Piece of Advice to Parents Slashed Food Allergies in Children - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxObXFJanNFZFVENWhVQWlNVExEX1Z1dDMyZVduWmxVYVRXdmhJdEdva2NtNVNRMmV0TXlDeXRRMWRBaHZfNmtzVHRqSE9Od1dfd0g0M0l6ei1zMGFjZm5LbWZXdkhfTGxVRzhOQ21XRGlKU2J2RG9wNHdmN2hZZ2pNU1IzT2ZuQm9pSUlRZDU5X3c5cDlEVkVnRGJB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;New research highlights a crucial time window very early on in life, during which the introduction of eggs and peanut butter into the diets of babies significantly reduces the chances of them &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-common-and-dangerous-allergens-doesn-t-appear-on-food-labels-in-the-us"&gt;becoming allergic&lt;/a&gt; to these foods later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings run counter to previous advice given to parents to avoid giving these foods to their kids until they're at least a year old over concerns that they might trigger allergic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, researchers led by a team from the University of Western Australia compared the experiences of two groups of children in Australia: 506 whose parents got no specific feeding advice, and 566 whose parents were advised to start adding eggs and peanut butter to the diets of the infants at around six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/skin-injuries-and-food-allergies-may-have-a-mysterious-connection?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Skin Injuries And Food Allergies May Have a Mysterious Connection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the babies in group two – whose caregivers followed the updated guidelines and introduced peanut butter and egg around six months of age – egg allergy reduced from 12 percent to 3 percent, and peanut allergy reduced from around 6 percent to 1 percent," &lt;a href="https://www.thekids.org.au/news--events/news-and-events-nav/2025/july/peanuts-and-eggs-reduces-allergy-risks/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Summer Walker, a health scientist at the University of Western Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, earlier introduction of these foods at the six-month mark made a notable difference to the number of kids who went on to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/immunotherapy-may-reduce-the-severity-of-peanut-allergy-reactions-says-new-study"&gt;develop allergies&lt;/a&gt; by 12 months of age. Cow's milk was also included, though here the difference was smaller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advice itself &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/introducing-peanuts-and-eggs-early-in-life-might-lead-to-less-allergies"&gt;isn't new&lt;/a&gt;, and the six-month milestone has in fact now been added to the official Infant Feeding and Allergy Prevention Guidelines proposed by the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA).

All the babies involved in the research had a close relative with an allergy to one of these foods, and allergies &lt;a href="https://acaai.org/allergies/allergies-101/who-gets-allergies/"&gt;often run in families&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some parents are still confused about when to introduce allergens – especially those families with a history of allergies," &lt;a href="https://www.thekids.org.au/news--events/news-and-events-nav/2025/july/peanuts-and-eggs-reduces-allergy-risks/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; research dietitian Debbie Palmer, from the University of Western Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://www.jaci-inpractice.org/article/S2213-2198(25)00592-6/fulltext"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

(AP)  — &lt;/span&gt;A resident of northern Arizona has died from pneumonic plague, health officials said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plague is rare to humans, with on average about seven cases reported annually in the U.S., most of them in the western states, according to federal health officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The death in Coconino County, which includes Flagstaff, was the first recorded death from pneumonic plague since 2007, local officials said. Further details including the identify of the victim were not released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;MORE | Disease Cases in Utah:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plague is a bacterial infection known for killing tens of millions in 14th century Europe. Today, it's easily treated with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bubonic plague is the most common form of the bacterial infection, which spreads naturally among rodents like prairie dogs and rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two other forms: septicemic plague that spreads through the whole body, and pneumonic plague that infects the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pneumonic plague is the most deadly and easiest to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bacteria is transmitted through the bites of infected fleas that can spread it between rodents, pets and humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People can also get plague through touching infected bodily fluids. Health experts recommend taking extra care when handling dead or sick animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most cases happen in rural areas of northern New Mexico, northern Arizona, southern Colorado, California, southern Oregon and far western Nevada, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;_____&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KUTV</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2025 21:52:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxOa0tCSWNSMzBmT292M3lZbmdvTENCQ052bDNsMUdSYlBXTzdvZUFBUm9jandGQk1KWnRZZml4anY0Mmpzb0ZkR3RTQmxkY0dxcUpINVg5T1RSTnVSM3d4MXZ0bnIwN0VvejhobzRvdEZHYXRINWZaVjZ6RWlNSTZwOXpHZEZKYlRweTZFRUo1V0U</guid></item><item><title>常见的基因突变大大增加了男性患痴呆症的风险- Earth.com | Common genetic mutation dramatically increases the risk of dementia in men - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxPeVhJQ2xhMkw1QmxsREFBcUpLSkgwY2NJQ2pleXFZYjR0S21nTFlmZEFOX0NTNHZiUDhJcS1iRDZRdlV0UHRGa1lGS1NFamtKX2JpRlozY1JHRjlFbEpoT1JIaDBVeHRlb2FNaDZKWjVSN09zRFlYQ1FrZG5GLVpTNzU5OTYtVkVtbUdSMTlaNm4tSnlMWmgydXRrTnNEbWFKaDBCTg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;About one man in 36 carries two copies of a tiny change in the HFE gene and that detail can more than double his odds of developing dementia, according to a new analysis of nearly 12,200 Australians and Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia already affects about 433,000 Australians, and while women still outnumber men, this fresh genetic signal shows that older males with the variant face a steeper climb toward memory loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-hfe-gene-men-and-dementia"&gt;HFE gene, men, and dementia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The haemochromatosis gene keeps the body’s iron traffic moving smoothly, yet its &lt;a href="https://www.haemochromatosis.org.uk/h63d-carrier-also-known-as-h63d-heterozygous" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;H63D version&lt;/a&gt; is anything but rare, turning up in one in three people as a single copy and in roughly one in 36 as a double hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;H63D does not usually overload the liver the way the better‑known &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC165699/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;C282Y variant&lt;/a&gt; can, but laboratory work shows that mutant HFE can upset cellular iron sensors and let free iron trigger damaging chemical reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-genes-iron-brains-and-memory"&gt;Genes, iron, brains and memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iron is vital but volatile, and when it piles up inside microglia, the brain’s immune cells, it sparks oxidative stress and inflammation tied to &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reviews of animal and human data echo the theme: iron dyshomeostasis fans reactive oxygen species, injures neurons, and may even set off ferroptosis, a specialized form of cell death linked to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HFE variants have also been linked to Parkinson’s disease and motor neuron disorders, suggesting that iron mismanagement may be a shared pathway across multiple brain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8661115/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that abnormal iron levels in regions like the substantia nigra and motor cortex are associated with earlier onset and faster progression of these diseases in genetically susceptible individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-aspree-data-revealed"&gt;What the ASPREE data revealed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://aspree.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The ASPREE trial&lt;/a&gt; followed 19,114 healthy seniors for a median 6.4 years to test low‑dose aspirin, generating a gold‑mine of aging data in the process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genome scans within ASPREE showed that men with two H63D copies logged an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.39 for incident &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/risk-of-dementia-is-much-higher-than-previously-thought/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, while women with the same genotype saw no extra risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having two copies of the variant more than doubled the risk of dementia in men, but not women,” &lt;a href="https://staffportal.curtin.edu.au/staff/profile/view/john-olynyk-6669ecca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor John Olynyk&lt;/a&gt;, of Curtin University Medical School, who co‑led the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-only-men"&gt;Why only men&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/girls-diets-strongly-influence-when-they-begin-puberty/"&gt;Menstruation&lt;/a&gt;, pregnancy, and lower mid‑life ferritin give women a natural outlet for iron, which may blunt the variant’s impact; haemochromatosis complications likewise appear later and milder in females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain‑imaging studies find that women who stop menstrual bleeding early accumulate more iron in deep brain regions, hinting that lifelong iron exposure could be the pivot that tips male brains toward damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sex hormones complicate matters too, because &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/heart-health-after-menopause-what-every-woman-should-know/"&gt;estrogen&lt;/a&gt; modulates iron metabolism and offers anti‑inflammatory benefits that may shield neural circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HFE analysis is already part of routine work‑ups when doctors suspect iron overload, but the new results suggest that broader screening in aging men could flag a hidden &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dementia-was-extremely-rare-in-ancient-times-so-why-is-it-now-so-prevalent/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; risk before symptoms start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying carriers is inexpensive, and unlike many predictive markers, this one points to an actionable pathway, iron handling and its downstream inflammatory effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-practical-steps-today"&gt;Practical steps today&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team found no clear link between blood ferritin levels and dementia, yet keeping iron in the normal range, treating chronic inflammation, staying active, and eating a plant‑biased diet all intersect with brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular physical activity alone can slash dementia risk by roughly 30 percent, according to &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/physical-activity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors also emphasize blood pressure control, smoking cessation, and social engagement, interventions that help every older adult, variant carrier or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/one-particular-sleep-stage-slow-wave-deep-is-most-important-for-preventing-dementia/"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; prevention efforts often rely on broad lifestyle advice or age thresholds, but this variant suggests a need for sex‑aware screening policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If men with double H63D copies truly carry double the risk, early genetic testing could steer them toward more aggressive prevention long before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-men-dementia-and-the-future"&gt;Men, dementia, and the future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/paul-lacaze" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Professor Paul Lacaze&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Monash University&lt;/a&gt;, hopes that untangling how H63D alters brain pathways will spark medicines that block the harm even when the gene cannot be changed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future work will track variant carriers with MRI iron mapping and fluid biomarkers to catch early inflammatory changes, then test whether diet, phlebotomy, or anti‑ferroptotic drugs can tilt the balance back toward healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetics rarely hands scientists such a common, sex‑specific clue, and this one arrives in time for a generation of men now crossing the 70‑year threshold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000213743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;
