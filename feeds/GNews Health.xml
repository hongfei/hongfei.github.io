The Santa Fe medical examiner announced that &lt;a href="https://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/omi-gene-hackman-died-of-heart-disease-in-santa-fe-wife-betsy-arakawa-had-hantavirus/article_f2eb0a38-f9d5-11ef-9e7d-9be7ad9c0090.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;Arakawa died from hantavirus&lt;/a&gt; and Hackman outlived her by up to a week before succumbing to heart disease and Alzheimer’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The identities of Mammoth Lakes residents was not made public as of Thursday, though public health officials referred to the latest victim as a “young adult.” Investigators found no evidence of mouse activity inside the person’s home, and it was unclear where they would have been exposed to rodent droppings or saliva. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three people contracted the illness in February while living in Mammoth Lakes, a town of 7,000 in the Sierra Nevada about 50 miles east of Yosemite National Park surrounded by ski areas and trails. Mono County health officials called their deaths “tragic and alarming.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing and circumstances of the deaths was atypical, said Dr. Tom Boo, Mono County public health officer. Hantavirus infections most commonly occur in the late spring or summer when people are exposed to the urine, droppings or saliva of wild rodents like deer mice — particularly by inhaling contaminants in the air. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As far as we know, none of these deceased individuals engaged in activities typically associated with exposure, such as cleaning out poorly ventilated indoor areas or outbuildings with a lot of mouse waste,” Boo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT1" data-large-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials believe that a boom in the deer mouse population may be to blame. Deer mouse numbers were “high this year in Mammoth and probably elsewhere in the Eastern Sierra,” increasing the likelihood of human infections, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boo said it was “crucial” that California residents take precautions such as trapping rodents, airing out enclosed spaces and keeping food in rodent-proof containers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incubation period following a hantavirus infection typically lasts weeks and usually begins as a flu-like illness. Symptoms can include fever, fatigue and muscle aches, then move on to headaches, dizziness, chills, abdominal problems, coughing and shortness of breath, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 1 in 3 people who contract the virus die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prompt diagnosis and treatment can increase a person’s chance of survival, but testing is “only available in specialized laboratories, making early recognition challenging,” health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="B300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;California is familiar with the deadly rodent-borne illness.

    &lt;p&gt;As members of the British Parliament debate proposed legislation that would allow medically assisted death for terminally ill adults in England and Wales, &lt;i&gt;BBC News&lt;/i&gt; published an article this week detailing one man’s experience with the process here in California. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thought-provoking piece — &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rgd4yrz3eo"&gt;linked here&lt;/a&gt; — tells the story of 80-year-old Wayne Hawkins, a former resident of Arcata, who, after suffering from chronic pain, heart failure and “a myriad of other health issues,” decided to pursue medical aid-in-dying, which was legalized in California through the End of Life Options Act of 2016. The law allows terminally ill adults with a life expectancy of six months or less and the mental capacity to make the choice to request medication that will hasten their death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Hawkins’ request was approved by two doctors, he invited&lt;i&gt; BBC News&lt;/i&gt; to his San Diego home to share his perspective on the controversial aid-in-dying process and observe his final day alongside his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Britain is pretty good with freedoms and this is just another one,” Hawkins told &lt;i&gt;BBC News&lt;/i&gt;. “People should be able to choose the time of their death as long as they meet the rules like six months to live or less.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While proponents of medically assisted death — often dubbed “death with dignity” — view the process as a compassionate option for people facing terminal illness and suffering, opponents argue that it is morally wrong. Dr. Vincent Nguyen, a palliative care specialist interviewed in the &lt;i&gt;BBC’s&lt;/i&gt; article, asserted that aid-in-dying laws “lead to ‘silent coercion’ whereby vulnerable people think their only option is to die.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article’s author, Medical Editor Fergus Walsh, continues:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a story about one man’s death in California - it’s about what could become a reality here in England and Wales for those who qualify for an assisted death and choose to die this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re for or against the proposed new Westminster law, the death of a loved one is a deeply personal and emotional time for a family. Each death leaves an imprint, as will Wayne’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;LINK: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rgd4yrz3eo"&gt;California man invites BBC to witness his death as MPs debate assisted dying&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="block"&gt;According to the health department, anyone exposed could develop symptoms by April 17. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="block"&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Measles symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose, watery red eyes, and a rash that usually appears between three and five days after symptoms begin. The rash usually begins as flat red spots that appear on the face at the hairline and spread downward to the neck, torso, arms, legs, and feet. Measles can also cause serious complications, such as pneumonia and encephalitis (swelling of the brain), and can lead to miscarriage in pregnant people, premature birth, or a low-birth-weight baby.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News 12 - New Jersey</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 17:00:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixgFBVV95cUxQTm9EQ0hHTll0Ny1iTmJwME04OVFvT0ZwcHFZN1UtOWluWnV5SnFySGZPNHlHaWpIcmR4UVUwLWxHaldtcElkeDNNS0hzamxneXlraHJOVHhCSXNydWhSRnV4RmM1S1ljWHlrM05uM3psQzFxQ2JDelg3V3RnOE1FalZRenl0d3dLVktIRnZFVDhHSndicllKZ0RGanljQkVWX2xNYzNMU0QtZkc4dEROdmN6bXUyeENmY1VSZjVKbnFMOHRSNlE</guid></item><item><title>Seven signs you’re deficient in B12 and how to fix it - The Telegraph</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxQdGtsTzVmSWVBbHFuT1NPWW5RdG8zRmgxRUpFa2dhT0tod2JXakNGeXdhRzg1eGxfc3l0UHZqcl9SbFlhRE1WM0pBVUN0aXllYTgycm84UmpuLUVPeUFRXzlOaVp3UUZtMmhfQzlhRHNkemVyak9iOWNxNUpLTE9hVEN5azVHbTJfRm9KVFpYWnlHcjhKY0E1MVNGRm4xU09lbXNKcWUzcWdTVVdf?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;p&gt;Fatigue and muscle weakness. Memory loss and confusion. Pins and needles. The &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/vitamin-b12-deficiency/"&gt;signs of B12 deficiency&lt;/a&gt; are vague, wide-ranging and usually develop gradually. It’s something that tends to impacts us as we age – but young people can suffer with it too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And new evidence suggests that, as we age, even those who are not “deficient” could be unknowingly experiencing symptoms and would benefit from a higher intake. A &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27200" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;recent American study&lt;/a&gt; of 231 healthy volunteers, whose median age was 71, found that &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/01/01/vitamin-deficiencies-surge-hospital-admission-poverty-nhs/"&gt;those with lower B12 levels&lt;/a&gt; (but still in the normal range) showed signs of neurological and cognitive decline when performing a battery of timed tests in comparison with participants with higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what is B12 doing for us and how do we keep our levels up?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The seven vitamin B12 deficiency symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“B12 is essential for a functioning nervous system, healthy red blood cell formation and DNA synthesis,” says Dr Sabine Donnai, GP and longevity doctor. “It plays a role in the conversion of protein and fat into energy, and the formation of neurotransmitters and hormones that control our brain function.” B12 is closely linked to folate (also known as B9). They play similar roles in the body and B12 is crucial for folate metabolism – a vital bodily process that allows cells to function properly – and vice versa. “It’s like your right and left arm, they need to be together,” says Donnai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deficiency has a very wide impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;1. Lack of energy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unexplained &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/supplements/vitamin-b12-brain-fog-deficiency-iron-rich-diet/"&gt;general tiredness and fatigue&lt;/a&gt;, maybe breathlessness too, can be a sign of Vitamin B12 deficiency,” says Donnai. “If B12 levels are low, the red blood cells will struggle to form, which means you won’t have enough oxygen delivered to any part of your body or your organs, whether it’s kidneys, brain, heart or lungs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;2. Strange sensations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These could include burning, numbness or pins and needles in hands, legs and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need B12 to make the ‘myelin sheath’, the protective layer that surrounds nerve cells,” says Dr Geoff Mullan, functional medicine practitioner at Human People. That layer allows for the efficient transmission of our nerve signals. “Without it, you stop conducting so well. If it goes on for long enough, the nerve damage can be permanent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;3. Unsteadiness on the legs...&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;...Or other difficulties with coordination. This damage to the nerves and spinal cord can also lead to impaired balance and unsteadiness, as well as difficulty with motor skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;4. Memory loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need B12 to make new neurotransmitters,” says Mullan. The nerve damage and brain atrophy caused by a B12 deficiency can mirror the symptoms of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;5. Brain fog&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Difficulty thinking and reasoning. People with a vitamin B12 deficiency will often describe being unable to focus or concentrate, and experience difficulties completing tasks. “You’ll struggle to ‘activate’, i.e. start tasks, and also ‘do’, i.e. continue tasks,” says Mullan, “as all your mental and physical systems are struggling.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;6. Depression, agitation, anxiety and mood swings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“B12 is important in the formation of serotonin, which helps regulate mood, sleep and appetite,” says Mullan. It’s also involved in the production of dopamine and norepinephrine, other neurotransmitters that play a key role in mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;7. Poor oral health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recurrent mouth ulcers, painful cracks at the corners of the mouth and a sore, inflamed tongue. “In serious cases, the tongue almost becomes smooth and glossy like the inside of your cheeks, where usually the tongue should be rough,” says Donnai. (This is called “glossitis” and is probably caused by lack of oxygen and nutrients reaching the tongue.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How to diagnose a B12 deficiency&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to test your B12 level through your GP or pharmacy – you can buy at-home tests too. “If you are going to use the at-home tests, make sure they have the CE mark,” says Donnai. One problem with at-home finger-prick tests is that, if not done properly, you can squeeze out serum, dilute the result and get an inaccurate reading. Any results should be taken to the doctor. Understanding whether you have a deficiency is more complicated than a single number, says Donnai. “We usually conduct tests that won’t be done in isolation. It will require measuring haemoglobin levels and red blood cells too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How to treat a B12 deficiency&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Injection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fastest way to correct a serious deficiency is through a course of B12 injections called hydroxocobalamin, typically given every other day over a two-week period. Injections are the only treatment for people whose deficiency is a result of a condition called pernicious anaemia which prevents the absorption of B12 in the intestine (see “What causes B12 deficiency?”, below). With injection, B12 is delivered directly to the bloodstream, bypassing the digestive system. In cases of pernicious anaemia, injections are required for life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Nasal spray&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an option for people who don’t like injections, again bypassing the digestive system and delivering B12 directly to the bloodstream through the nasal lining. “I am not a fan of sprays as dosing with them can be erratic although absorption is often high,” says Mullan. “The only patients I have seen with dangerously high vitamin D levels are people using sprays.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Tablet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For most people whose B12 deficiency is dietary-related, a high strength tablet works just as well as injections and they are a lot less expensive,” says Mullan. “The best ones are those that are absorbed in the mouth and come in its active form, methylcobalamin.” For adults with diet-related B12 deficiency, the usual dose is 50 to 150 micrograms taken once a day. For adults with a B12 deficiency not caused by diet, it’s one or two 1,000-microgram tablets taken once or twice a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What causes B12 deficiency?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/07/11/vitamin-b12-deficiency-warning-nice-elderly-brain-fog-vegan/"&gt;A vegan diet&lt;/a&gt; is probably the biggest cause,” says Donnai. “A B12 deficiency is one of the biggest problems a vegan can face.” B12 is found mainly in animal products – meat, fish and dairy. (Dairy is important, even if you eat fish and meat, as it makes B12 more “bio-available”.) However, high-meat, low-veg diets can also be a problem. “People on Atkins-type diets restrict the intake of foods that are rich in folate, like fruits, vegetables and wholegrains, and if you are lacking folate, your B12 can’t work properly,” explains Donnai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Low stomach acid&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are on proton pump inhibitors to reduce acid in their stomach – which is 10 per cent of the population – are at risk of B12 deficiency. “It’s a massive cause,” says Mullan. “When you eat a piece of protein, B12 is bound on and you need stomach acid to release it. If you don’t have the acid, it doesn’t happen.” (This is why B12 supplements that are absorbed in the mouth work better when the stomach isn’t doing its job.) Metformin, the medication taken for Type 2 diabetes, can also lead to B12 deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Coeliac disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;B12 deficiency is common in cases of &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/hidden-signs-coeliac-disease/"&gt;coeliac disease&lt;/a&gt;, especially when untreated. The damage caused by coeliac disease to the small intestine can prevent the absorption of nutrients. Other conditions that can cause B12 deficiency include &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/01/24/talking-therapy-treatment-bowel-disorders-crohns-disease/"&gt;Crohn’s disease&lt;/a&gt; and chronic pancreatitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin B12 deficiency becomes more common as we age, affecting around one in 10 people aged 75 or over and one in 20 people aged over 65. This is partly because digestion slows down and stomach acid decreases so the capacity to absorb B12 declines too. “Ageing itself requires more energy and more repairing needs to be done and so the need for B12 is higher,” says Donnai. “At the same time, as we age, we tend to eat a less varied diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol affects B12 levels in many ways. It decreases stomach acid which we need to release B12 from food, and also irritates the lining of the stomach and intestines, leading to gastritis which also reduces absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Pernicious anaemia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pernicious anaemia is an autoimmune disease which prevents the absorption of B12. When B12 is released from food, it binds on to a transporter called intrinsic factor, which then transports the B12 through the small intestine where it will be absorbed. When someone has pernicious anaemia, the body attacks the cells which produce this intrinsic factor. Without this key transporter, the B12 can’t be transported and utilised. Although the condition can occur at any age, peak occurrence is at 60 years of age and it’s more prevalent in women. Anyone with a confirmed B12 deficiency should also be tested for intrinsic factor antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What foods are highest in B12?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You need to be eating as varied a diet as possible in order to keep your B12 and folate levels up together,” says Nicola Shubrook, a nutritionist with Urban Wellness. “For B12, it’s animal products – meat, fish and dairy. If you’re a vegan, there is fortified nutritional yeast. Folate-rich foods are leafy green vegetables, broccoli, peas, citrus fruits, chickpeas and kidney beans.” Marmite is another vegetarian source of B12, although with a very high salt content. One 8g serving provides 76 per cent of the recommended B12 daily intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The NHS guidelines recommend 1.5mcg of B12 for adults each day,” says Shubrook.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/29/rfk-jr-body-shames-west-virginia-governor" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;visited West Virginia&lt;/a&gt; on March 28 to promote his “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) agenda at an event where he cruelly criticized state Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s weight. Kennedy suggested that he would host a public weigh-in and celebration once Morrisey had shed 30 pounds, and Kennedy had an idea about how the governor could do it: “We’re going to put him on a carnivore diet,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Weeks before, science journalist and meat enthusiast Nina Teicholz argued in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece titled “&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/meat-will-make-america-healthy-again-federal-guidelines-nutrition-reform-protein-eded2b3e"&gt;Meat Will Make America Healthy Again&lt;/a&gt;” that when the US government updates its dietary guidelines this year, it needs to keep meat firmly at the center of the plate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have questions or comments on this newsletter?&lt;/strong&gt; Email us at futureperfect@vox.com!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“The Trump administration can ensure that federal dietary guidelines recognize the role of high-quality protein in improving Americans’ health,” Teicholz wrote. (In her view, “high-quality protein” comes from animals, while protein from plants is “inferior.”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Meat industry groups, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/HHS-OASH-2024-0017-9142"&gt;National Cattlemen’s Beef Association&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/HHS-OASH-2024-0017-8961"&gt;National Pork Board&lt;/a&gt;, have made similar pleas. Lucky for them, Kennedy and US Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins — who so far has &lt;a href="https://www.rfdtv.com/ag-sec-brooke-rollins-has-taken-hpai-vaccines-off-the-table"&gt;acted&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="/future-perfect/405972/trump-slaughter-line-speed-poultry-pork"&gt;lockstep&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href="https://nppc.org/news/nppc-congratulates-appreciates-usda-secretary-rollins-commitment-to-fixing-prop-12/"&gt;meat industry&lt;/a&gt; — are in charge of publishing the new federal dietary guidelines, which are updated every five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But the push to get Americans to eat more meat goes against what the government’s own nutrition experts recommend. In December, a government-commissioned expert committee &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/Scientific_Report_of_the_2025_Dietary_Guidelines_Advisory_Committee_508c.pdf"&gt;recommended the federal dietary guidelines be updated&lt;/a&gt; to encourage Americans to eat less red and processed meat and more protein from plant-based sources, like beans and lentils. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And it’s unclear what era of meat supremacy Teicholz means to invoke when she says meat will make America healthy again. Americans are eating more meat — and other animal products — than ever, and it doesn’t seem to be making us any healthier, though, as rates of diet-related diseases like cancer, heart disease, and Type 2 diabetes remain high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Teasing apart cause and effect in nutrition research is notoriously messy and complicated, and our high levels of meat consumption alone can’t explain America’s high rates of chronic disease — other factors, like consumption of highly processed sugary and salty foods, along with rates of exercise, alcohol and tobacco intake, health care access, and exposure to pollution, also determine health outcomes. But study after study has found that high meat consumption can increase our risk of diet-related chronic diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While many Americans might like to hear that our abnormally high levels of meat consumption is actually healthy and virtuous — and that we need to eat even more of it — nutrition research largely shows that we would be better off if we did the very opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="make-america-eat-more-plants" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make America eat more plants &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-023-03093-1"&gt;significant body&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8604150/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that when people &lt;a href="https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-023-00877-2"&gt;eat more healthy plant-based foods&lt;/a&gt;, like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes, they can lower their risk of &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/11/3952"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-023-00877-2"&gt;certain types of cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2738784"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-023-00877-2"&gt;premature death&lt;/a&gt;.

It has also driven the EAT-Lancet Commission, a large, global committee of nutrition and sustainability experts, to &lt;a href="https://eatforum.org/lancet-commission/eatinghealthyandsustainable/"&gt;advocate for a diet&lt;/a&gt; that would reduce the average American’s consumption of meat by about 75 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For a time, going in that direction seemed like it might be possible. Americans ate less meat during the Great Recession, even if it was done primarily to save money rather than improve personal health. And through the 2010s, the term “flexitarian” rose to prominence as a &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2018/consumers-cite-health-concerns-cost-as-reasons-they-eat-less-meat"&gt;significant share&lt;/a&gt; of Americans &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/282779/nearly-one-four-cut-back-eating-meat.aspx"&gt;told pollsters&lt;/a&gt; they were cutting back on meat while the benefits of plant-based eating entered the zeitgeist thanks to celebrities like &lt;a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/review-i-tried-beyonce-22-days-nutrition-vegan-meal-plan-217895"&gt;Beyoncé&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/lizzo-good-as-hell-peta-vegan-video-1235119429/"&gt;Lizzo&lt;/a&gt;. By the early 2020s, the &lt;a href="/2019/5/28/18626859/meatless-meat-explained-vegan-impossible-burger"&gt;hype around new-and-improved plant-based meat and milk products&lt;/a&gt; from startup darlings Beyond Meat, Oatly, and Impossible Foods became inescapable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But this all proved to be more show than substance — American consumption of meat, dairy, and eggs has only increased over the last decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And the proverbial vibe has shifted from the days of buzzy Impossible burgers and skipping meat on Mondays. The health halo around “plant-based” products has worn thin — in part due to &lt;a href="/future-perfect/391795/ultra-processed-foods-science-vegan-meat-rfk-maha"&gt;flimsy science&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90931204/beyond-impossible-disinformation-mystery-berman"&gt;mass PR campaign&lt;/a&gt; funded by the meat industry — while meat consumption is once again culturally ascendant, as &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/03/meat-boom-trump-rfk-jr/682150/"&gt;The Atlantic’s Yasmin Tayag&lt;/a&gt; captured last week. The signs are everywhere, Tayag notes: declining plant-based meat sales, America’s protein fixation, the rise of the “manosphere,” and the belief of some of its loudest voices that masculinity requires eating lots of meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Messages of moderation in the annals of American nutrition research appear to be no match against the &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/02/is-an-all-meat-diet-what-nature-intended"&gt;popularity of carnivore diet devotees&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.grubstreet.com/article/high-protein-diet-food-grocery-stores.html"&gt;protein maxxing&lt;/a&gt;, and MAHA-aligned health influencers who rail against cooking with seed oils while praising butter and beef tallow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;After decades of government hesitance to confront the roots of America’s biggest diet-related health crises, Kennedy and the MAHA coalition’s promises to challenge large food companies and address chronic disease head-on is refreshing. But its prescription is more vibes and anecdotes than evidence. The MAHA coalition doesn’t appear to ever question our high levels of animal product consumption, for example, but rather wants to increase it, and in supposedly “natural” forms: &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/02/04/raw-milk-mom-influencers-rfk-jr-dangers-bird-flu/78019020007/"&gt;raw milk&lt;/a&gt; over nondairy milk, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/mar/29/rfk-jr-says-they-are-poisoning-us-influencers-call-them-unnatural-but-what-is-the-truth-about-seed-oils"&gt;butter and beef tallow&lt;/a&gt; over seed oils, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo7ZgOAQyJ0"&gt;grass-fed beef&lt;/a&gt; over feedlot beef.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In this way, many MAHA supporters fall prey to the same fallacy of many liberal food reformers: the belief that &lt;a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/193307/nature-solutionism-vaccines-beef-climate"&gt;only what is “natural” is good&lt;/a&gt;. But milk is now pasteurized because raw milk can make people terribly sick, plant-based seed oils are likely healthier than butter, and grass-fed beef is &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/03/17/grass-fed-beef-health-emissions/"&gt;worse for the planet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/is-grass-fed-beef-really-better-for-you-the-animal-and-the-planet/2015/02/23/92733524-b6d1-11e4-9423-f3d0a1ec335c_story.html"&gt;hardly better&lt;/a&gt; for you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While beans and lentils are less protein-dense than meat — and are less easily digested, as Teicholz rightly points out in her op-ed, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/10/31/animal-plant-protein-absorption-digestion/"&gt;if only slightly&lt;/a&gt; — they’re also free of cholesterol, extremely low in saturated fat, and loaded with fiber, which, unlike protein, more than &lt;a href="https://nutrition.org/most-americans-are-not-getting-enough-fiber-in-our-diets/"&gt;90 percent&lt;/a&gt; of Americans are deficient in.

But there is a cost to this collective dismissal of nutrition and public health research: &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.26.23300536v1"&gt;Some research&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1523119113"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt; that countries would save on health care costs if their citizens ate more plant-rich diets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If the Trump administration is sincere about cost cutting, and RFK Jr. is sincere about making America healthier, they both ought to take that advice to heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vox</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 16:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxPXzF1TW9yZXBLM0xGbzllbWgzREdZT3BqakNDblIwRU9IdTNXUE82WHRMY3RqQkU0Q3FUMFN0UmNjYlZrQ1pDZG11RmpNam05a2xOMWJ1cnA4aHhwRE44VHVEZy1hTmk2aU5abFVjaEpDY3A2dzMtVmxDQW1oRVpaQkJaa3Z2dEE</guid></item><item><title>Cardiologists have announced THIS vegetable as #1 for heart health - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi6AFBVV95cUxNOEZIS1lPUm5ZcHU1LVZoVEg5S3NYdThwaE5GOTBmQXg1RkRQSjR5aVdPT2pyRUYtMnJlNS11M3U3bE9ROE1RTE12Vm5oOHB1M2dFVXVjVmJVVk03MF81SGNxMzRpRDhGRUlVWXJwUk1FRG42cDdIVWQzWVU1V3BGNDZXRlRXMkhSVWhiX3V1LUU2UDdzVXVzZ1pkZ3Z0RmtIaW1ZSVp2b0JqWTBPRXl3eXpfVWNTNUZUTi1YbDlSclVNVVFoUS0wS2FJMWJyemdKdDMtaFhyV2dGLTVwajQ5cWtFakJLc2F6?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, no one would be surprised to find that vegetables are one of the most recommended objects of consumption for good heart health. According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, with an estimated 17.9 million deaths each year. Most of these deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and their leading reasons are unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and addiction to tobacco and alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most cardiologists prescribe a healthy diet filled with fruits and vegetables for a healthy heart. However, now the cardiologists have lifted the veil from the #1 vegetable that you should eat to have a healthy and happy heart. And that vegetable is (cue the drum sounds) Brussels sprouts!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cabbage-like veggies are so beneficial for your heart that Carl Lavie Jr, M.D., FACC, medical director of Cardiac Rehabilitation and Prevention at Ochsner Health, said that they’re one of his top choices for heart health, as “It’s one many do not consider!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brussels sprouts are rich in fibre&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibre is one important nutrient that many of us don’t get enough of, and brussels sprouts are filled with them. A cup of these vegetables contains 6 gms of fibre, which can help you get the recommended 25-38 gms of the nutrient you need each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11906-022-01216-2" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, fibre-rich diets can lead to alterations in the gut bacteria that help in decreasing the blood pressure. The gut microbes consume the fibre to produce beneficial compounds called short-chain fatty acids, which improve heart health by reducing blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brussels Sprouts are rich in Vitamin K&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin that helps the blood clot and maintains bone strength. It is mostly found in the green leafy veggies, but brussels sprouts are the best vegetable choice if you want to increase your vitamin K intake. One cup of cooked brussels sprouts provides two-and-a-half times the vitamin K you need in a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mgid_country_osv_parent"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that vitamin K can interact with some medications, such as blood thinners, so in case you are taking medication for the same, consult your doctor before increasing your intake of veggies rich in this vitamin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brussels Sprouts are rich in Nitrates&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

They are a debatable topic in the nutrition field; however, as per &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-024-03577-8" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, natural nitrates found in vegetables such as brussels sprouts can be healthy for the heart. When nitrates enter the body, it converts them into nitric oxide, which helps expand the blood vessels. Thus, blood inside the body is able to flow freely, improving circulation and decreasing pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brussels sprouts are rich in Vitamin C&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cup of cooked brussels sprouts can provide the consumer a day’s worth of vitamin C. This vitamin fights the free radicals in the body that target the heart and lead to conditions such as atherosclerosis, wherein a plaque composed of fat, cholesterol and other substances forms in the artery walls, leading to their narrowing and then potentially blocking the blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brussels sprouts are rich in Potassium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many of us overlook the consumption of potassium in our diet, this nutrient is also good for the heart. A cup of cooked brussels sprouts has roughly 10% of the daily value of potassium. Thus, consuming these veggies will help in regulating your blood pressure by countering the impact of sodium, which most of us consume a lot of. Additionally, as per the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salt/sodium-potassium-health/index.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, it also protects the body from heart diseases and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you may have been overlooking the purchase of brussels sprouts in your weekly grocery shopping and consuming them in your daily diet, their advantages must serve as an eye-opener for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 16:34:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi6AFBVV95cUxNOEZIS1lPUm5ZcHU1LVZoVEg5S3NYdThwaE5GOTBmQXg1RkRQSjR5aVdPT2pyRUYtMnJlNS11M3U3bE9ROE1RTE12Vm5oOHB1M2dFVXVjVmJVVk03MF81SGNxMzRpRDhGRUlVWXJwUk1FRG42cDdIVWQzWVU1V3BGNDZXRlRXMkhSVWhiX3V1LUU2UDdzVXVzZ1pkZ3Z0RmtIaW1ZSVp2b0JqWTBPRXl3eXpfVWNTNUZUTi1YbDlSclVNVVFoUS0wS2FJMWJyemdKdDMtaFhyV2dGLTVwajQ5cWtFakJLc2F6</guid></item><item><title>Do You Need a Measles Booster Shot?

              &lt;p&gt;Measles has been making an unwelcome comeback in the &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/eye-popping-who-report-shows-measles-surging-across-the-globe-2000576089"&gt;U.S. and world&lt;/a&gt; lately. Its resurgence might be enough to make many of us reasonably wonder: Just how protected am I from measles? And should I think about getting a booster vaccine shot?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s important to emphasize that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is highly effective—providing 97% protection from measles with the standard two-shot series. Most Americans have and are still getting vaccinated with the MMR vaccine, thanks to routine childhood programs that were established nationwide &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4388794/#:~:text=In%201969%2C%20only%2017%20states%20had%20school%20laws%20that%20included%20measles%3B%20by%201980%2C%20all%2050%20states%20had%20them."&gt;starting in the 1980s.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These programs require children to receive several vaccines to attend public school, but families can obtain medical or personal exemptions depending on the state. As of the 2023-2024 school year, roughly 93% of school-age children in the U.S. have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_7-mmr-vaccine-coverage-for-kindergarteners-by-school-year-2009%e2%80%932024:~:text=However%2C%20vaccination%20coverage%20among%20U.S.%20kindergartners%20has%20decreased%20from%2095.2%25%20during%20the%202019%E2%80%932020%20school%20year%20to%2092.7%25%20in%20the%202023%E2%80%932024%20school%20year%2C%20leaving%20approximately%20280%2C000%20kindergartners%20at%20risk%20during%20the%202023%E2%80%932024%20school%20year.%20To%20dive%20into%20vaccine%20coverage%20data%20for%20MMR%2C%20visit%20VaxView."&gt;received&lt;/a&gt; their MMR shots. That said, this percentage has slightly dipped in recent years and is now below the threshold of herd, or community, immunity needed to prevent the highly contagious virus from spreading widely in any given area. Hence the recent outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-measles-outbreaks-arent-going-away-soon-cdc-warns-2000575136"&gt;current measles outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; in Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/new-cases-push-us-measles-total-past-500"&gt;now officially over 500 cases&lt;/a&gt;, are occurring almost entirely among pockets of unvaccinated people, and it’s the unvaccinated who are much more vulnerable to measles, particularly very young children. But there are certain situations in which you might want or need a catch-up vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Walter Orenstein, a professor at the &lt;span class="il"&gt;Emory&lt;/span&gt; University School of Medicine and former director of the U.S. immunization program at CDC, notes that there were two types of measles vaccine that first became available in the U.S. in 1963.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One was a live, weakened virus vaccine—the same type used today, though later modified to be milder—and the other was an inactivated, or killed, measles virus vaccine. Unfortunately, the inactivated vaccine didn’t provide lasting immunity and increased the risk of a severe form of measles, known as &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/336928"&gt;atypical measles&lt;/a&gt;, in people who later caught the virus naturally. It was pulled by 1967—but some people who got it are still around today.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“So if someone was vaccinated between 1963 and 1967 with this vaccine, or an unknown vaccine, it’s reasonable to get another dose of the measles vaccine that’s actually effective,” Orenstein told Gizmodo. People who received this vaccine or are unsure of which vaccine they received during this time period are recommended to get at least one dose of the standard measles vaccine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Practically everyone born before 1957 is likely to have contracted measles, which also provides long-lasting immunity, so they’re generally fine. The Centers for Disease Control has said that healthcare personnel born before 1957 with no evidence of measles infection (either in their records or from lab tests) &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html#:~:text=Healthcare%20personnel%20born%20before%201957%20without%20laboratory%20evidence%20of%20immunity%20or%20disease%20should%20consider%20getting%202%20doses%20of%20MMR%20vaccine."&gt;should consider&lt;/a&gt; the standard two-dose series.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that Americans born between 1968 and 1989 received only one shot of the MMR vaccine. Even a single shot is highly effective—about 93%—so most people in this scenario are well protected. But the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/questions.html#:~:text=If%20you%20were,a%20measles%20outbreak"&gt;does recommend&lt;/a&gt; that adults at higher risk for measles exposure get their second shot if they haven’t already. These higher-risk groups include college students, healthcare personnel, people traveling internationally, and anyone else who’s deemed to be at risk by public health officials, such as people living near active outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The nearly 100% protection provided by full MMR vaccination does still leave open some tiny room for vulnerability, of course. Sometimes, a fully vaccinated person, exposed to measles during an outbreak, will get sick. This might happen because the person’s immune system didn’t mount a full protective response at the time of vaccination, or because a person’s immunity has waned over time.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, waning immunity isn’t a major individual concern. Studies have estimated that somewhere between &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X23009507"&gt;0.22%&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(24)00181-6/fulltext"&gt;0.04%&lt;/a&gt; of the vaccine’s effectiveness declines yearly. This means it would take between five and 25 years for the average person to be 1% less protected than they were right after their MMR shots.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are concerned about your susceptibility to measles, or you don’t know your vaccination status, you can always talk to your primary care doctor. Your doctor might run a blood test to check for measles antibodies—or even proactively recommend an MMR dose. While no one likes a needle, the MMR vaccine is perfectly safe, so getting an extra shot is fine even if you might already be well-protected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“One of the pluses, if someone happens to be already immune, is that nothing would happen because their bodies would kill the vaccine virus before anything can happen,” Orenstein said.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Outside of a few corner situations, though, measles remains a more serious threat to the unvaccinated, including people who are too young or medically unable to get vaccinated, such as people with severely weakened immune systems. The best way to keep the virus contained, he notes, is to make sure everyone who can get vaccinated does.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That’s why it’s so critical that we get very high immunization levels in our communities. Because for the measles virus to survive, it needs to be transmitted from an infectious person to a susceptible person. And if the infectious person only comes in contact with immune people, that chain of transmission is broken and indirectly protects people who can’t be vaccinated because they have legitimate medical contradictions—they’re all protected if they’re not exposed,” Orenstein said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Children are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; to get their first MMR shot between 12 and 15 months of age, and their second shot between 4 and 6 years of age, though children at risk of exposure &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/measles-vaccine-can-young-children-get-early-dose-mmr-shot-rcna198038"&gt;during an outbreak or international travel&lt;/a&gt; may receive them earlier and/or an extra dose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles is no joke—it’s highly contagious and can be dangerous especially for kids and people who can’t get vaccinated. If you’re at risk, or uncertain about your status, you may want to talk to your doctor sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So residents of Wales born on either side of the dividing date were matched according to their use of preventative health services, past diagnoses, and educational level. The incidence of dementia was then compared between people on either side of September 2, 1933. As a first step, the researchers confirmed that the vaccine was effective at reducing the incidence of shingles, with numbers similar to those in the vaccine's clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, being eligible for the vaccine was associated with a 1.3 percent reduction in the absolute risk of a dementia diagnosis. That translates to a 8.5 percent reduction of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"&gt;relative risk&lt;/a&gt;; when scaled to account for the fact that fewer than half of those eligible received the vaccine, that works out to be a 20 percent reduction in relative risk, which is pretty substantial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure that it was real, the researchers repeated the analysis using a difference-in-difference approach and came up with roughly the same numbers. That also eliminates the possibility that people who came in for health care (for shingles or some other condition) were more likely to incidentally receive a dementia diagnosis. They also compared the before-and-after populations in terms of a collection of common health outcomes and found that none of those showed any change in the two populations. And nothing else related to NHS policy was changed based on the September 2 date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, in &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.08.23295225v1"&gt;a draft manuscript&lt;/a&gt; the researchers posted on the Med arXiv, the researchers find a similar effect when using UK HNS data to search for a protective effect of the shingles vaccines when it comes to deaths diagnosed to result from dementia. So by all indications, the effect was real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s going on?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest three potential explanations. One of them is the obvious: Suppressing the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus reduces dementia onset. But it's also possible that the effect is indirect—that dementia is associated with immune activity, and the vaccine alters that in some way. Finally, there's the possibility that being treated for shingles could promote the onset of dementia or increase the frequency of diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;

If you have a &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-meal-kit-delivery-service/" target="_self"&gt;balanced diet&lt;/a&gt;, chances are you're already getting enough nutrients, but that can change as we age. Older people are at an increased risk for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2682456/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;low vitamin consumption&lt;/a&gt; -- partly because our bodies can no longer effectively absorb certain nutrients. So, if you're dealing with deficiencies, are on specific medications or have particular health conditions, your doctor may advise you to take certain supplements to make sure your body has all the nutrients it needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;These are the top six vitamins and minerals that doctors recommend you focus on for healthy aging. Just be sure to talk to your doctor first before adjusting your diet or trying new supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Magnesium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium is a mineral that provides several key functions in the body. It keeps your muscles strong, regulates blood sugar levels and contributes to heart health. &lt;a href="https://www.vitality101.com/about-dr-teitelbaum" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Dr. Jacob Teitelbaum&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified internist in integrative medicine, told us that "magnesium is critical for well over 300 reactions in the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said an unprocessed diet has about 600 mg of magnesium daily, but the average American diet has less than 250 mg of magnesium after processing. For reference, the daily recommended amount of magnesium is &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/are-you-getting-enough-magnesium" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;400 to 420 mg per day for adult men&lt;/a&gt; and 310 to 320 mg for women, but more is needed for those who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teitelbaum warned that the effects of low magnesium may include an &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circulationaha.105.588327" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increased risk of metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. This can lead to heart attacks, strokes and dementia. You may also feel exhausted or experience widespread muscle pain if you're not getting enough magnesium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find magnesium in a wide range of ingredients. &lt;a href="https://fatlotofgood.com.au/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Dr. Peter Brukner&lt;/a&gt;, a specialist sports and exercise physician, said you can find magnesium in nuts, seeds, whole grains and leafy green vegetables like spinach. In extra yummy news, you can also get magnesium from dark chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some older adults or those who take specific medicines (such as diuretics or drugs for acid reflux) may not receive enough magnesium from their diet and might need &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/5-best-magnesium-supplements/" target="_self"&gt;a supplement&lt;/a&gt;," he said. "However, too much magnesium can cause stomach issues, so be careful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. B vitamins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Laurie Ambrose/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You also need a range of B Vitamins, including B12 and folate (also called folic acid), to maintain your health as you age. Vitamin B-12 works with folate to help your body make new cells, including blood cells and nerve cells. While you don't usually require more B12 as you age, your &lt;a href="https://aging.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nutrition-Needs_Vitamin-B12_FINAL-2.18.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;body cannot absorb it as well&lt;/a&gt; when you get older. Brukner said this is because "stomachs make less acid, and this acid is necessary to take the vitamin from food into the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teitelbaum said B vitamins are critical for energy production, and suboptimal levels can affect your health. He warns that B vitamin deficiency has been associated with "a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8079632/#s5" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;marked increase of dementia&lt;/a&gt; (especially folic acid) and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749379715000732" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increased risk of heart attack and stroke&lt;/a&gt; (especially in those with elevated homocysteine levels)." Symptoms of B12 deficiency include weakness or poor balance, loss of appetite and numbness and tingling in the hands and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B12 is found in animal proteins like meat, fish and eggs. Brukner said that if you don't eat these foods, you may want to turn to foods like cereals and nutritional yeast with added B12. "Older people, especially those having certain stomach issues or taking medicine that lowers stomach acid, might need to take a B12 vitamin supplement," he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amelia-ti/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Amelia Ti&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and diabetes educator in New York, who is also part of &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/how-we-ensure-accurate-and-reliable-medical-information/" target="_self"&gt;CNET's Medical Review Board&lt;/a&gt;, adds that people taking medicine that blocks B12 absorption, like omeprazole or metformin, may also need a vitamin B12 supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Calcium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Institute on Aging says that calcium is especially important for &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/vitamins-and-supplements/vitamins-and-minerals-older-adults#calcium" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;older people at risk for bone loss&lt;/a&gt;. The Institute recommends 1,000 mg each day for men between the ages of 51 and 70, and 1,200 mg per day for men 71 and older. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-vitamins-for-women-50-plus/" target="_self"&gt;Women aged 51 and up&lt;/a&gt; are recommended to take 1,200 mg each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Calcium is well-known for making bones strong, but it is also crucial for muscles to work right," Brukner said. "As people become older, their bodies take in less calcium from food, which can cause bones to become weaker." You can get calcium naturally from sources like milk, yogurt and cheese. The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health notes that &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/calcium/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;calcium is also available&lt;/a&gt; in kale, salmon, tofu, almonds and spinach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for supplements, Brukner said, "If you are at risk for bone troubles or don't get enough calcium in your food, taking supplements might be useful. But too much calcium can cause other issues like kidney stones, so talk with your doctor first."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Malorny/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is often called the sunshine vitamin because you typically absorb it through the skin just by being outside. However, during winter months, if you live in a cloudy climate or avoid natural sunlight as you age, you may not get enough. Your body &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/vitamin-d-supplements-explained-who-should-take-them/" target="_self"&gt;needs vitamin D to properly absorb calcium&lt;/a&gt;, making it an important nutrient for bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brukner says that in addition to sunshine, you can get vitamin D from fatty fish like salmon and mackerel, fortified milk and cereals. Your doctor may also recommend a supplement if you're experiencing bone loss or at risk of osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to bone health, Teitelbaum said vitamin D can help you fight off disease. He said, "Suboptimal vitamin D is associated with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6047889/#S8" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increased autoimmunity,&lt;/a&gt; higher risk of severe infectious diseases (&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/supplements-white-house-advisor-fauci-takes-every-day-to-help-keep-his-immune-system-healthy.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Dr. Fauci noted that he took vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; during the COVID pandemic) and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3440651/#:~:text=Vitamin%20D%20deficiency%20has%20been,it%20a%20potential%20risk%20factor." rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increased cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Omega-3s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids are essential to many of your body's functions. They play a role in both heart and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/multivitamins-memory-and-aging-everything-to-know/" target="_self"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;. However, as Cleveland Clinic points out, your body &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/17290-omega-3-fatty-acids" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;isn't able to produce enough omega-3s on its own&lt;/a&gt;. This means you need to get more from &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/reap-the-benefits-of-omega-3s-with-these-heart-healthy-foods/" target="_self"&gt;the foods you eat&lt;/a&gt; or supplements you take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Omega-3 fatty acids are very good for heart health and can help lessen swelling, which is important for older people," Brukner explained. "They are also beneficial for brain well-being and might help guard against memory loss and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4019002/#:~:text=More%20than%20a%20dozen%20epidemiological,as%20Alzheimer's%20disease%20(AD)." rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;diseases such as Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;." Ti adds that omega-3s help lessen swelling by reducing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty fish like salmon are a good source of omega-3 fatty acids. Brukner said you can also turn to flaxseeds, chia seeds and walnuts but added a warning: "These give a different type of omega-3 that the body does not use so easily." Fish oil and algae oil can also serve as supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Zinc&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/pba.v5.25592" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;2015 paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in Pathobiology of Aging and Age-related Diseases, calls zinc an "essential micronutrient for human health in general, and particularly for the elderly." The authors say zinc plays "an important role in the aging process" and that zinc deficiency may be connected to several age-related chronic illnesses, which include hardening of the arteries, degenerative diseases of the nervous system, age-related changes to the immune system and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we get older, our immune system becomes weaker, and if we don't have enough zinc, this can make it even worse," Brukner explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find zinc in shellfish, red meat, poultry, beans, nuts and seeds. Brukner said oysters are particularly zinc-rich. He added, "Some older people might find zinc supplements helpful, especially if they often get sick or do not eat enough foods high in zinc. But taking too much zinc can cause problems with other minerals in the body, so it's important to follow advised amounts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating well can help boost your bones, immune system and more as you age. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/pumping-iron-is-key-for-healthy-aging-heres-how-to-start/" target="_self"&gt;Along with exercise&lt;/a&gt; and other good habits, getting the right minerals and vitamins may improve your health. Try to get enough magnesium, B vitamins, calcium, vitamin D, omega-3s and zinc in your diet each day. Talk to your doctor before you take any supplements to find out how they may interact with your existing medications and health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 14:24:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxQQkhHYlJZNmo3Q2xqdVVvMXRtTEdyVG1mQTdaa1c1Mm5Td2RHRFcwOVU3OFh2WWJoLUhsYk15RzJFQnlYYlNxdlNFVmZLZllUNlIwQ1RRQTNFeHBoVGx0OWVWN1REcG01VThUNVotcFByTW1XMFhwakJqT0xnejE0NHpuSnV0TE1nS2JTZmxWaVpVSGJveFAtVG41emsycDFOc0tIYkRUYw</guid></item><item><title>‘World’s smallest pacemaker’ is implanted with a syringe and dissolves when it’s no longer needed - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxPRFdJT2VWX3RoTC11NWpOaWVkYnEyTTc5ZlJQMHpMbkhORGJTekVYUWFJUFpJMEdTQUNZZXo3ZTFoUjBpaV9rVjdmOFlvZm05bXJickRRS01oQ0w0UXQteGxWWDVvU0YtVTRKcktTaHdTTzRaamc5YjdjMnZvNHRQUXNmaWdBb3FlTGl0dmd3R0NKeER6R2c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;The world’s tiniest pacemaker — smaller than a grain of rice — could help save babies born with heart defects, say scientists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The miniature device can be inserted with a syringe and dissolves after it’s no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although it can work with hearts of all sizes, the engineers who created it at &lt;a href="https://news.feinberg.northwestern.edu/2025/04/02/worlds-smallest-pacemaker-is-activated-by-light/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/a&gt; say it is particularly well-suited to the tiny, fragile hearts of new-born babies with congenital heart defects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Scientists at Northwestern have invented the “world’s smallest pacemaker,” tinier than a grain of rice. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;JohnARogers/NorthwesternUni/SWNS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It measures just 1.8 millimeters in width, 3.5 millimeters in length and one millimeter in thickness, but it still delivers as much stimulation as a full-sized pacemaker.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tiny pacemaker is paired with a small, soft, flexible, wireless, wearable device that mounts onto a patient’s chest to control pacing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the wearable device detects an irregular heartbeat, it automatically shines a light pulse to activate the pacemaker.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The short pulses — which penetrate through the patient’s skin, breastbone and muscles — control the pacing.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Designed for patients who only need temporary pacing, the pacemaker simply dissolves after it’s no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team of engineers from Northwestern explained that the pacemaker’s components are biocompatible, so they naturally dissolve into the body’s biofluids, bypassing the need for surgical extraction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08726-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; shows the device’s efficiency across several large and small animal models as well as human hearts from deceased organ donors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have developed what is, to our knowledge, the world’s smallest pacemaker,” Northwestern bioelectronics pioneer Professor John Rogers, who led the development project, said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s a crucial need for temporary pacemakers in the context of pediatric heart surgeries, and that’s a use case where size miniaturization is incredibly important. In terms of the device load on the body — the smaller, the better.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;It’s activated by light and dissolves when it is no longer needed. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;JohnARogers/NorthwesternUni/SWNS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Northwestern experimental cardiologist Professor Igor Efimov, who co-led the study, said their “major motivation” was children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“About 1% of children are born with congenital heart defects, regardless of whether they live in a low-resource or high-resource country,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“The good news is that these children only need temporary pacing after a surgery. In about seven days or so, most patients’ hearts will self-repair. But those seven days are absolutely critical.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Now, we can place this tiny pacemaker on a child’s heart and stimulate it with a soft, gentle, wearable device.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“And no additional surgery is necessary to remove it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The project builds on a previous collaboration between Prof Rogers and Prof Efimov, in which they developed the first dissolvable device for temporary pacing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many patients require temporary pacemakers after heart surgery, either while waiting for a permanent pacemaker or to help restore normal heart rate during their recovery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Although it can work with hearts of all sizes, the engineers say it is particularly well-suited to the tiny, fragile hearts of new-born babies with congenital heart defects. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;John A. Rogers/Northwestern University&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the current standard of care, surgeons sew the electrodes onto the heart muscle during surgery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wires from the electrodes exit the front of a patient’s chest, where they connect to an external pacing box that delivers a current to control the heart’s rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;When the temporary pacemaker is no longer needed, surgeons remove the pacemaker electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But potential complications include infection, dislodgment, torn or damaged tissues, bleeding and blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Wires literally protrude from the body, attached to a pacemaker outside the body,” Efimov said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When the pacemaker is no longer needed, a physician pulls it out. The wires can become enveloped in scar tissue. So, when the wires are pulled out, that can potentially damage the heart muscle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s actually how Neil Armstrong died. He had a temporary pacemaker after a bypass surgery. When the wires were removed, he experienced internal bleeding.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rogers said that their original pacemaker worked well, but the size of its receiver antenna limited their ability to miniaturize it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;That it dissolves also eliminates the scar tissue usually created by removal. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;John A. Rogers/Northwestern University&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Instead of using the radio frequency scheme for wireless control, we developed a light-based scheme for turning the pacemaker on and delivering stimulation pulses to the surface of the heart,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is one feature that allowed us to dramatically reduce the size.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team also reimagined its power source.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Instead of using near-field communication to supply power, the new pacemaker operates through the action of a galvanic cell, a simple battery that transforms chemical energy into electrical energy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When the pacemaker is implanted into the body, the surrounding biofluids act as the conducting electrolyte that electrically joins those two metal pads to form the battery,” Rogers said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A very tiny light-activated switch on the opposite side from the battery allows us to turn the device from its ‘off’ state to an ‘on’ state upon delivery of light that passes through the patient’s body from the skin-mounted patch.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the patient’s heart rate drops below a certain rate, the wearable device detects the event and automatically activates a light-emitting diode.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“Because it’s so small, this pacemaker can be integrated with almost any kind of implantable device,” one of the scientists said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;JohnARogers/NorthwesternUni/SWNS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The light then flashes on and off at a rate that corresponds to the normal heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Infrared light penetrates very well through the body,” Efimov siad. “If you put a flashlight against your palm, you will see the light glow through the other side of your hand.”&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Rogers added explained that the heart requires a tiny amount of electrical stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“By minimizing the size, we dramatically simplify the implantation procedures, we reduce trauma and risk to the patient and, with the dissolvable nature of the device, we eliminate any need for secondary surgical extraction procedures,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We could incorporate our pacemakers into other medical devices like heart valve replacements, which can cause heart block,” Efimov added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Northwestern team say the technology’s versatility opens other possibilities for use in bioelectronic medicines, including helping nerves and bones heal, treating wounds and blocking pain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Because it’s so small, this pacemaker can be integrated with almost any kind of implantable device,” Rogers said.&lt;/p&gt;

Dr. Harrison was not involved in the new study, but has done &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03201-5" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;other research&lt;/a&gt; indicating that shingles vaccines lower dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Whether the protection can last beyond seven years can only be determined with further research. But with few currently effective treatments or preventions, Dr. Harrison said, shingles vaccines appear to have “some of the strongest potential protective effects against dementia that we know of that are potentially usable in practice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Shingles cases stem from the virus that causes childhood chickenpox, varicella-zoster, which typically remains dormant in nerve cells for decades. As people age and their immune systems weaken, the virus can reactivate and cause shingles, with symptoms like burning, tingling, painful blisters and numbness. The nerve pain can become chronic and disabling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

before, odds are you've tried just about everything. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end of the day, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14140345/guide-weight-loss-jabs-experts-latest-science-health-revolution.html"&gt;most weight loss experts&lt;/a&gt; agree that as long as you're in a 'calorie deficit' - eating less calories than is required for your body to maintain its current weight - you should see results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while this seems simple in theory, it's not always as simple in execution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, researchers are finding that intermittent fasting - one of the many weight loss 'hacks' you've probably tried - might be more efficient than simply cutting calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Intermittent fasting usually means cycling between periods of eating and not eating (fasting),' director of clinical education at Seca and registered dietician/nutritionist &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://thepcc.org/profiles/nina-crowley/"&gt;Nina Crowley&lt;/a&gt; told DailyMail.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained that the most common formats for intermittent fasting include 16:8 (where you fast for 16 hours and eat during an eight-hour window) or 5:2.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These patterns are designed to help people reduce overall energy intake without tracking every calorie,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-01631"&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, used a version called 4:3 intermittent fasting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dietician and nutritionist Nina Crowley said intermittent fasting may work for some because it feels less overwhelming than daily calorie restriction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Crowley explained that in this case, participants followed a 80 percent calories restriction on three (non-consecutive) days a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And on the other four days, they ate without calorie targets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The control group had a daily calorie restriction - and both groups were match for overall weekly calorie deficit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But their approaches were different, proving intermittent fasting to be more effective.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This approach may feel less overwhelming for some people compared to daily calorie restriction, as it allows for more flexibility and less constant focus on food,' Crowley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The intermittent fasting group lost 7.6 percent of their body fat over 52 weeks while the calorie deficit group lost five percent.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Crowley suggested one explanation could be that the intermittent fasting group didn't have to restrict their eating every day - reducing decision fatigue and improving adherence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The [intermittent fasting] group also had lower dropout rates (19 percent vs. 27 percent), suggesting it may have been more sustainable for some,' Crowley said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While typical intermittent fasting follows a 16:8 method, this study used a 4:3 structure (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'From a behavior change lens, people may find intermittent fasting easier to integrate because it defines boundaries (fast vs. eat) rather than asking for constant moderation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And from a metabolic standpoint, alternating fasting and feeding days may influence hormonal responses related to hunger and fat oxidation.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Crowley said that weight-loss methods should be evaluated in a more complex way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained that in this particular study, fat mass and fat-free mass were not directly assessed, which can vary whether or not people would want to use a specific method like intermittent fasting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We know from other research that prolonged or aggressive energy restriction - even in structured plans - may result in unwanted loss from muscle, especially without adequate protein intake or resistance training,' Crowley said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said a way to combat this in future studies is to couple any dietary strategy with body composition monitoring.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When we assess fat mass, muscle mass, and hydration status, we get a much more complete picture of someone's health progress,' Crowley said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sustainable weight loss should protect muscle and support energy and function - not just reduce the number on the scale.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Crowley said this study didn't take body composition or muscle mass into account (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While she agreed that intermittent fasting can be helpful for some people, she also pointed out that it's important to consider how realistically it may fit into daily life,  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Meals often serve social and emotional purposes beyond nutrition, and fasting windows may not always align with family routines, social events, or workout schedules,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Crowley also explained that those who are physically active may also rely on the timing of their meals for performance and recovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But this is why it's important for each individual to find something that works for them and their own, unique long-term health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When a plan feels flexible, realistic, and aligned with someone's lifestyle, it's more likely to lead to sustainable progress - not just in weight, but in overall health and quality of life,' Crowley said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;mol-permabox id="mol-66556140-0fc9-11f0-82c0-c75d4ffa30e6"&gt;&lt;div class=" mol-factbox art-ins femail" data-version="2" id="mol-306aa300-4f00-11e9-8cac-6f0dfc36d1de" data-permabox-url="/health/fb-6847595/WHAT-INTERMITTENT-FASTING-16-8-DIET.html"&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Intermittent fasting involves switching between days of fasting and days of eating normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Intermittent fasting diets fall generally into two categories - time-restricted feeding, which narrows eating times to 6-8 hours per day, also known as the 16:8 diet, and 5:2 intermittent fasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 16:8 diet is a form of intermittent fasting, also known as Time Restricted Eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Followers of the eating plan fast for 16 hours a day, and eat whatever they want in the remaining eight hours - typically between 10am and 6pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This may be more tolerable than the well-known 5:2 diet - where followers restrict their calories to 500–to-600 a day for two days a week and then eat as normal for the remaining five days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to weight loss, 16:8 intermittent fasting is believed to improve blood sugar control, boost brain function and help us live longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many prefer to eat between noon and 8pm as this means they only need to fast overnight and skip breakfast, but can still eat lunch and dinner, along with a few snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When you do eat, it is best to opt for healthy options like fruits, vegetables and whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And drink water and unsweetened beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drawbacks of the fasting plan may be that people overindulge in the hours they can eat, leading to weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also result in digestive problems over the long-term, as well as hunger, fatigue and weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/mol-permabox&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Between work, family, errands, and social commitments, daily exercise often takes a back seat. For many, squeezing in a gym session every day feels impossible. But what if you didn’t have to? New research shows that the weekend warrior routine may offer similar health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You don’t need to exercise every day to stay healthy. As long as you get 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week – whether packed into one to two days or spread out – you can significantly reduce your &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sitting-too-much-can-cause-premature-aging-even-if-you-exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;risk of dying&lt;/a&gt; from cardiovascular disease, cancer or other causes,” said study co-author Dr. Zhi-Hao Li, an epidemiologist at &lt;a href="https://portal.smu.edu.cn/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Southern Medical University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings come from analysis of a U.K. health database involving over 93,000 participants who were tracked using wrist accelerometers. The devices measured their movements precisely, thus avoiding the potential errors from self-reporting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-impacts-of-weekend-exercise"&gt;Impacts of weekend exercise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were divided into three groups: weekend &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/weekend-warrior-workouts-lower-the-risk-of-200-diseases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;warriors&lt;/a&gt;, regular actives, and inactive people. Both active groups showed clear health advantages over the inactive one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weekend warriors had a 32% lower risk of death from all causes, 31% lower from cardiovascular disease, and 21% lower from cancer. Regular actives showed similar, but slightly smaller reductions in risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This message is encouraging news for busy people who struggle to fit in daily workouts but can manage a concentrated burst of activity on weekends or over a couple of days,” noted Dr. Li. “The research provides reassuring evidence that even sporadic physical activity can have lasting &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/strength-training-may-be-the-best-exercise-for-insomnia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No major differences were apparent between the two active groups in terms of health outcomes. This suggests that total time spent moving matters more than how it’s spread out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-even-short-bursts-of-activity-help"&gt;Even short bursts of activity help&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To improve health, the World Health Organization (&lt;a href="https://www.who.int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;WHO&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; recommend that adults get between 150 and 300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week, or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fitness-focused-medicine-physical-activity-reduces-chronic-disease-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;activity&lt;/a&gt; in the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A combination of both also works. Activities can range from brisk walking, cycling, or jogging to household tasks like gardening and dancing, as long as the effort is moderate to vigorous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study gathered data using movement trackers worn on the wrist. The data came from the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;U.K. Biobank&lt;/a&gt; and included people aged 37 to 73, with slightly more women than men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the individuals included in the analysis, about 42% were weekend warriors, 24% were regular actives, and 34% were inactive and did not follow any exercise routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over eight years of follow-up, nearly 4,000 people died – with heart disease and cancer accounting for the majority of these deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-practical-advice-for-weekend-exercise"&gt;Practical advice for weekend exercise &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Heart Association expert Dr. Keith Diaz, who was not involved in the study, is a professor of behavioral medicine at &lt;a href="https://www.columbia.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people struggle to fit in daily &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/small-doses-of-exercise-can-greatly-reduce-dementia-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; during the workweek; however, this research shows that even if you can only be active on the weekends, you can still gain meaningful health benefits,” said Dr. Diaz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One important caveat to remember is that trying to fit 150 minutes of exercise into just one or two days can be a lot on your body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People aiming to become weekend warriors should build up gradually. Warm-ups and proper progression can lower the chance of injury. While some risk of musculoskeletal injuries exists, the health benefits are still much greater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations-of-the-research"&gt;Limitations of the research &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study offers valuable insights on exercise benefits for weekend warriors, the researchers acknowledged some limitations. The analysis was focused on physical activity during a single week and didn’t monitor long-term changes in behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most participants were white and lived in the U.K., so the findings may not reflect global patterns. Furthermore, the effects of physical activity are influenced by genetics, environment, and culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that more studies are needed with broader ranging samples. These studies may include varied backgrounds, longer timelines, and other health markers to better understand how weekend &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/this-exercise-routine-can-cut-your-risk-of-early-death-in-half/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;workouts&lt;/a&gt; affect diverse populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-focused-efforts-for-a-healthier-life"&gt;Focused efforts for a healthier life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study brings a hopeful message. You don’t have to overhaul your entire week to protect your health. A focused, vigorous effort on one or two days can still help you live longer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you prefer Saturday hikes or Sunday spin classes, you can count them toward your well-being – as long as they are intense enough and total a minimum of 150 minutes weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those with busy schedules, this research affirms that any movement that fits your lifestyle counts. Being a weekend warrior isn’t a fallback – it’s a legitimate strategy for a healthier, longer life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.124.039225"&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 12:39:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxQUFY4TWhxWDRYUEo5OFVwRVk0R1BmVm1VVlFyaDRhOHdhWkptVjhzb1dmd3JzNFMyMFF4MDJ6OW1lbUJfZzdSY0ktclJoQnh4bEMtWmlZZ0FpVzhGTllybGw3T0poTHVBdHB1ZzJQQkVPckZuRmF0RlJndkNWT3VDR1ktX1BNYWVnQkl3d01XYVd3Q0p6Y2I5S19n</guid></item><item><title>To Stop Malaria, Researchers Are Poisoning Mosquitoes With… Human Blood - Indian Defence Review</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxQdlBUbFMzNFJBa21hNWFlT2VhYUV6WGRyWld4U1poLW1Vbk1HejJud0JCZ3dFTVpoeWJoNVJTX3Z3Z1BsTk9WTzlBQ0c5Zm50WllJYTlJbXV2c09OanVQZDhoTGV6MUhUeDhRRTJsNHdVeENwM0hZTF80aVcyZ0IzU0dyWTBGcWVKSzRSUExkTUxCQnZTVzZLektyalJUWi1adFduWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malaria continues to kill over &lt;strong&gt;600,000 people&lt;/strong&gt; each year, despite decades of global intervention. But a surprising new strategy could soon shift the balance: a &lt;strong&gt;repurposed drug&lt;/strong&gt; that makes &lt;strong&gt;human blood&lt;/strong&gt; lethal to the very &lt;strong&gt;mosquitoes&lt;/strong&gt; that spread the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Scientists have discovered that &lt;strong&gt;nitisinone&lt;/strong&gt;, a medication developed decades ago, can kill mosquitoes within hours after they feed on blood containing even small doses of the drug. The approach doesn’t protect individuals directly from infection, but it could reduce &lt;strong&gt;mosquito populations&lt;/strong&gt; enough to slow or halt the spread of &lt;strong&gt;malaria&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Turning Blood Into a Mosquito Killer&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings, published in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adr4827" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science Translational Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, highlight how a low dose of &lt;strong&gt;nitisinone&lt;/strong&gt; can render blood lethal to mosquitoes. After feeding on treated blood, the insects died within hours. Remarkably, the drug remained active for up to &lt;strong&gt;16 days&lt;/strong&gt; in the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;This indirect method of control focuses on stopping the parasite’s transmission cycle by targeting mosquitoes before they can lay eggs. Scientists compare it to the principle behind &lt;strong&gt;herd immunity&lt;/strong&gt;, where protection arises not from individual immunity, but from coordinated, community-wide intervention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers caution that the drug is not intended as a stand-alone solution, but as part of an integrated approach that could include &lt;strong&gt;bed nets&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;insecticides&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;malaria vaccines&lt;/strong&gt;, and other control strategies. This method could be especially valuable in areas where mosquitoes have already developed &lt;strong&gt;insecticide resistance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;From Herbicide to Human Medicine to Mosquito Control&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The history of &lt;strong&gt;nitisinone&lt;/strong&gt; is unusual. It was originally developed as an &lt;strong&gt;herbicide&lt;/strong&gt; based on a natural toxin from the &lt;strong&gt;Australian bottlebrush plant&lt;/strong&gt;. Its mechanism involved disrupting &lt;strong&gt;tyrosine&lt;/strong&gt;, an amino acid crucial to plant metabolism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Later, researchers discovered that &lt;strong&gt;nitisinone&lt;/strong&gt; could help treat &lt;strong&gt;metabolic disorders&lt;/strong&gt; in humans, including &lt;strong&gt;tyrosinemia type I&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;alkaptonuria&lt;/strong&gt;—conditions where the body can’t properly break down tyrosine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Approved by the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Food and Drug Administration&lt;/strong&gt; in 1992, the drug became a lifesaving treatment for children with these rare diseases. “This is the only thing that has kept children with tyrosinemia type I alive,” said &lt;a href="https://biology.nd.edu/people/alvaro-acosta-serrano/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Álvaro Acosta Serrano&lt;/a&gt;, a coauthor of the new study and a &lt;strong&gt;parasitologist&lt;/strong&gt; at the &lt;strong&gt;University of Notre Dame&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While side effects exist in patients who need high doses of &lt;strong&gt;nitisinone&lt;/strong&gt;, researchers emphasize that the amount required to affect mosquitoes is significantly lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Biological Weakness Exploited&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discovery that nitisinone could target &lt;strong&gt;blood-feeding insects&lt;/strong&gt; goes back to 2016, when Brazilian researchers &lt;strong&gt;Marcos Sterkel&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Pedro Oliveira&lt;/strong&gt; found that mosquitoes, flies, and fleas rely on &lt;strong&gt;tyrosine metabolism&lt;/strong&gt; to process blood meals. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The insects are flooded with tyrosine after feeding, and if that processing system is disrupted, they die. The researchers approached Acosta Serrano’s lab, which had studied &lt;strong&gt;tsetse flies&lt;/strong&gt;, another blood-sucking parasite, to test the drug’s effect. The team later expanded the work to focus on mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;strong&gt;nitisinone&lt;/strong&gt; already has &lt;strong&gt;FDA approval&lt;/strong&gt;, it may face fewer regulatory barriers in its new application. It’s been approved for &lt;strong&gt;newborns&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;children&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;pregnant individuals&lt;/strong&gt; and has not been linked to adverse effects, making it an attractive candidate for broader use in &lt;strong&gt;public health&lt;/strong&gt; campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Promising but Complex Solution&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts in the field view the findings as exciting but recognize challenges. &lt;strong&gt;George Dimopoulos&lt;/strong&gt;, a molecular biologist at the &lt;strong&gt;Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health&lt;/strong&gt;, called the study “very interesting” and noted that side effects from &lt;strong&gt;nitisinone&lt;/strong&gt; appear less severe than those from &lt;strong&gt;ivermectin&lt;/strong&gt;, another drug previously studied for reducing &lt;strong&gt;malaria transmission&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One hurdle is &lt;strong&gt;cost&lt;/strong&gt;. Because nitisinone is currently used to treat rare conditions, it remains &lt;strong&gt;expensive&lt;/strong&gt;. Acosta Serrano believes that with more interest, production costs could be lowered by as much as &lt;strong&gt;80 percent&lt;/strong&gt;. But price isn’t the only concern. Since the drug doesn’t directly protect the individual taking it, there could be resistance to its widespread adoption. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s always tricky to convince people to take a drug that doesn’t protect them,” Dimopoulos said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers are exploring whether the drug could be delivered in different ways. Treating &lt;strong&gt;livestock&lt;/strong&gt;, which attract mosquitoes, could be one solution. Another involves &lt;strong&gt;insecticide-laced nectar bags&lt;/strong&gt; designed to draw mosquitoes while avoiding harm to other pollinators. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In theory, nitisinone could be administered via this method as well. Dimopoulos notes, “You would not necessarily have to administer it to humans.” As with any &lt;strong&gt;mosquito control&lt;/strong&gt; strategy, the possibility of &lt;strong&gt;resistance&lt;/strong&gt; developing remains. Still, both Acosta Serrano and Dimopoulos agree that &lt;strong&gt;nitisinone&lt;/strong&gt; could be a valuable addition to a diversified and &lt;strong&gt;population-specific&lt;/strong&gt; approach to malaria control. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“In some places, drugs combined with the vaccines could work better,” Dimopoulos explained. “In other places, &lt;strong&gt;insecticide spraying&lt;/strong&gt; and new technologies, like &lt;strong&gt;genetically engineered mosquitoes&lt;/strong&gt;, for example, could have greater efficacy.” He added, “There is no silver bullet for malaria. And I don’t think there will ever be a silver bullet.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Two years later, a neurologist confirmed that Krehbiel had Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EWTYO5WRTVGCRGTPLJCQPM3UOU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He was prescribed medications to help control motor symptoms since no cure exists for Parkinson’s disease. They, however, came with disabling &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00023210-200721080-00005" target="_blank"&gt;side effects&lt;/a&gt; such as nausea, low blood pressure, compulsive behavior and gastrointestinal issues. Patients may also experience hallucinations, excessive daytime sleepiness and involuntary, erratic movements called dyskinesias as complications from some Parkinson’s medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YDYDLZ3QBREYFC5J7XMOTZ2Y2M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I had terrible sleep.

Medical conditions such as epilepsy and schizophrenia are associated with abnormal brain rhythms, similar to cardiac arrhythmias. In Parkinson’s disease, neurons become overly synchronized in what is known as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B978012819410200014X" target="_blank"&gt;oscillopathy&lt;/a&gt;, which may interfere with the normal transfer of information and lead to symptoms such as tremors and stiffness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ARWUQAXMBBGLNKZ77RJCQK7DCA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Imagine you’re in a crowd, and there’s a hum of conversation, but you can easily hear yourself talk — that’s the normal broadband neural activity situation,” said &lt;a href="https://stanfordhealthcare.org/doctors/b/helen-brontestewart.html" target="_blank"&gt;Helen Bronte-Stewart&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of neurology and neurological sciences at Stanford School of Medicine. “But with oscillopathy, it’s as if you’re in a protest march where everybody’s chanting the same thing, and you can’t hear yourself speak.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-heMhiJ-isCenteredLayout-true" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="ZDQGCYID6JCNTMOCPXWIV2Z4MY" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="ZDQGCYID6JCNTMOCPXWIV2Z4MY"&gt;Adaptive DBS adjusts stimulation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FXSLCURLA5DJNFYYYN52OBSM4E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Both DBS and Parkinson’s medications have been shown to dampen oscillopathy in the brain. In particular, the steady electrical pulses from DBS help pace the neuronal firing in a way that overrides the hyper-synchronization of oscillopathy, returning the brain rhythms back to normal, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KGKOSIN4NZG4JGA4EYNAVCRWSA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;However, conventional DBS delivers electrical stimulation at a constant, “always on” setting, which can lead to periods of under-stimulation and overstimulation that result in slowness of movement or dyskinesias, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZHWHQ6PVTVGAZAHO7XGZ4YLJMM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Adaptive DBS, on the other hand, detects real-time neural signals and automatically adjusts stimulation in response to oscillopathy or other biomarkers.

These include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;hippocampus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;parahippocampal region&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;entorhinal region&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;inferior parietal region&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;precuneus region&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;cuneus region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside these Alzheimer’s-vulnerable brain regions, other factors are also associated with Alzheimer’s progression — namely, cerebral microbleeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, these are small bleeds within the brain and a sign of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7477392/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cerebral small vessel disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cerebral small vessel disease&lt;/a&gt;, which appears to be linked to Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sleep architecture, Alzheimer’s, and brain atrophy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest research explores the relationship between specific sleep phases and Alzheimer’s-vulnerable brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate, they recruited 270 participants who were involved in the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/science/atherosclerosis-risk-communities-aric-study" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Atherosclerosis Risk in the Communities Study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Atherosclerosis Risk in the Communities Study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They used polysomnography to assess sleep architecture. Then, they used MRI to look at the anatomical features of the brain (such as brain volume and evidence of cerebral microbleeds) 13–17 years later. They also measured the proportion of slow wave sleep, the proportion of REM sleep, and how often they experienced arousal during the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scientists found that having less slow-wave sleep was associated with a smaller inferior parietal region and cuneus. Similarly, having less REM sleep was linked to a smaller inferior parietal region and precuneus. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adjusting their analysis for errors, reductions in slow-wave and REM sleep were most tightly associated with atrophy of the inferior parietal region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, measures of arousal during sleep and microbleeds were not associated with the volume of any Alzheimer’s-vulnerable brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Reduced slow-wave and REM sleep may raise risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, this study is the “first to examine the relationship of sleep architecture with the atrophy of [Alzheimer’s]-vulnerable regions in older adults.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results of this study infer that reductions in slow-wave and REM sleep may play a significant role in the reduction of volume in the inferior parietal region.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier research has shown that &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325493#The-importance-of-sleep" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sleep helps clear toxins;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sleep helps clear toxins&lt;/a&gt; from the brain. The authors suggest that this might help explain why reductions in sleep might cause neurological atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; contacted &lt;a href="https://wesper.co/pages/about-wesper" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Chelsie Rohrscheib;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Chelsie Rohrscheib&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, a sleep expert, neuroscientist, and sleep consultant at Wesper, who was not involved in this study. We asked why changes in sleep architecture might influence brain atrophy and Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sleep has many crucial biological functions and is especially important for cell and tissue repair, brain maintenance, learning and memory, cognition, and brain waste clearance,” Rohrscheib explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Most of these functions occur during stage 3 slow wave sleep and REM sleep. All of these processes are crucial for maintaining brain health and reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s disease,” she detailed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rohrscheib told us how Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by a buildup of junk proteins in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These proteins are normally removed by a waste removal system that occurs during stage 4 slow wave sleep, called the &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325493" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:glymphatic system;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;glymphatic system&lt;/a&gt;,” she continued. “People who are chronically sleep-deprived and spend less time in slow wave sleep do not clear their brains effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also contacted &lt;a href="https://www.drleahkaylor.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Leah Kaylor;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Leah Kaylor&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, a licensed psychologist who specializes in sleep, who was also not involved in the current research. She delved into a little more detail about how this trash removal service works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While sleeping, the brain shrinks, creating more space for cerebrospinal fluid to flood the areas where the brain’s waste products accumulate. This fluid acts as a ‘car wash,’ clearing out the toxins, misfolded proteins, and debris that have built up throughout the day, ensuring that our brain functions at its peak when it is time to wake up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, “these waste products include beta-amyloid, tau proteins, and other substances linked to neurodegenerative disorders,” Kaylor explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Limitations and more questions to answer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We asked Kaylor about the importance of these results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By examining a cohort over 13 to 17 years, the research provides a longitudinal perspective on how sleep architecture impacts brain structure over time,” she explained. This is important as it “strengthens the evidence for causal relationships.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the results of this study certainly are intriguing, the authors call for more research — this is a small study. Also, they write that their participant group was not particularly diverse, so their results might not be generalizable to other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the future of this line of investigation, one thing is by now clear: Sleep is essential for good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to get better sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We asked Rohrscheib to provide tips for anyone who struggles to get enough sleep:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;keep a consistent sleep schedule which allows you to get 7-9 hours of sleep per night, including on weekends&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;have a pre-bedtime routine which involves winding down and putting away electronics at least 1 hour before bed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;keep your room cool, dark, quiet, and comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She also advises people to speak with a doctor if they experience chronic sleep troubles, as this may be a sign of a sleep disorder like insomnia or sleep apnea.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaylor also provided some tips:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cut out caffeine 10 hours before bed:&lt;/strong&gt; “People don’t realize how long caffeine stays in the body and continues to work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t eat or drink too close to bedtime: &lt;/strong&gt;“Finish your last meal of the day and no more alcohol 3 hours before bed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calm down: &lt;/strong&gt;“Two hours before bed, begin to shift gears mentally to wind down and leave the stress of the day behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expose yourself to sunlight during the day: &lt;/strong&gt;“This is one of the most effective ways to strengthen the circadian rhythm, which is the body’s internal clock that regulates our sleep-wake cycle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new study adds to our understanding of the relationship between sleep architecture, brain atrophy, and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we need much more research to understand the precise mechanisms at play, focusing on getting more sleep is always a healthy option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you struggle to get to sleep, try this &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists say a traditional African diet — packed with grains like millet, root vegetables, yams and leafy greens — could be even more effective at keeping the immune system in check&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, there is just as much to learn from traditional African diets, especially now, as lifestyles in many African regions are rapidly changing and lifestyle diseases are increasing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The African diet includes plenty of vegetables, fruits, beans, whole grains, and fermented foods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Our study highlights the benefits of these traditional food products for inflammation and metabolic processes in the body.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, researchers recruited 77 healthy male volunteers from Tanzania, aged 25, on average. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Twenty three men who often consumed a traditional African-style diet were asked to switch to a 'western-style' diet, including processed meat, eggs and potato fries, for a fortnight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, 22 — who typically ate western-style meals — stuck to an African-style plan for two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A further 22 western-style dieters were also asked to drink Mbege, a traditional fermented banana beverage, for a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Five men who maintained their western-style and African-style diets were also included as controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The African-style diet involved maize, okra, plantain, kidney beans and avocados. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Western-style meals comprised of processed meats such as sausages, as well as potato fries, eggs and crepes. By contrast, the African-style diet involved maize, okra, plantain, kidney beans and avocados&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over a follow-up of two weeks, researchers tracked participants' blood proteins related to inflammation and metabolism, and did so again four weeks later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found those who switched to a western diet had increased levels inflammatory proteins in their blood and their immune cells responded less effectively to pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Writing in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03602-0"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, the researchers said the Western-style diet showed 'systemic inflammation and metabolic dysregulation'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has long linked higher levels of inflammation with an increased risk of diseases including cardiovascular disease, type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-7f85ae80-1079-11f0-8c28-6561da372c92"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and even some cancers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those who switched to a traditional African diet or consumed the fermented drink, meanwhile, showed a 'significant reduction' in inflammatory markers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some of these effects persisted even four weeks later, indicating that short-term dietary changes can have long-lasting effects, the researchers said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Quirijn de Mast added: 'We show how harmful an unhealthy Western diet can be. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'It typically consists of processed and high-calorie foods, such as French fries and white bread, with excessive salt, refined sugars, and saturated fats. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Nova system, developed by scientists in Brazil more than a decade ago, splits food into four groups based on the amount of processing it has gone through. Unprocessed foods include fruit, vegetables, nuts, eggs and meat.

With few effective treatments and increased prevalence, taking steps to potentially reduce risk is vital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the four phases of sleep:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 1: &lt;/strong&gt;The first stage once you have dropped off. It is relatively light sleep. Muscles begin to relax. It lasts for just 1–5 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 2: &lt;/strong&gt;Slightly deeper, this phase lasts around 25 minutes. The body relaxes further. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 3: &lt;/strong&gt;This is the deepest stage of sleep. Heart rate, breathing, and brain waves become more regular. Stage 3 is also called slow-wave sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 4: &lt;/strong&gt;This stage is also called &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/247927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep&lt;/a&gt; due to the movement of the eyes in this phase. During REM sleep, breathing becomes faster and blood pressure and heart rate become less regular.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, until the latest study, the direct links between specific aspects of sleep architecture and Alzheimer’s — specifically the neuroanatomy associated with this disease, had not been studied in depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s is characterized by brain atrophy. In other words, it shrinks. According to the authors of the new study, some brain regions &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31074810/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;atrophy more than others&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;. These include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;hippocampus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;parahippocampal region&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;entorhinal region&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;inferior parietal region&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;precuneus region&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;cuneus region.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside these Alzheimer’s-vulnerable brain regions, other factors are also associated with Alzheimer’s progression — namely, cerebral microbleeds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, these are small bleeds within the brain and a sign of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7477392/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;cerebral small vessel disease&lt;/a&gt;, which appears to be linked to Alzheimer’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest research explores the relationship between specific sleep phases and Alzheimer’s-vulnerable brain regions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They used polysomnography to assess sleep architecture. Then, they used MRI to look at the anatomical features of the brain (such as brain volume and evidence of cerebral microbleeds) 13–17 years later. They also measured the proportion of slow wave sleep, the proportion of REM sleep, and how often they experienced arousal during the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The scientists found that having less slow-wave sleep was associated with a smaller inferior parietal region and cuneus. Similarly, having less REM sleep was linked to a smaller inferior parietal region and precuneus. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adjusting their analysis for errors, reductions in slow-wave and REM sleep were most tightly associated with atrophy of the inferior parietal region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, measures of arousal during sleep and microbleeds were not associated with the volume of any Alzheimer’s-vulnerable brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, this study is the “first to examine the relationship of sleep architecture with the atrophy of [Alzheimer’s]-vulnerable regions in older adults.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The results of this study infer that reductions in slow-wave and REM sleep may play a significant role in the reduction of volume in the inferior parietal region.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier research has shown that &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325493#The-importance-of-sleep" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;sleep helps clear toxins&lt;/a&gt; from the brain. The authors suggest that this might help explain why reductions in sleep might cause neurological atrophy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt; contacted &lt;a href="https://wesper.co/pages/about-wesper" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Chelsie Rohrscheib&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, a sleep expert, neuroscientist, and sleep consultant at Wesper, who was not involved in this study. We asked why changes in sleep architecture might influence brain atrophy and Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sleep has many crucial biological functions and is especially important for cell and tissue repair, brain maintenance, learning and memory, cognition, and brain waste clearance,” Rohrscheib explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Most of these functions occur during stage 3 slow wave sleep and REM sleep. All of these processes are crucial for maintaining brain health and reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s disease,” she detailed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rohrscheib told us how Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by a buildup of junk proteins in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These proteins are normally removed by a waste removal system that occurs during stage 4 slow wave sleep, called the &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325493" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;glymphatic system&lt;/a&gt;,” she continued. “People who are chronically sleep-deprived and spend less time in slow wave sleep do not clear their brains effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; also contacted &lt;a href="https://www.drleahkaylor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Leah Kaylor&lt;/a&gt;, PhD, a licensed psychologist who specializes in sleep, who was also not involved in the current research. She delved into a little more detail about how this trash removal service works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While sleeping, the brain shrinks, creating more space for cerebrospinal fluid to flood the areas where the brain’s waste products accumulate. This fluid acts as a ‘car wash,’ clearing out the toxins, misfolded proteins, and debris that have built up throughout the day, ensuring that our brain functions at its peak when it is time to wake up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, “these waste products include beta-amyloid, tau proteins, and other substances linked to neurodegenerative disorders,” Kaylor explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We asked Kaylor about the importance of these results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By examining a cohort over 13 to 17 years, the research provides a longitudinal perspective on how sleep architecture impacts brain structure over time,” she explained. This is important as it “strengthens the evidence for causal relationships.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the results of this study certainly are intriguing, the authors call for more research — this is a small study. Also, they write that their participant group was not particularly diverse, so their results might not be generalizable to other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the future of this line of investigation, one thing is by now clear: Sleep is essential for good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We asked Rohrscheib to provide tips for anyone who struggles to get enough sleep:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;keep a consistent sleep schedule which allows you to get 7-9 hours of sleep per night, including on weekends&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;have a pre-bedtime routine which involves winding down and putting away electronics at least 1 hour before bed&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;keep your room cool, dark, quiet, and comfortable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;She also advises people to speak with a doctor if they experience chronic sleep troubles, as this may be a sign of a sleep disorder like insomnia or sleep apnea.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaylor also provided some tips:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cut out caffeine 10 hours before bed:&lt;/strong&gt; “People don’t realize how long caffeine stays in the body and continues to work.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t eat or drink too close to bedtime: &lt;/strong&gt;“Finish your last meal of the day and no more alcohol 3 hours before bed.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calm down: &lt;/strong&gt;“Two hours before bed, begin to shift gears mentally to wind down and leave the stress of the day behind.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expose yourself to sunlight during the day: &lt;/strong&gt;“This is one of the most effective ways to strengthen the circadian rhythm, which is the body’s internal clock that regulates our sleep-wake cycle.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new study adds to our understanding of the relationship between sleep architecture, brain atrophy, and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although we need much more research to understand the precise mechanisms at play, focusing on getting more sleep is always a healthy option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 10:54:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOOTBzelBaQmJIS2hERDlfUHFQU1RwOFRkWHJPcks3YXlnZnFrVlBmUlY2S19CZmlEdUgyZi0tbXZOV2cyUnFCRUJyVDd6YjVEWkF5ejR3UjQ5RnktclNaNjJaamFNa2FzRVdCUGZzcjNSV09mcDE5amtzRGc2d0JmTlNXTUxLSmk4S3hUdlRvNUM3Y3lqUEpyWEhyeXp6bV9UOGtvMXhLSXI</guid></item><item><title>Today’s audio update: Measles alert at Newark Airport, tragic car crash in Monmouth, rescued seal at beach - NJ.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1gFBVV95cUxPVDJ3M3JVeVg3c0ZtQUdoQ2JSSFM1TWFxYjgtNm95R1JEcENpOUsyTU5zOUJMTzlRS2RxNFc5WlZNLVIwQk04YmluZEFOLXRfUUNtZ0cycUstaW44a0NGekJ1MXBJNEhXN0wyMUJKWUU3RjVGQ2lPdW16WGVOSVhSWmxTUWtOM2NHTkh0Z1NsTnVkYlp1b0Y2NmJEaGxiVVVhdVpVczJDSTBIemJqcGI4SFhVZmo3dnVXMHZQX3lqLXhoXzY2bTBrNS1GM19CWE91SHVCb3BB0gHqAUFVX3lxTE96M0NLQ0pYT3BvMVNLdzdWbDRRMlpxOUdQdUZhTHA0NVkxOVpIOGgzaUZ2bDljYzlpN0VDSHFWd25pMHFOYk9fOUNtNjFETUJFb0ZpRi1NVlFJZWVCR1VSVVJyLWloemVtX3IzTHZld0dEMjFRMmtybTJZam16MkZVd09yV2lBeXltU2xxVjZXRDdLSVRVWm5IQUJIVHRFM1ZnRjZuY2c3VElvQjZCYlhLQTJhQWQxTDdXMDJKOG12TDAzSDE4ZlptcjJsbHJwVE1fZ2I1Sm5WS1dNWFlZOE00RGFDWk1STUVhZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="U3NJHP4R4FELDI7AUZMLHN3EHY"&gt;Hey there, New Jersey!

An outbreak that began in west Texas in January has since infected nearly 500 people across 19 states, including &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/measles.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;eight people in California&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An insidious but lesser-known consequence of even a mild measles infection is that it kills the very cells that remember which pathogens the patient has previously fought and how those battles were won. As a result, recurring bugs that might have caused only minor symptoms make patients as sick as if they’d never encountered them before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles destroys lymphocytes that defend against other bugs to make way for ones that defend against measles, an immunity won at the cost of other protections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This “immune amnesia,” physicians say, leaves patients vulnerable to reccurrences of diseases their immune cells were previously able to resist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a child gets sick with measles, “for the next two or three years, you kind of have to be looking over your kid’s shoulder, wondering if some otherwise routine virus or bacteria that they should be very well protected against is potentially going to land them in the hospital,” said Dr. Michael Mina, an epidemiologist who was previously an assistant professor of immunology and infectious diseases at Harvard Medical School. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even if your measles virus infection seemed mild and you kind of blew through it, it doesn’t mean that it was mild on your immune system,” Mina added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take rotavirus, Ratner said, which causes severe diarrhea that can be life-threatening for children if untreated. A child who has rotavirus once will have antibodies that offer protection against future infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a measles infection, said Ratner, author of the recent book “&lt;i&gt;Booster Shots: The Urgent Lessons of Measles and the Uncertain Future of Children’s Health&lt;/i&gt;,“ “could wipe out that immunity and they could be just as vulnerable to rotavirus as if they had never seen it before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immune amnesia results from the measles virus’ plan of attack. Viral particles travel via airborne droplets of saliva, mucus and cells that make their way into a new body when their unsuspecting host breathes them in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, they sneak past the protective barrier lining the respiratory system and head to the lymph nodes in search of cells that express a particular protein called signaling lymphocytic activation molecule, or SLAM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus then rides around the bloodstream on these hijacked SLAM-expressing cells, further infecting and destroying other SLAM expressers it meets on the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the SLAM-expressing cells that measles wrecks are memory B and T cells, two crucial players in a functioning immune system. Memory B cells manufacture the right antibodies quickly when a familiar microbe appears. Memory T cells recognize and kill viruses that your cells have encountered in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A measles infection feeds on these memory cells. Vaccines, in contrast, stimulate the production of memory B and T cells without consuming others in the process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was not yet understood in the decades before the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine’s approval in 1963, when measles was a common childhood disease that killed some 400 children in the U.S. each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For 100 years or more, we’ve known that measles does cause an acute susceptibility to other infections,” Mina said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A measles infection temporarily suppresses the immune system, Mina said, and it was long assumed that opportunistic infections around the time of the illness were the result of that short-term suppression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Mina and colleagues &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaa3662" target="_blank"&gt;published a paper &lt;/a&gt;that looked at mortality data in the U.S., the United Kingdom and Denmark before and after measles vaccines were introduced. They found that whenever there were measles outbreaks, childhood deaths from all other infectious  diseases remained significantly higher for two to three years in outbreak locations, an increase that accounted for up to half of all childhood deaths from infectious disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once those countries rolled out the MMR vaccine, measles cases fell, as expected. But so did childhood deaths from other infectious diseases, by about half. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years later, Mina and his collaborators took blood samples from 77 unvaccinated children in a community in the Netherlands  before and then two to six months after the children contracted measles. They found that the virus wiped out &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay6485" target="_blank"&gt;11% to 73% &lt;/a&gt;of the children’s preexisting antibodies to a host of pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as children in preschool fall ill constantly with common diseases they’re encountering for the first time, unvaccinated children who contract measles are at higher risk in the ensuing years for common early childhood sicknesses such as respiratory infections, earaches and viruses that cause diarrhea, said Shelly Bolotin, a scientist at Public Health Ontario in Canada and director of the Center for Vaccine Preventable Diseases at the University of Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In order to correct that depletion [of B and T cells], you need to be reexposed to everything you were immune to before, and this can take years,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of late March, 97% of the people sickened in the current outbreak were unvaccinated or didn’t disclose their vaccine status. The measles virus is attenuated in the MMR vaccine, meaning that it has been altered to produce the appropriate immune response without triggering the disease itself. In the case of measles, that means no mass destruction of the cells that hold the immune system’s memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t have this very, very damaging effect, which is why we recommend vaccination, because we get all of the immunity with none of the adverse consequences,” Bolotin said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 10:00:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxOZ2ZiR3RMNzhKWGJ1dGJvQjc3VklSNlVkOUJYV1hISlZEY1puWXpYTVhhdzZ4WVJGdDBFdzR6aHJ1NjMxTk1RQ2hKeHg0OUdSYzh5cTlaUVBEZ2J0X0ZKZnphYV9qYW85eXY4T2wtMjI5YkNURGZwWVVHOGdBRThBUGRXYmdveXowZWJfZlJMZzdqcTliQ2VkeVJCWXRqNUdBSGN6Y011eWpsN0FnTU12Q3FVYWhZQQ</guid></item><item><title>New Parents Set A Simple Vaccine Boundary, Extended Family Turns It Into A Political Meltdown - Bored Panda</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE9WYk5kWUZlU3lhUkplb2lyWTNnbGZacUR5X0t5OVFDeU1GMXVsUGpiMWtMQXBBYlpzR0dBRFMtVF85YklYSFFqUGduYVRHSW1zaldPQXVyWHAyU0Z4T1ZzWTVOZGpVRXVRMldxUXpoRHh6NTV5eWJV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Welcoming a new, tiny member into the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/relationships/family/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;&lt;span&gt;family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; is exciting for everyone involved. Having kids around makes the holidays feel so much more magical, and it’s always fun to have a niece, nephew or grandchild that you can spoil. But when the baby is a newborn, it’s important that all relatives take safety precautions when seeing them. Or they might not get to meet the baby at all… &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A new dad &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jnte5i/aio_for_asking_family_to_be_vaccinated_before/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;reached out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to Reddit detailing how his wife’s family took it personally when they were asked to update their vaccinations before meeting the baby.

Some of us are eager to keep up with all of our vaccinations and are first in line to get boosters when they roll out. But others are skeptical of how necessary vaccines really are. And some even believe that they cause more harm than good.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to a 2024 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648308/far-fewer-regard-childhood-vaccinations-important.aspx" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gallup Poll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, only 40% of Americans believe that it’s extremely important for parents to get their children vaccinated, and 69% say it’s very important. In 2001, however, 94% of Americans said it was very important for kids to be vaccinated, and 64% considered it to be extremely important. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the father who made this post pointed out in his text messages that he wasn’t trying to engage in a political discussion with his relatives, Gallup revealed that knowing someone’s political party might help you predict what their stance on vaccines will be. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;63% of Democrats believe vaccines are extremely important, while only a quarter of Republicans feel the same way. Meanwhile, only 36% of Republicans think the government should require vaccines, compared to over two thirds of Democrats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Skepticism about vaccines isn’t only an American issue, though.

So it’s important to exercise caution when visiting one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_2" align="center" data-pwa-ad="0" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span data-ad="empty"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/new-parents-and-newborns-are-visitors-ok#:~:text=Are%20newborns%20more%20susceptible%20to,such%20as%20sepsis%20and%20meningitis." target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Johns Hopkins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; notes on their blog that newborns are “at higher risk for developing infections from both bacteria and viruses. They are also more susceptible to developing serious infections, such as sepsis and meningitis.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To avoid passing whooping cough on to a newborn, it’s important for all visitors to be up to date with their Tdap vaccination. Johns Hopkins also recommends having a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;flu shot and making sure you’re up to date with COVID vaccinations and boosters at least two weeks before visiting a baby.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In general, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.baystatehealth.org/articles/guidelines-for-visiting-a-newborn" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Baystate Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; notes on their site that it’s probably safe for a newborn to start having visitors after about 3 months. But there are some rules to keep in mind. If anyone has been ill or exposed to illness in the past couple weeks, they should hold off on seeing the baby. It’s also important that they wash their hands well, and it might even be a good idea to wear a mask.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Never show up unannounced to visit a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/people-share-ugly-newborn-photos/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="noopener "&gt;&lt;span&gt;newborn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and if the parents have particular rules or wishes surrounding the visit, respect them. It’s always better to be safe than sorry, and at the end of the day, it’s up to Mom and Dad to decide who gets to spend time around their little one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;We would love to hear your thoughts on this situation in the comments below, pandas.

Alarming news coverage of violent crime has people on edge, &lt;a href="/videos/355797/americans-crime-pandemic-cities-belief"&gt;concerned for their safety&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;With all these anxieties coursing through modern life, you might suspect the world is a fundamentally menacing place. In 2023, 40 percent of Americans said they &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/544415/personal-safety-fears-three-decade-high.aspx"&gt;felt unsafe walking home alone&lt;/a&gt; at night, the highest rate since 1993, according to a Gallup poll. Ongoing research suggests &lt;a href="https://www.montclair.edu/newscenter/2023/12/13/study-gen-z-perceive-risk-everywhere-they-turn-early-research-shows/"&gt;Gen Z sees more risk around them&lt;/a&gt; than other generations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;You would, however, be wrong to assume that danger is everywhere. &lt;a href="/policy/356269/falling-crime-trends-public-perception-voter-concerns"&gt;Violent crime&lt;/a&gt; has been &lt;a href="/policy/366622/violent-crime-dropping-pandemic-wave-2024"&gt;down&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/podcasts/401799/airplane-crash-safety-faa-firings"&gt;air travel is as safe as it’s ever been&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/768249"&gt;mortality from infectious disease&lt;/a&gt; largely fell throughout the 20th and &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2585966"&gt;21st centuries&lt;/a&gt; (even the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic was blunted by the &lt;a href="https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2021/10/covid-19-vaccines-prevented-nearly-140000-us-deaths"&gt;swift development of effective vaccines&lt;/a&gt;). While much more can be done to ensure the safety and well-being of people, animals, and the earth, &lt;a href="/the-highlight/23627382/progress-climate-change-poverty-global-health-doom-industrial-revolution-vaccines"&gt;Americans live longer, safer, wealthier lives&lt;/a&gt; than centuries past. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Nothing is without risk, but fixating on certain perils may be misplaced, experts say. Risk and danger are non-negotiables in the great project of human existence. The line between sufficient self-preservation and excessive vigilance is thin and our own miscalculations on what actually constitutes a risk may only muddy the waters. But a life without risk is one without joys and excitements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="our-wonky-miscalculations-about-risk" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Our wonky (mis)calculations about risk &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Generations ago, risks were largely evaluated by the scientific and cultural knowledge of the day. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, some of the greatest risks came from “natural” causes: fires that razed homes and cities, infectious diseases, and unpredictable weather conditions. Absent any kind of data or expert guidance, people largely relied on their own experience — and the experiences of others — to weigh risk. If your cousin embarked on a transcontinental ocean voyage only never to return, your perception of such a trip’s risk would have been swayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But as technology advanced, around 150 years ago, the risks also proliferated. New transportation, like railroads, held hazards for both passengers and workers. Mines, factories, and other industrial-era workplaces were hotbeds of danger. In order to assess the risks of industrial labor, states began collecting data about accidents and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“It was collected to make an argument about you should pay attention to this kind of risk, that the government should step in and try to manage the risk,” says &lt;a href="https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/cas/units/departments/history/our-people/arwen-mohun/"&gt;Arwen Mohun&lt;/a&gt;, a history professor at the University of Delaware and author of &lt;a href="https://www.press.jhu.edu/books/title/10758/risk?srsltid=AfmBOorpBrYErNy9RX4AeO-sklPQWxID1Iu1lpRsh9ReHDA7mslUvSaQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Risk: Negotiating Safety in American Society&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “The first widely collected data is about public health and about workplace accidents, and those were both big political issues. The numbers were meant to shift people’s perceptions of risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;People use both numbers and stories to build a narrative around what is safe and what isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;These days, especially as mass media makes it possible to stay informed about all the bad and scary happenings the world over, data and statistics are in no short supply, documenting everything from the number of flu infections in a given year to the likelihood of winning the lottery. But the power of experience still shapes how individuals weigh risk. People &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/17456916211026896"&gt;use both numbers and stories&lt;/a&gt; to build a narrative around what is safe and what isn’t. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The problem is we’re not good at parsing either. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Trust plays a huge role in what data, experts, and firsthand accounts we take into consideration, says &lt;a href="https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/223335-jens-zinn"&gt;Jens Zinn&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Melbourne. For instance, if you’re sick and worried about the risk of getting sicker, you usually seek more information from a trusted source: perhaps a doctor. However, when people believe a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-34806-4"&gt;source of information is trying to deceive them&lt;/a&gt;, they’re less likely to trust the information, even if they know it to be true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In a time when &lt;a href="https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/trend/archive/fall-2024/americans-deepening-mistrust-of-institutions"&gt;trust in institutions is at an all-time low&lt;/a&gt;, some might turn to sometimes misleading belief systems when weighing risk, Zinn says. Those who are skeptical of science or expertise may feel like subject-matter experts are corrupt and speaking in a language they don’t understand and instead turn to what they &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; to be true, because they’ve seen it themselves or heard it online from someone who did. Perhaps they’ll turn to a content creator peddling so-called wellness cures or, a leader with convincing, but unfounded, claims about health and safety. When these messages align with your personal experiences and beliefs, they’re all the more compelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Embodied truth is something [that] is much more convincing than…abstract reasoning,” Zinn says. Unfortunately for scientists or academics who wish to sway skeptics based on facts, facts aren’t always convincing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;If all of your car rides occurred without incident, you may incorrectly believe driving carries less risk than air travel, based purely on your own history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Although data appears objective, we’re not very good at interpreting this information, says &lt;a href="https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/staff/dirk-wulff"&gt;Dirk Wulff&lt;/a&gt;, a senior research scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development. The &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/01/03/1198909057/brain-struggles-big-numbers-neuroscience"&gt;human brain is ill-equipped to process large numbers&lt;/a&gt;. While a one-in-a-million chance of developing a rare cancer is hard for our brains to digest, “people often think it’s more likely than it in reality is,” Wulff says. The same goes for evaluating risk based on our own experiences. “It’s just objectively often wrong because we haven’t made enough experiences to see some of the bad things that could happen,” Wulff says. If all of your car rides occurred without incident, you may incorrectly believe driving carries less risk than air travel, based purely on your own history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The most accurate assessment of risk, Wulff says, is to marry experience with data and expert-driven advice. But human miscalculations continually threaten that delicate balance. People tend to misjudge &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-023-02415-x"&gt;the risk for rare and extreme events&lt;/a&gt; — they choose to gamble despite the low likelihood of winning, or opt out of swimming in the ocean due to the potential of a shark attack. The &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fxge0001306"&gt;more information people have&lt;/a&gt; about the probability of experiencing a certain negative event, even if it’s high-risk, the less likely they are to perceive it as a risk. When it came to Covid-19, people considered their personal risk low, but &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8976215/"&gt;saw the virus as posing a greater threat to others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The more in control you feel, the &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229800177_The_Effect_of_Perceived_Control_on_Risk_Taking1"&gt;more comfortable you are with risk&lt;/a&gt;. “People fear cancer more and heart disease less because they think they have control over heart disease,” says &lt;a href="https://www.dropeik.com/"&gt;David Ropeik,&lt;/a&gt; author of &lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/how-risky-is-it-really-why-our-fears-don-t-always-match-the-facts-david-ropeik/8192974?ean=9780071629690"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How Risky Is It, Really?: Why Our Fears Don’t Always Match the Facts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “because the risk factors are [things] they think they can control, and the cancer fear is higher because the risk factors of things they feel they can’t. It’s wrong.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-inevitability-of-risk" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The inevitability of risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In today’s hyper-connected world, we’re inundated with stories of danger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As a part of ongoing research into Gen Z’s perception of risk, &lt;a href="https://www.montclair.edu/profilepages/view_profile.php?username=rubing"&gt;Gabriel Rubin&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of justice studies at Montclair State University, has found that an onslaught of information about a plethora of threats, like crime — from small-town kidnappings to mass shootings — and climate change has led to young people’s increased fears. “A lot of people say that ‘I could be kidnapped, I could be attacked, or crime is the worst it’s ever been,’” Rubin says. “Which isn’t true.” &lt;a href="https://www.thrillist.com/travel/nation/hotel-safety-hacks-tiktoks-essay"&gt;Watching extravagant “safety” routines on TikTok&lt;/a&gt; — videos that outline ways to intruder-proof a hotel room or home — can add to young people’s beliefs that the world is a dangerous place. “In the threat literature, they would call it availability bias,” Rubin says, “which is your bias towards something that you can imagine. With crime, they can imagine it happening to them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This tendency to assume highly publicized incidents, from plane crashes to true crime, pose &lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/availability-heuristic-2794824"&gt;more of a risk to you, personally&lt;/a&gt; isn’t limited to young people. Constant news — and noise — about risks, real and imagined, raise alarm bells for all audiences. Persistent news coverage of plane crashes, violent crime, and toxic chemicals may lead readers and viewers to assume these events are more of an imminent danger than they actually are. Non-expert commentators and content creators also peddle misinformation about nonexistent risks on TikTok — such as the &lt;a href="/even-better/354203/sunscreen-sunblock-spf-sun-damage-skin-cancer-tiktok-confusion"&gt;supposed dangers of sunscreen&lt;/a&gt; — in order to further their own agenda or to sell products. The popularity of true crime could contribute to &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0011128720922539"&gt;people’s fear of violence&lt;/a&gt; despite evidence of decreasing crime rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;Persistent news coverage of plane crashes, violent crime, and toxic chemicals may lead readers and viewers to assume these events are more of an imminent danger than they actually are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;This mismatch between what the evidence says is risky and the appropriate level of fear is what Ropeik calls the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278691512000981"&gt;risk perception gap&lt;/a&gt;. “When our fears don’t match the evidence,” he says, “the gap between our fears and the facts becomes a risk all by itself.” For instance, vaccine skeptics who fear the side effects of immunizations create a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/opinion/vaccine-hesitancy.html"&gt;greater risk of illness or death by forgoing the shots&lt;/a&gt;. Their anxieties are simply centered around the wrong thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A wealth of information may seem beneficial in allowing people to learn and gird themselves against dangers, but our system starts to short-circuit with too much data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“We’re not built for all the inputs that we’re getting,” Rubin says. “We have so much information flooding us. Our brain tries to keep us alive by emphasizing via our emotional system that this or that is scary, you should stay away from it.” But in a world where seemingly everything poses a risk, how can you discern the imminent dangers from statistical anomalies? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="living-and-coping-with-risk" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;Living — and coping — with risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Feeling constantly threatened can lead to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4211931/"&gt;perceiving more threats and increased anxiety&lt;/a&gt;. All this stress has &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5579396/"&gt;profound effects on the body&lt;/a&gt;, from increased risk of heart disease to suppressed immune system function. “Our radar screens are more constantly filled with boogeymen,” Ropeik says. “That has a biological impact. It makes every blip on the radar screen look bigger.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The result is a culture that highly regards safety. Generational shifts in child-rearing have given rise to &lt;a href="https://www.parents.com/parenting/better-parenting/what-is-helicopter-parenting/"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/parents/parents/helicopters-lawnmowers-bulldozers-fear-can-affect-parenting-rcna19201"&gt;bulldozer parents&lt;/a&gt; who emphasize protecting kids from life’s difficulties and dangers at all costs. From a young age, children learn from the adults in their lives the dangers of certain behaviors — running too fast at the playground, sleeping over a friend’s house — and start to craft a risk-free life as they grow up. The tendency to assume if something bad happens to you, it’s your fault sends the message that one must be on-guard at all times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="how-to-more-accurately-weigh-risk-in-two-steps" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 _1lbxzst3 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to more accurately weigh risk in two ste&lt;/strong&gt;ps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst6"&gt;&lt;ol class="duet--article--ordered-list _1agbrixi vryt6q0 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;li class="vryt6q1"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid forming an opinion based on gut feelings&lt;/strong&gt;: Do some research and read scientific studies in peer-reviewed journals or reports from trusted sources about the rates of the specific risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="vryt6q1"&gt;&lt;span class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask yourself why you’re frightened&lt;/strong&gt;: Is the topic capturing your attention because of news coverage or conversations on social media? Are you distrustful of the people or institutions involved? Do you feel at greater risk because of your gender or identity?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;“Ask yourself questions about what psychological or emotional filters you’re seeing the risk through,” Ropeik says. “They’re like stained-glass windows. What kind of stained-glass windows are in the way between the risk and me that are making it feel the way it does?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Meanwhile, virtual worlds and entertainment provide a supposedly risk-free alternative. Video games and social media provide “safe” environments to have vicarious experiences without the risk of physical harm. You can’t break a bone or get kidnapped if you never leave your room, never log off. Of course, social media use carries risk for &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2023/09/protecting-teens-on-social-media"&gt;negative mental&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11561428/"&gt;health consequences&lt;/a&gt; for adolescents and adults alike. And opting to spend more time alone — binge-watching, doomscrolling — &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2019/05/ce-corner-isolation"&gt;adversely impacts mental and physical health&lt;/a&gt;. “Especially this Covid generation, they think that being home is a safe space and it has no risk,” Rubin says, “and they’re suffering mentally — which is a risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Risk-aversion may be a lingering hangover effect from the pandemic. Research has found that Americans who &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/126/1/373/1901343?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;lived through the Great Depression&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1045&amp;amp;context=marketing_facpubs"&gt;the 2008 economic recession&lt;/a&gt; were less likely to take financial risks. The pandemic might have had a similar effect on risk-taking overall, says Wulff, the research scientist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Because nothing in this world is without risk — it’s possible to &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691614568352"&gt;die from loneliness&lt;/a&gt; or in your bed, fast asleep — we must learn to live with it. Some perceived risks do have positive payoffs. Exploring the world, falling in love, and changing careers are among life’s richest experiences, but they’re far from safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Taking chances and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3132556/"&gt;bouncing back from setbacks&lt;/a&gt; help build resilience and perhaps the chronically risk-averse need to feel comfortable with the possibility of short-term hurt for long-term gains. “It used to be said that [challenges] built character,” Mohun, the historian, says. “That you needed to fall off, metaphorically or literally, because you needed to know that you could get up and walk away.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Of course, there’s no need to put yourself in dangerous situations. But with the help of a mental health professional, &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/exposure-therapy"&gt;slow exposure to fear-inducing activities&lt;/a&gt; can help reduce anxiety. With each incident-free subway ride, you may be less avoidant, less likely to see danger in public spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Just because danger &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; lurk at every turn doesn’t mean life is inherently unsafe. Risk is inescapable, as are death and taxes. But avoiding it means cutting ourselves off from everything pleasurable, too. And that isn’t living — it’s limbo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vox</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxOekRlN1BZWWV4WlctbEpUNEMzaGt1alhNMUIydTNMbXJNdWwyTC1JN0hQU0VHaFlnRTFPZUZ3SWowOEZBRjA4RWd5T0RYd1l6clg1ajFJOVhJcUZmZmU5bF90a1RzdUVwNUltMzBSNHdsdUFFdVFVZUlTUzhWZVVXd21pRk80UTZRM1E</guid></item><item><title>100-year-old doctor shares 7 principles of good health and longevity - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi9wFBVV95cUxPemxNNlh2N1laUGd2ZHU4Rmhwc1U0WHhQSkFTX3ZDcDZvUGVCWHBHOVNCT0p1bmVocGdHRk9tbVFqOUE3NzBVaWo5WG01dnc5bEN6c3hIM0FvSkkyQVZ6Z0NXT0tXeC1pR1pUVm1FMFR4N0N0bzIwRmhSY19lLWxnMkl4MmdkNGJ3YXp3WTdwSm9MT05pZGpOaEJrV2Y0YzFGbUpwZkZIb2dyN2hVMWtzVGdVbDhmUGxQcGhVb1NPZjVMYzRPZE9CaE9fQzZwYW95dFI1OXRjaEVJbV9NMUpyM3pWeDAwemtKX3dFWXpid09jZmZLOE80?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it take to live a long and healthy life? A 100-year-old man, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em " data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dr John Scharenberg,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; who has spent a lifetime studying health and wellness, shares seven key principles for longevity. These are not just theories but proven lifestyle habits that have helped many people avoid chronic diseases and stay active well into old age. Here is all we need to know about these life-changing principles that can help maintain good health for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Avoid tobacco completely&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

He said in a TED Talks that the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.profiles.nlm.nih.gov/spotlight/nn/feature/smoking#:~:text=The%20report%20highlighted%20the%20deleterious,of%20smokers%20over%20non%2Dsmokers." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;1964 Surgeon General’s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; report made it clear that smoking is dangerous, yet many still struggle to quit. The doctor points out that people who avoid smoking live longer and are at a significantly lower risk of developing diseases like Alzheimer’s and heart attacks. Simply put, staying away from tobacco is one of the best decisions for longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mgid_country_osv_parent"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Say no to alcohol&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol consumption has long been debated, but new research shows that even small amounts can increase health risks. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168827822030616" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;large-scale study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; revealed that there is no truly “safe” level of alcohol. Even moderate drinking raises the risk of cancer, liver disease, and cardiovascular issues. While many believe a glass of wine is harmless, this doctor strongly advises cutting out alcohol altogether for better health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Exercise every day&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sedentary lifestyle is one of the biggest risk factors for early death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/benefits/index.html#:~:text=Immediate%20benefits&amp;amp;text=Regular%20physical%20activity%20can%20help,of%20physical%20activity%20happen%20immediately." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Regular physical activity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; helps maintain heart health, strengthen muscles, and improve mental well-being. The doctor emphasizes that midlife (ages 40-70) is the most critical time to stay active. Those who exercise daily, regardless of their weight or health conditions, tend to outlive those who remain inactive. Walking, swimming, and strength training are all great ways to stay fit and add years to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Maintain a healthy weight&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity increases the risk of almost &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/adult-overweight-obesity/health-risks#:~:text=Having%20overweight%20or%20obesity%20increases,the%20cells%20in%20your%20body." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;every major disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, including diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. However, the doctor explains that even those who are overweight can improve their health dramatically through regular exercise. He also highlights that many people overeat due to food addiction, which is similar to substance addiction. Identifying the root cause of overeating and making conscious dietary changes can significantly improve health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cut down on sugar&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excessive sugar consumption has been linked to obesity, diabetes, and even heart attacks. Many people unknowingly consume too much sugar, whether through processed foods, sweetened beverages, or even daily desserts. The doctor shares a case study of a patient whose cholesterol and triglycerides skyrocketed due to a nightly habit of eating large amounts of ice cream. Cutting back on sugar can lead to better heart health, balanced energy levels, and overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Reduce meat consumption&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A diet high in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2943062/#:~:text=Dietary%20saturated%20fat%20intake%20has,of%20cardiovascular%20disease%20(CVD)." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;saturated fat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, particularly from animal sources, can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. While many are reluctant to give up meat, health organisations now recommend prioritising plant-based foods. The American Heart Association suggests reducing saturated fat intake, which effectively promotes a more plant-based diet. The doctor highlights that a vegetarian or plant-focused diet is scientifically proven to support longevity and lower disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;World health day: Doctors share strange questions they get asked by patients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Focus on preventive health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevention is better than cure. The doctor stresses that most chronic diseases, including heart attacks, strokes, and diabetes, can be prevented through lifestyle changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6378495/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; show that lifestyle modifications can lower heart attack risk, stroke risk and diabetes risk—without the need for medication. Organizations like the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/world-health-organisation" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and the European Cardiology Society support these findings, yet many people wait for a diagnosis before making changes. Taking proactive steps today can prevent major health issues in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 09:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9wFBVV95cUxPemxNNlh2N1laUGd2ZHU4Rmhwc1U0WHhQSkFTX3ZDcDZvUGVCWHBHOVNCT0p1bmVocGdHRk9tbVFqOUE3NzBVaWo5WG01dnc5bEN6c3hIM0FvSkkyQVZ6Z0NXT0tXeC1pR1pUVm1FMFR4N0N0bzIwRmhSY19lLWxnMkl4MmdkNGJ3YXp3WTdwSm9MT05pZGpOaEJrV2Y0YzFGbUpwZkZIb2dyN2hVMWtzVGdVbDhmUGxQcGhVb1NPZjVMYzRPZE9CaE9fQzZwYW95dFI1OXRjaEVJbV9NMUpyM3pWeDAwemtKX3dFWXpid09jZmZLOE80</guid></item><item><title>Can a Chatbot Be Your Therapist?

The results show significant advantages, mainly because the bot is available 24 hours a day, which bridges the immediacy gap patients face with traditional therapy. However researchers warn that &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/i-tried-ai-for-therapy-but-there-are-limits-to-its-conversations/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:generative AI-assisted therapy;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;generative AI-assisted therapy&lt;/a&gt; can be perilous if not done right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I think there's a lot yet for this space to evolve," said Nick Jacobson, the study's senior author and an associate professor of biomedical data science and psychiatry at Dartmouth.

The participants were evaluated for their anxiety, depression or eating disorder symptoms using standardized assessments before and after the test period. For the first four weeks, the app prompted its users to engage with it daily. For the second four weeks, the prompts stopped, but people could still engage on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Study participants actually used the app, and the researchers said they were surprised by how much and how closely people communicated with the bot. Surveyed afterward, participants reported a degree of "therapeutic alliance" -- trust and collaboration between patient and therapist -- similar to that for in-person therapists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The timing of interactions was also notable, with interactions spiking in the middle of the night and at other times when patients often experience concerns. Those are the hours when reaching a human therapist is particularly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"With Therabot, folks will access and did access it throughout the course of the trial in their daily life, in moments where they need it the most," Jacobson said. That included times when someone has difficulty getting to sleep at 2 a.m. because of anxiety or in the immediate wake of a difficult moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Patients' assessments afterward showed a 51% drop in symptoms for major depressive disorder, a 31% drop in symptoms for generalized anxiety disorder and a 19% drop in symptoms for eating disorders among patients at risk for those specific conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"The people who were enrolled in the trial weren't just mild," Jacobson said. "The folks in the group were moderate to severe in depression, for example, as they started. But on average experienced a 50% reduction in their symptoms, which would go from severe to mild or moderate to nearly absent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;What makes Therabot different&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The research team didn't just choose 100-plus people who needed support, give them access to a large language model like &lt;a href="https://tech.yahoo.com/general/articles/chatgpt-beginners-guide-133303426.html" data-ylk="slk:OpenAI's ChatGPT;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;OpenAI's ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt; and see what happened. Therabot was custom-built -- fine-tuned -- to follow specific therapy procedures. It was built to watch out for serious concerns, like indications of potential &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/suicide-hotlines-crisis-hotlines-to-call-when-you-need-help/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:self-harm;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;self-harm&lt;/a&gt;, and report them so a human professional could intervene when needed. Humans also tracked the bot's communications to reach out when the bot said something it shouldn't have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Jacobson said during the first four weeks of the study, because of the uncertainty of how the bot would behave, he read every message it sent as soon as possible. "I did not get a whole lot of sleep in the first part of the trial," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Human interventions were rare, Jacobson said. Testing of earlier models two years ago showed more than 90% of responses were consistent with best practices. When the researchers did intervene, it was often when the bot offered advice outside of a therapist's scope -- as when it tried to provide more general medical advice like how to treat a sexually transmitted disease instead of referring the patient to a medical provider. "Its actual advice was all reasonable, but that's outside the realm of care we would provide."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Therabot isn't your typical large language model; it was essentially trained by hand. Jacobson said a team of more than 100 people created a dataset using best practices on how a therapist should respond to actual human experiences. "Only the highest quality data ends up being part of it," he said. A general model like &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/what-is-gemini-everything-you-should-know-about-googles-ai-tool/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Google's Gemini;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Google's Gemini&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/claude-ai-review-the-most-conversational-ai-engine/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anthropic's Claude;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Anthropic's Claude&lt;/a&gt;, for example, is trained on far more data than just medical literature and may respond improperly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Can generative AI be your therapist?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Dartmouth study is an early sign that specially built tools using generative AI can be helpful in some cases, but that doesn't mean any AI chatbot can be your therapist. This was a controlled study with human experts monitoring it, and there are dangers in trying this on your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Remember that most general large language models are trained on oceans of data found on the internet. So, while they can sometimes provide some good mental health guidance, they also include bad information -- like how fictional therapists behaved, or what people posted about mental health on online forums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"There's a lot of ways they behave in profoundly unsafe ways in health settings," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even a chatbot offering helpful advice might be &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/mental/popular-ai-tools-can-hurt-your-mental-health-new-study-finds/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:harmful in the wrong setting;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;harmful in the wrong setting&lt;/a&gt;. Jacobson said if you tell a chatbot you're trying to lose weight, it will come up with ways to help you. But if you're dealing with an eating disorder, that may be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many people are already using chatbots to &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/tried-ai-companion-help-process-130005355.html" data-ylk="slk:perform tasks that approximate the work of a therapist;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;perform tasks that approximate the work of a therapist&lt;/a&gt;. Jacobson says you should be careful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"There's a lot of things about it in terms of the way it's trained that very closely mirrors the quality of the internet," he said. "Is there great content there? Yes. Is there dangerous content there? Yes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Treat anything you get from a chatbot with the same skepticism you would from an unfamiliar website, Jacobson said. Even though it looks more polished from a Gen AI tool, it may still be unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you or someone you love are living with an eating disorder, contact the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/help-support" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Eating Disorder Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Eating Disorder Association&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; for resources that can help.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study shows that a switch of just two weeks from a traditional African diet to a Western diet causes inflammation, reduces the immune response to pathogens, and activates processes associated with lifestyle diseases. Conversely, an African diet rich in vegetables, fiber, and fermented foods has positive effects.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;This work, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03602-0" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/i&gt;, highlights the significant impact of diet on the immune system and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronic+inflammatory+conditions/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronic inflammatory conditions&lt;/a&gt; are surging across Africa, posing a growing challenge to health care systems throughout the continent. Increasing economic development, urbanization and wider availability of processed foods have accelerated the adoption of Western eating habits in Africa. To understand the health consequences of this shift, researchers from Radboud University Medical Center and KCMC University in Tanzania have studied the effects of such dietary changes on health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lifestyle diseases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventy-seven healthy men from Tanzania, both urban and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/rural+residents/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;rural residents&lt;/a&gt;, participated in the study. Some participants who traditionally ate an African diet switched to a Western diet for two weeks, while others who ate a Western diet adopted a traditional African diet. A third group consumed a fermented banana drink daily. As a control, ten participants maintained their usual diet. The researchers comprehensively analyzed the function of the immune system, blood inflammation markers, and metabolic processes at baseline, after the two-week intervention, and again four weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants who switched to a Western diet exhibited an increase in inflammatory proteins in their blood, alongside activation of biological processes linked to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/lifestyle/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;lifestyle&lt;/a&gt; diseases. Their immune cells also responded less effectively to pathogens. Meanwhile, those who switched to a traditional African diet or consumed the fermented drink showed a reduction in inflammatory markers. Some of these effects persisted even four weeks later, indicating that short-term dietary changes can have long-lasting effects.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Insights from Africa&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first study to comprehensively map the health effects of a traditional African diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Previous research has focused on other traditional diets, such as the Japanese or Mediterranean diet," says internist Quirijn de Mast from Radboudumc. "However, there is just as much to learn from traditional African diets, especially now, as lifestyles in many African regions are rapidly changing and lifestyle diseases are increasing. Africa's rich diversity in traditional diets offers unique opportunities to gain valuable insights into how food influences health."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Mast finds it remarkable how significant the effects of diet are, even after just two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The African diet includes plenty of vegetables, fruits, beans, whole grains, and fermented foods. Our study highlights the benefits of these traditional food products for inflammation and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/metabolic+processes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;metabolic processes&lt;/a&gt; in the body. At the same time, we show how harmful an unhealthy Western diet can be. It typically consists of processed and high-calorie foods, such as French fries and white bread, with excessive salt, refined sugars, and saturated fats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Inflammation is at the root of many chronic conditions, which makes this study highly relevant for Western countries as well."&lt;/p&gt;

But, a &lt;a href="https://publichealth.realclearjournals.org/perspectives/2025/03/a-blueprint-for-nih-reform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;paper published last week&lt;/a&gt;, called “A Blueprint for NIH Reform,” is circulating in academic circles as well as within the National Institutes of Health, as scientists search for hints of where the agency may go in the coming months and years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The paper has attracted a spotlight because it was written by Martin Kulldorff, a collaborator of the agency’s new director, Jay Bhattacharya, who is also on the editorial board of the publication, called the Journal of the Academy of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The blueprint has 12 proposals for the agency, which range from breaking it into pieces to changing the ways researchers are funded to conducting more long-term studies to the creation of a “Covid Commission” to investigate the agency’s handling of the pandemic.  As a whole, the proposal is something of a referendum on the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think that NIH failed us during the pandemic, and to restore trust in science, we have to change the way we operate as a scientific community, and have to change the NIH, and I think one key aspect is to be more open and transparent and have open scientific discourse,” Kulldorff said in an interview.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts on science policy who reviewed the paper for STAT said it largely relitigates the NIH’s performance during the pandemic, and is at times correct in its diagnoses of problems at the agency but is biased by Kulldorff’s personal experience. During the pandemic, Kulldorff and Bhattacharya were criticized for writing &lt;a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Great Barrington Declaration&lt;/a&gt;, an open letter they co-authored that challenged the need for most social distancing efforts and called for less stringent public health measures in the first year of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think we shouldn’t be Covid-obsessed when we think about NIH reform, and this set of proposals is. It makes sense given who the author is, right? He has an ax to grind, and I don’t blame him for having an ax to grind, but that ends up coloring the tenor of what reform would look like,” said Pierre Azoulay, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has studied the NIH and &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/04/opinion/national-institutes-health-reforms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;advocated for reform&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Several of the proposals line up with policies already put forth by the Trump administration. The paper calls for the same payment rate for indirect research costs for all institutions, a measure that the administration attempted to implement but that has been halted for now by a federal judge. It also emphasizes “academic freedom and open scientific discourse.” In an email to staff on his first day in office, Bhattacharya lists “academic freedom” as one of his top five priorities. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The paper also proposes basing decisions about making large grants on the applicant’s previous research, as opposed to proposed experiments, and providing training funding directly to universities to disburse, rather than have these awards be judged by an NIH panel. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The experts who spoke with STAT supported the idea of minimizing the time that researchers spend writing grant proposals and justifying funding. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“​​Researchers spend way too much time just chasing after money,” said Stuart Buck, the executive director of the Good Science Project, a science policy think tank. “If you look at some of the best places that did research historically, like Bell Labs, scientists had a job, they had funding, it was centrally funded. They didn’t have to spend half their time writing up proposals for why they deserved money and deserve to get a salary and deserve to have a little lab space and so forth.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But making NIH funding dependent on a researcher’s previous “first-author” publications, as Kullfdorff proposed, could also create inequities in who can apply for those funds. This approach is similar to how the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, which attempts to fund bold and innovative research, makes funding decisions. But, there are also biases in who is funded by the HHMI, the largest private funder of biomedical research, the experts said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The best predictor of whether you get a Hughes position is whether you work in the lab of somebody else who had a Hughes position, or whether you work in the lab of somebody who is in the National Academy of Sciences. So there’s a huge bias toward the in crowd,” said Jeremy Berg, an associate dean and professor at the University of Pittsburgh who previously led the National Institute of General Medical Sciences at NIH. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Berg and others noted that in areas they agreed with the proposal, like requiring projects with NIH funding to have open data, or requiring publication in journals with open peer-review, there was little reference to previously published research that examined the pros and cons of similar reform ideas. “It’s relatively easy to pose the problem, and say, ‘We just need to do this.’ Then when you actually try to think about how you would do that, it turns out that it’s flawed, and leads to all kinds of unintended consequences, and is basically unworkable,” Berg said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In particular, some outside experts were concerned about proposals that could signal retribution toward the NIH and others that disagreed with Bhattacharya and Kulldorff during the pandemic. In writing about academic freedom, Kulldorff writes that individuals should not be discriminated against on factors including vaccination history, ethical convictions, and political beliefs. That section ends by saying, “Digressions during the pandemic should be rectified.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This looks like it was a setup to punish organizations, institutions and individuals that did things during the pandemic that they don’t like,” said Keith Yamamoto, vice chancellor of science policy and strategy at the University of California, San Francisco, who recently led a group who wrote a report on &lt;a href="https://online.flippingbook.com/view/492769090/2/#zoom=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;optimizing the NIH&lt;/a&gt;. “I worry that this is a call for retribution for people who didn’t agree with what Bhattacharya wanted to do to open up society during the pandemic.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Berg said former colleagues at the NIH have been passing around the blueprint, to understand what changes might be coming to the agency. When asked if he had discussed the paper with Bhattacharya, Kulldorff responded, “you have to ask him what he thinks about these proposals.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Bhattacharya and the NIH did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But, given Bhattacharya’s connections to Killdorff and the journal, researchers have continued speculating. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you told me this is what’s getting implemented, I’d be very worried. I think that they’re not, in their current form, particularly helpful,” Azoulay said. “Of course, everyone who reads this is wondering, ‘Is this what Jay thinks? If that’s the case, then we worry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Influencers rave and promote them, all across social media. No wonder why the vitamin industry is booming. But do you really need all these supplements? Do they have side effects? While there is no dispute about the fact that vitamins are essential for our overall health, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/4-vitamins-whose-deficiencies-are-the-most-dangerous-and-worrisome/photostory/119864155.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;supplements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; may pose some undesirable side effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jaban Moore, a functional medicine doctor, based in Kansas City, who has a holistic approach towards health and medicine has revealed about the vitamin supplements he personally avoids. Dr. Moore has nearly 700k followers on Instagram. In a video shared on the platform, he spoke about the vitamins he stays away from. “Vitamins I would never take as a functional medicine doctor. The supplement world isn’t as different as big pharma sometimes. Read the labels to know what you’re taking.,” Dr. Moore warns. He also suggests some alternatives to the popular vitamins. Take a look. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong " data-ua-type="1"&gt;Vitamin B12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first vitamin supplement on Dr. Moore’s list is &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/forget-vitamin-d-this-is-what-just-20-minutes-of-sunlight-does-to-the-body/articleshow/119890213.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Vitamin B12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Vitamin B12 is essential for keeping your central nervous system healthy and supports the production of DNA and red blood cells, as well as maintains typical brain function. You can naturally get vitamin B12 from animal foods, such as meat, fish, clams, poultry, milk, and eggs. Among these, organ meats, such as liver and kidneys are high in vitamin B12. Clams also contain large amounts of vitamin B12. You can also incorporated fortified cereals, fortified nurtitional yeast, and fortified nondairy milk to meet the nutritional needs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mgid_country_osv_parent"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jaban Moore suggests not taking cyanocobalamin, which is a synthetic form of B12. “Don't use cyanocobalamin, a synthetic form of b12 that contains cyanide, requiring extra detoxification. Take methylcobalamin instead,” he suggests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Have you ever experienced side effects from vitamin supplements?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="strong " data-ua-type="1"&gt;Magnesium&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium is an essential mineral that is best for various functions, including muscle and nerve function, bone health, blood sugar regulation, sleep, and improving mood. Magnesium is found in a variety of nutrient-dense foods, such as whole grains, nuts, seeds, legumes, and several fruits and vegetables. Magnesium helps to lessen your chance of high blood pressure. Several studies have linked increased increased magnesium levels with heart disease. “Don't use Magnesium oxide or citrate unless you only want the laxative properties. To replenish magnesium levels, opt for magnesium glycinate,” Dr. Moore says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While magnesium is essential for health, taking too much can lead to side effects, such as diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and nausea. Excessive magnesium, especially in forms like magnesium oxide or citrate, can act as a laxative, causing digestive issues. High magnesium levels can also lower blood pressure, potentially leading to dizziness or fainting, and in severe cases, may cause irregular heart rhythms. Individuals with kidney disease should be particularly cautious, as impaired kidney function can lead to a dangerous buildup of magnesium in the body. To avoid these issues, it's important to stick to recommended dosages and consult with a healthcare provider before starting supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Indian Youth &amp;amp; Mental Health: BK Shivani Reveals The Truth About Depression&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="strong " data-ua-type="1"&gt;Iron &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iron is another essential nutrient, which is in charge of several important functions such as carrying oxygen throughout your body as part of red blood cells. A lack of iron can lead to iron deficiency anaemia. Anaemia can results in symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, dizziness and shortness of breath, among others. Anaemia is a serious global public health problem that particularly affects young children, menstruating adolescent girls and women, and pregnant and postpartum women. Red meat, beans, nuts, spinach, dried fruits like apricot, and liver and organ meat are rich in iron. Dr. Moore suggests, “Don't use ferrous sulfate (iron).” He says that this supplement is harsh on digestion, and can cause constipation and nausea. “Ferrous bisglycinate (iron) is gentler and better absorbed, and heme iron is the most bioavailable form,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While vitamins play a crucial role in maintaining health, it's important to be cautious when selecting supplements, as they can have potential side effects. It is important to read labels and be mindful of the ingredients in supplements. Opting for natural alternatives may be a safer and more effective approach to supporting overall wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 07:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Intermittent fasting or calorie deficit diet, which is better for weight loss? - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are on a weight loss journey, it's no secret that you are constantly looking for effective diet and workout strategies. The internet is flooded with millions of restrictive diets and hard-hitting workouts. But how do you know what’s better for you? Curating what works for you is indeed crucial. But everyone with weight loss goals must have come across interesting fasting and calorie-deficit diets. Which one is better? Well, scientists have finally unraveled the mystery. A new study has found that intermittent fasting provides greater weight loss than traditional daily calorie-restrictive diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers from the University of Colorado School of Medicine published their findings in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-01631" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed that the 4:3 plan, a popular type of &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/diet/intermittent-fasting-what-are-the-best-hours-for-intermittent-fasting/articleshow/117051664.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;intermittent fasting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; (IMF), where individuals eat freely for four days a week and follow intense calorie restriction for three days a week, had an average body weight loss of 7.6% at the one-year mark compared with 5% in the daily caloric restriction (DCR) group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though previous studies have looked into both intermittent and calorie deficit diets, they reported no notable difference between the two diet strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was surprising and exciting to me that it was better,” Victoria Catenacci, MD, co-lead author and associate professor of endocrinology at the CU School of Medicine said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more important message to me is that this is a dietary strategy that is an evidence-based alternative, especially for people who have tried DCR and found it difficult,” Catenacci added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find the best diet, the researchers randomly assigned 165 adults with overweight or obesity to either &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mgid_country_osv_parent"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4:3 intermittent fasting or calorie restriction for 12 months. Participants in the 4:3 intermittent fasting group fasted three nonconsecutive days a week, reducing their calorie intake by 80% on those days. On the other four days, they could eat freely but were encouraged to make healthy choices. The calorie restriction group, on the other hand, followed a daily calorie limit designed to cut their energy intake by 34.3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Which diet strategy do you find more appealing for weight loss?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the participants were given a free gym membership and were encouraged to exercise for 300 minutes per week. They also got group support, calorie counting guidance, and dietary recommendations (to target 55% carbs, 15% protein, and 30% fat).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;How to lose weight through intermittent fasting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of the year, participants in the intermittent fasting group had a 7.6% change in body weight. The calorie deficit group only exhibited a 5% change. 58% of those in the fasting group achieved weight loss of at least 5% at 12 months vs 47% in the calorie restriction group. Individuals in the IMF achieved great cardiometabolic outcomes including systolic blood pressure, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and fasting glucose levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also stressed that fasting does not require counting calories, and restrictive diets every single day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 06:43:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>50 Things That Exist In Real Life And Are Straight-Up Nightmare Fuel - Bored Panda</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiakFVX3lxTE5sRVZLWlJkV05Da01ZbXNTSFcyNDlHUzhhYWRDQlhVSmRGUm5iX0o3Yk83WV9tWWREMXVtRFM1UnJKNVBCWE05emVrTGs0c3A4anh4Q3FEN1dvZGhrVHY5Mko0eFFSMnh1SlE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="open-list-post-description"&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Ghosts and monsters might give us a scare, but real life has its own horrors, and they’re often much harder to escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1jn853t/what_is_the_scariest_most_terrifying_thing_that/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" class=" staff-link"&gt;Redditors&lt;/a&gt; recently shared what they believe are the most terrifying things that actually exist.

You have a daughter, she does great and is developing normally until about 6-12 months. And then her development slows. Your pediatrician is reassuring, everyone develops differently so you are okay with it. But then it progresses…she loses skills she already had. No longer speaks any words, starts having tremors and spasticity and loses purposeful movement and may start developing breathing issues or apnea. Then the seizures start. Despite maximal treatment of the symptoms there is no cure. Your previously healthy daughter is now likely unable to walk, care for herself, and can usually barely express herself. She still smiles and looks around and can be cared for well, but won’t ever recover fully. This is her life now, and your life now, and there’s nothing you could have done or can do to fix it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;F**k Rett Syndrome, it’s the f*****g worst.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="post-bottom-meta-links clearfix "&gt; &lt;span class="sources"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1jn853t/what_is_the_scariest_most_terrifying_thing_that/mkj36k7/" target="_blank"&gt; Savoodoo &lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="open-list-submission-source-separator"&gt;, &lt;/span&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-source" href="https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/medium-shot-sad-people-home_23442433.htm#fromView=search&amp;amp;page=1&amp;amp;position=19&amp;amp;uuid=1f1ba3f4-a17a-4706-b128-ae3165f4d2ee&amp;amp;query=parent+sad" target="_blank"&gt; freepik &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="report"&gt; &lt;a class="open-list-submission-report" href="" data-href="/contact-us/?report-post=https://www.boredpanda.com/reddit-post-7251-9/"&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix " data-submission-id="8451427"&gt;  &lt;p id="8451427" class="post-content-description text-open-list"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" class="image-size-full" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2149261071-67ed209f06a73__700.jpg" alt="Person in a medical setting, receiving IV therapy, wearing a red sweater and grey headscarf, depicting a scary scenario." title="Person in a medical setting, receiving IV therapy, wearing a red sweater and grey headscarf, depicting a scary scenario."&gt; &lt;span class="bordered-description with-image"&gt;Cancer.

I was vaccinated against polio as soon as it was available, and I was most likely exposed to measles and whooping cough. It was during the period when moms held get-togethers to expose their children in a semi-controlled way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I volunteer with an organization that has many events for young children. Should I get vaccinations for these old diseases now that children aren't being vaccinated for them? I don't want to suffer from a childhood disease in my late 70s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— G.R.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear G.R.:&lt;/strong&gt; People born before 1957 are so likely to have had measles, mumps and rubella (German measles) that they are assumed to be immune and do not need blood testing or booster shots, as these diseases usually provide lifelong immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The virus that causes chicken pox stays dormant in the body, sometimes for decades, before reappearing as shingles. However, shingles does not occur as a result of exposure but because of a waning immune system due to stress, aging, or a medical condition or treatment for one. Everyone over 50 should get two doses of the shingles vaccine (unless they have a medical reason not to).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Polio fortunately doesn't exist in the United States, but travelers to areas where polio is transmitted are recommended to get a booster before travel. Everyone should be up to date with pertussis (whooping cough), diphtheria and tetanus. A booster every 10 years is appropriate for those who completed the primary series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There is no reason for measles or chicken pox (or any other vaccine-preventable disease) get-togethers anymore as vaccinations are much safer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; I am a 78-year-old woman who was recently hospitalized for a critical low sodium level (115 mEq/L). I was given IV fluids to bring my levels up slowly. I am now on sodium chloride tablets three times a day and a restriction of 1,000 mL of liquids per day to bring my sodium levels up. I have also been on metoprolol and lisinopril for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;My question stems from talking with others and reading; I am wondering if one of these daily meds I am on are interfering with my sodium levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— B.R.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear B.R.:&lt;/strong&gt; It sounds like you were diagnosed with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), which is a very common cause of low sodium levels. It is treated exactly the way you are being treated, with moderate restriction of fluid and supplemental sodium chloride (salt). They will want to keep your sodium level above 130 mEq/L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There are drugs that can cause SIADH, especially antidepressants, seizure medicines, and antipsychotic drugs, but others can as well, such as many chemotherapeutic drugs for cancer and amiodarone. However, neither metoprolol nor lisinopril is likely to be affecting your sodium level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Sometimes no cause for SIADH is found, but I'm sure that your doctors looked extensively for problems in your lung and brain, as these can cause the body to release too much ADH hormone. Addison's disease (low production of cortisol from the adrenal gland) is another cause they will look for, usually with blood testing for cortisol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It can be challenging to stick to only 1 liter of fluid intake a day. I have found several support groups online where members provide help to each other. &lt;em&gt;Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 04:14:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1AFBVV95cUxQRVdOQjJBODFuZ1FzNjV4dnA0Tm5NZ3JISDBlNDhUMVVabjNWQk5XNF9VZGtwTXNiMVR4U01ZZXFEQkxaM3VPcGk1UTJDcjllRzVmVnVaVllyWEx4NGlTdGJYMWQ2MUpaRmxsc0Z0Q0cyWkZxVXRYelhORXRCN0tnaXAzNHdMWkdwX0s0X3hUQkdBNVlrcGJybmNBRFVJT0dRaHNNMjgtaGdrRW55MVZ2REZkYW93MVVVckI3QVMwamJIMDFVY0FjVGdYSTg3ejZkaTdsMw</guid></item><item><title>Measles updates, lorazepam risks and antibiotics breakthrough - Fox News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxOa2Y5SXhsczMwQTRmOG96ZFJaNHEtZFZyOXc0QzRsZ3A3eE1KLXdra3hJQ0h0WGNfdE81VnJxVTN5aGVFckRLZGtPU0dGQ3dWOGR3akFPc191enVnbHViX0otR1QyU2lBVHpYZmMwS2FzZ0dFdW1lRGFiaHBaZHNhVlc3VnJTR0YtbjgtOFN5V2vSAZYBQVVfeXFMT0s0TWtDcTR3ODB3bFpuM3Q5SjdWc0V0ZEdwalpOOXEtNDdneWhZQnpnektjQVNtV0NPaGtGLXRBUURXWklHa3M3SzZCRDROUkVTS3ZocTRjaHVScUo5ZUlsZlZjb091N2p2TWpxOUdtRWptaW9BVTFPb2tGcDBJRnhrYkJ3MVlIbnpDWDNiWWQ3SldsTGR3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Fox News</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 04:09:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxOa2Y5SXhsczMwQTRmOG96ZFJaNHEtZFZyOXc0QzRsZ3A3eE1KLXdra3hJQ0h0WGNfdE81VnJxVTN5aGVFckRLZGtPU0dGQ3dWOGR3akFPc191enVnbHViX0otR1QyU2lBVHpYZmMwS2FzZ0dFdW1lRGFiaHBaZHNhVlc3VnJTR0YtbjgtOFN5V2vSAZYBQVVfeXFMT0s0TWtDcTR3ODB3bFpuM3Q5SjdWc0V0ZEdwalpOOXEtNDdneWhZQnpnektjQVNtV0NPaGtGLXRBUURXWklHa3M3SzZCRDROUkVTS3ZocTRjaHVScUo5ZUlsZlZjb091N2p2TWpxOUdtRWptaW9BVTFPb2tGcDBJRnhrYkJ3MVlIbnpDWDNiWWQ3SldsTGR3</guid></item><item><title>NYS Health Dept: LI woman charged with 17 felonies, accused of forging children's vaccination records - News 12 - Long Island</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxORnpiV1cxeGFneXFyNnBhMXA3Q0NWYmhrRHlEM2FaYXgxZmlUZFVEQzk3UDJULTJFTHlhQWZKZ3Z1NmRJeWZvYmJXbWNFMng4V2lGeHZZZWo1Smhfc1BteFVKRzNNWUdCcGg1WWVFN3A5NFl0TFV1TEpxOVg5Z2JNdXIzWldfZ0R1cGF5Zjl6Ym5PYUM5RGJPWjNnSWFNVDA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div alignitems="normal" justifycontent="normal" direction="column" gap="1rem,1.25rem" flexwrap="nowrap" class="sc-fsYfdN hQgjIe sc-e6358465-0 dxMubp"&gt;&lt;p class="block"&gt;According to the New York State Health Department, Stephanie Mills, of Coram, was arrested by New York State Police and charged with 17 felonies for allegedly giving fake vaccination records to more than half a dozen kids for at least five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;The state Health Department says its investigation found that Mills forged the vaccination records of eight children in the Middle Country School District.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;“Creating falsified vaccination records and submitting fraudulent immunization information to schools is a selfish and dangerous act that exacerbates the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases spreading through our communities," said Erin Clary, deputy communications director of the public affairs group with the state Health Department, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;“In New York state, it’s also a crime. We appreciate the New York State Police for its assistance with this matter and will continue to work with law enforcement across the state to investigate and enforce against this serious threat to public health," said state Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Stephanie Mills did not come to the door of her home when a News 12 crew knocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;A person who answered said they had no comment about the allegations against her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News 12 - Long Island</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 02:28:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxORnpiV1cxeGFneXFyNnBhMXA3Q0NWYmhrRHlEM2FaYXgxZmlUZFVEQzk3UDJULTJFTHlhQWZKZ3Z1NmRJeWZvYmJXbWNFMng4V2lGeHZZZWo1Smhfc1BteFVKRzNNWUdCcGg1WWVFN3A5NFl0TFV1TEpxOVg5Z2JNdXIzWldfZ0R1cGF5Zjl6Ym5PYUM5RGJPWjNnSWFNVDA</guid></item><item><title>OSDH confirms measles case in OKC, identifies potential exposure site - News on 6</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxOUkMwbG8ydWVwaW9iR1hHMHZoN3NRNlRSSlZabVNITjdnYTVvU05sMU9abENFck9oanJjaVBoVVRJMG9jalBhTVB2RlpZaTFONEdyLU45VDJVSHVKc2xfZXQ3ZTBObWZZZ28wTl9LRXh1UkJfVlEwR1dOQkdRN2FDOFZUNktxbUpaODZZMHBRNEdKZklzalpmcGEyb211X1Z2bm51OUJJRTB3V1BfR2o3QzhuaWZubVlDREZPZkFacDM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnm-article gnm-ty-article"&gt;
