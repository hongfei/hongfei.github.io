						&lt;p&gt;A Dare County resident had
to sacrifice their backyard chickens after the birds tested positive for the
bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina
Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services said Monday that wild birds
that carry the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, known commonly as bird
flu, can infect domesticated birds. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;This type of HPAI virus is
considered a low risk to people, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control. However, it is highly contagious to other birds. The virus is also not
considered a food safety threat and infected birds do not enter the food
supply. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“It is likely that HPAI remains in our
resident wild bird population and in migratory waterfowl, so reports of
positive backyard flocks will likely happen on occasion,” said Dr. Mike Martin,
state veterinarian. “I encourage our commercial and backyard flock owners to
continue to follow strict biosecurity measures and if your flock is
experiencing a sudden higher-than-normal mortality rate, report it right away
to your local veterinarian or to the N.C. Department of Agriculture Veterinary
Division at 919-707-3250.” &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The state said the flock of chickens
that tested positive for bird was euthanized to prevent its spread.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;In February, a &lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/lifestyle/health/bird-flu-detected-wake-county-owl-2025/"&gt;great horned owl tested positive for bird flu in Wake County&lt;/a&gt;, according to the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission. A spokesperson for the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission confirmed the case and said one hawk and multiple geese were found dead in the same area. It marked the first case of bird flu detected in Wake County since 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;In January, the state said bird flu
was found in two commercial turkey operations in Sampson County and a layer
operation in Hyde County. &lt;/p&gt;

a low risk to people, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.
However, it is highly contagious to other birds. The virus is also not

As of late February, more than 166 million birds had been slaughtered
nationwide to limit the virus' spread when cases are found. Most were
egg-laying chickens.&lt;/p&gt;

This sickness has killed over 60 people and sickened more than a thousand, and it is occurring at the same time as an Ebola outbreak in neighboring Uganda, as well as increasing political violence within the DRC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Experts say that Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency’s dismantling of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) has stymied the response to this unidentified disease, delaying further investigations and containment efforts of additional disease outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Medical staff along the Uganda–DRC border have been terminated. Soldiers are everywhere. The laboratory built to deal with zoonotic diseases with US funding is empty,” says Tim Allen, a London School of Economics professor and tropical-disease-control expert on the ground at the border of Uganda and the DRC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-hnJNtl gxMaIG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Nidhi Bouri, the former deputy assistant administrator for global health at USAID during the Joe Biden administration who previously led disease preparedness and response efforts, says the aid cuts have created a gap in the on-the-ground response. “We don’t have the in-country presence,” she says. USAID previously provided key infrastructure and support for disease surveillance and prevention; it worked in tandem with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on complementary tasks, Bouri says. “Once a pathogen is identified, USAID was able to, historically, identify rapid ways to mitigate further spread.” By abruptly gutting USAID, the Donald Trump administration has created a vacuum that other agencies will struggle to completely fill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The US State Department did not respond to requests for comment. “CDC is monitoring the situation closely and engaging with DRC officials on what support the agency can offer,” says Centers for Disease Control spokesperson Melissa Dibble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;While the disease in the DRC is still officially unidentified, there are some conflicting theories emerging about its cause. The World Health Organization &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mystery-disease-congo-what-we-know/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mystery-disease-congo-what-we-know/"}' href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mystery-disease-congo-what-we-know/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now suspects&lt;/a&gt; that the unidentified illness could in fact be a mass-poisoning incident rather than a virus, with contaminated water as a likely source. Or, if it is a virus, it may not be novel at all; last year in the DRC, an outbreak of an unknown illness was discovered to be respiratory infections &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON547"&gt;combined with malaria&lt;/a&gt;. Local health officials, including experts at the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q94_f039QKM"&gt;hypothesize&lt;/a&gt; that this may be the case again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In 2024, the United States Congress &lt;a data-offer-url="https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2025-02/President%E2%80%99s%20Malaria%20Initiative%20in%20Africa%20USAID%20Did%20Not%20Implement%20Its%20Strategy%20to%20Prioritize%20High-Burden%20Countries%20%28Task%20No.%20441M0322%29.pdf" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2025-02/President%E2%80%99s%20Malaria%20Initiative%20in%20Africa%20USAID%20Did%20Not%20Implement%20Its%20Strategy%20to%20Prioritize%20High-Burden%20Countries%20%28Task%20No.%20441M0322%29.pdf"}' href="https://oig.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2025-02/President%E2%80%99s%20Malaria%20Initiative%20in%20Africa%20USAID%20Did%20Not%20Implement%20Its%20Strategy%20to%20Prioritize%20High-Burden%20Countries%20%28Task%20No.%20441M0322%29.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;appropriated&lt;/a&gt; $795 million for malaria control, most of which was intended to serve sub-Saharan Africa, which weathers the bulk of global malaria infections.

stimuli such as their doctor talking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers at &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/columbia-university/index.html" id="mol-66acc6d0-f861-11ef-8b5c-1b3d67a7ff59" class=""&gt;Columbia University&lt;/a&gt; analyzed 226 recent comatose patients, observing a third displayed the unique bursts - a phenomenon scientists call 'sleep spindles.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brain circuits that&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14442711/The-five-clues-afterlife-really-DOES-exist.html"&gt; are fundamental for consciousness&lt;/a&gt; are also key to how we sleep, the Columbia team explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moreover, scientists said comatose patients with this type of 'hidden consciousness' showed signs they were already on the road to recovery from their brain injuries and many dealt with fewer disabilities later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among those displaying sleep spindles, 76 percent showed some level of consciousness before leaving the hospital and over 40 percent recovered some of their neurological function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead author Jan Claassen, an associate professor of neurology, said that this discovery provides new hope for families with critically injured loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We're at an exciting crossroad in neurocritical care where we know that many patients appear to be unconscious, but some are recovering without our knowledge,' said Claassen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We're starting to lift the lid a little bit and find some signs of recovery as it's happening,' the lead study author continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists have discovered unique signals in the sleep patterns of comatose patients, revealing that they have a 'hidden' level of consciousness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The connection between certain brain circuits and sleep is&lt;span&gt; important for explaining a condition called cognitive motor dissociation, where unconscious patients still show evidence of consciousness during brain scans but have no detectable ability to respond to outside stimuli - like someone talking to them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Until now, scientists have mainly focused on EEG recordings to tell if comatose patients were still conscious in some way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These recordings test to detect abnormalities in brain waves, based on how well the person undergoing the EEG responds to a doctor's instructions, such as opening and closing their hand. However, Claassen noted that these recordings can lead to false-negative results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, the Columbia team shifted their focus to tracking the activity present in brain wave patterns during normal sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The electrical activity during sleep looks relatively chaotic, and then occasionally in some patients, these very organized, fast frequencies appear,' Claassen explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The associate professor noted that these unique bursts in the middle of all that chaos are the sleep spindles displaying hidden consciousness inside the comatose mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Spindles happen normally during sleep and they're showing some level of organization in the brain, suggesting circuits between the thalamus and cortex needed for consciousness are intact,' Claassen detailed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The thalamus acts like your brain's information relay station, while the cortex contributes to higher brain functions like memory, thinking, learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The brain activity are sleep spindles and researchers said it shows unconscious patients can still hear and understand what is happing around them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22652-thalamus"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, all of the information coming in from your body's senses (except smell) has to be processed by the thalamus before it's sent to the brain's cortex for interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the patients in Claassen's study, the spindles show that they're still hearing people talk and feel them squeeze their hand, and those sensations are still traveling to the brain's cortex where the mind reacts to what's happening - even if people sitting next to them can't see a noticeable reaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During the study, researchers examined the overnight EEG recordings of 226 comatose patients. This group also underwent more complex testing for cognitive motor dissociation. The team noted that all of these injuries were recent and their findings likely don't apply to those with long-term disorders causing unconsciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study in &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03578-x"&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt; focused specifically on sleep among patients in a coma after a recent brain injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results revealed that 87 patients displayed signs of both sleep spindles and cognitive motor dissociation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those with clear signs of the sleep spindles in their brain waves were significantly more likely to regain consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were also more likely recover from their severe brain injury with only minor neurological deficits or a moderate disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, just 19 of the 139 comatose patients who did not experience sleep spindles or cognitive motor dissociation regained any level of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I see these spindles as a way to direct more sophisticated testing to the patients most likely to benefit,' Claassen said.

I took some photos of the lines and then I decided to get my nails done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While she expected the marks would grow out by her next manicure appointment in October 2024, she was surprised to see them become more prominent and&lt;span&gt; decided to get it checked as a precautionary measure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a trip to her dermatologist and a biopsy, the health coach was diagnosed with melanoma in her finger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Michelle Tagliamonte, 58, discovered she had stage zero melanoma in her right thumb after she noticed black lines on her thumb while at a nail appointment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Tagliamonte was diagnosed with stage zero melanoma, also referred to as melanoma in situ. This stage is when the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-2ce083a0-f853-11ef-9b24-a7fd1b4ae0a6" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; cells are contained just to the epidermis - the very outer layer of the skin - and have not yet moved into the deeper layers of skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stage zero melanoma, diagnosed in about 89,000 people in 2023, is considered a non-invasive cancer, meaning it has spread to other tissues.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With a very high survival rate - 98 percent - the cancerous area is removed surgically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In most cases, treatments such as  chemotherapy are not required, but if not cured but surgery, some doctors may suggest undergoing radiation therapy to kill the cancerous cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On January 17, Tagliamonte underwent a four-hour operation during which her right thumbnail was removed and a plastic surgeon took a skin graft from the bottom of her thumb to place over the bone and tendon where her missing nail now left them exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was left with a large incision and stitches running down the side of her hand following surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She first noticed the faint lines running across her right thumb in September 2024. Images show her thumb bloodied with a large incision and stitches&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;On January 17, Tagliamonte underwent a four-hour operation to remove the cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained: '&lt;span&gt;What the dermatologist was seeing was discoloration at the base of my thumb nail and whatever was causing this black line in my nail was coming from inside the growth plate down from inside my nail.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The melanoma was in the growth plate [in my thumb] down to my first knuckle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is where they had to cut out and they had to create a skin graft so when they had to dig out the melanoma, the bone and the tendon was exposed so they had to put some flesh back in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The skin graft was pretty invasive. I will never have a thumb nail ever again but if I had let it go, I might have lost the tip of my thumb or worse so I am very grateful and it is healing well.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She will now be left without a right thumbnail for life but says there is no permanent nerve damage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; Tagliamonte said: 'I was more worried about what they were going to have to do to get rid of it and the surgery itself. This was scary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'[Since surgery], there is no permanent nerve damage. I have a scar that runs down my thumb and the skin is still healing and new skin is forming under the skin graft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She will now be left without a right thumbnail for life  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She has since spent her time healing and is now urging others to trust their own intuition and get themselves checked&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm right-handed so the worst part was not being able to use this hand. For the first couple of weeks I couldn't button my own pants or put on my own bra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has since spent her time healing and is now urging others to trust their own intuition and get themselves checked if they notice any changes in their body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I am very grateful that I caught it at stage zero and it was localized. I think it's just a matter of being diligent to get myself checked out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I would just say don't take anything for granted. I would definitely say that if you see something that is odd or different, listen to your own intuition and get it checked out,' she gratefully said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have warned of the dangers of the use of UV light used to seal some nail polish during professional manicures, saying it can potentially increase the risk of cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While some nail lamps are called 'UV' lamps and some are called LED lamps, both emit UV radiation that produce UVA rays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Excessive exposure to UV rays can damage the DNA in skin cells, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and the development of tumors, including melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While both UVA and UVB rays contribute to skin cancer, with UVB being more directly linked to sunburn while UVA can penetrate deeper into the skin and contribute to long-term damage and aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 19:11:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxQYUh4dGtzeG5GMkZkS0pQaHZGMHBZM3YyWTR1LXRqVTJBTzhZcnV2LVYyaFdCQjRnSW10bndGWUJkLUpnUmxya1Rjc2xQak1qVmdUQ1ZzRXZ3c3Vna011aXdtMUZUNC0wbElVN1p3MFU2UWVFUTNUVV9mSWZQb1ZUNUc5czVBTFB3elE3VDE1aFNlbGdEUFZ6OFF4VjNRTGkycEJKUVZB0gGrAUFVX3lxTE9ZQ0I2bVFJcnBDLU04YmNiZGtsYUtjakV3U0ZQTHNMNW13ZjdPdHJ3a3VjeXc2cXdZNl9ST2szOUFOWldhT1cyQ1VXLXFWN2hNS2w1UVYxd3hUM1lKbktkaTJ1bHlZVHJyNFF0UlVIeVZZa1JUSTZJdTFBcTd1S0xUSEFWM3NDd0JQZXNoOFdYc3d5Y3FLdnpMTm5qYVlKUktCNXhQWXBDQ0NuQQ</guid></item><item><title>75 Extremely Rare Mind-Blowing Pictures I Found Last Month That Might Just Completely And Totally Change Your Perspective On The World - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTFA2WmtpM2JPaXNXemZRZV9FTzdQX3ByZmFSY2cwcDVrdnE5SzNybTlpVks0eFotYkVEYUdKZ2NqV21GanZDQkdWQ21qOVBzNmVZbnhZVVc0UmVzdFM3cnhnWWF4SU1UUWFKRFpGMkhB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz__description

But there’s nothing inherently unsafe about genetically modified crops. What should give you pause, instead, is the potential risk of herbicide exposure — which can be an indirect result of modern GMO farming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AVW7GYNRVNBW3PBLZHT25YNJCE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/adoption-of-genetically-engineered-crops-in-the-united-states" target="_blank"&gt;most commonly grown&lt;/a&gt; GMO crops in the United States are soy and corn that are resistant to the herbicide glyphosate, which the International Agency for Research on Cancer has labeled a probable &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(15)70134-8/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;human carcinogen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="L2BXJHE3R5GBFIIPA3UXP4JIFU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Several studies have shown that consuming GMOs is not associated with elevated health risks, including cancer. But glyphosate use has &lt;a href="https://enveurope.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s12302-016-0070-0" target="_blank"&gt;risen dramatically&lt;/a&gt; in the United States since the 1990s, and we lack long-term epidemiological data about what this may — or may not — mean for our health. There is also some emerging data regarding glyphosate exposure, especially among younger children, worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RJJBTYOYOVGKZEASGFO5SDFWTI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;As we take into account what we do know, here’s my advice: GMOs are likely fine for adults to consume, especially if you minimize ultra-processed foods, which are &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/05/08/ultraprocessed-junk-food-health-risks/" target="_blank"&gt;generally linked&lt;/a&gt; to adverse health outcomes and are a common source of GMO corn and soy. For pregnant women and young children, it would be very reasonable to minimize consuming GMOs and ultra-processed foods whenever possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="6N22GIGFJNFMBPL4T6EPH7II5A" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="6N22GIGFJNFMBPL4T6EPH7II5A"&gt;What are GMOs?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MXKTOIB2MREQJJMFUQ3CPLPLBM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A GMO is an organism, such as a crop, whose genes have been selected for a superior trait. A GMO is not a modern concept. Farmers have been selectively breeding plants chosen for desired traits for thousands of years. The &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2201327119" target="_blank"&gt;entire field of Mendelian genetics&lt;/a&gt; was born from experiments crossbreeding peas to learn about gene inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3PANSPR3INA7LNJRQW57RYXJLI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For instance, have you ever found it odd that an eggplant, that large deep-purple blob, was named for an egg? It was selectively bred this way. The common &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/18/fruits-and-vegetables-used-to-look-so-different-you-might-not-even-recognize-them/" target="_blank"&gt;eggplants of centuries ago&lt;/a&gt; were actually more like small white ovals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U4I76ZWSRZANVO3ANS2XDNYEDI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Of course, our modern techniques are very different: GMOs may undergo an accelerated process of gene engineering in a laboratory to insert a new gene from another organism into the DNA. Today, the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ado9340?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" target="_blank"&gt;most common traits&lt;/a&gt; that have been widely selected in GMOs are tolerance to herbicides and insect resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="J5JJP4SKRZAI5LYQ5PSJZFHOB4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;With these GMOs, rather than having to rely heavily on mechanical weeding, farmers have used increasingly larger amounts of herbicides that don’t harm their crops. As a result, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38073334/" target="_blank"&gt;measurable quantities&lt;/a&gt; of herbicides like glyphosate have been detected in GMO grains intended for our food, animal feeds and in some areas’ drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="H6BEJU7HNZE5HKVNJ7JYI352UM" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="H6BEJU7HNZE5HKVNJ7JYI352UM"&gt;What are the health risks with GMOs?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YULCYOM5EVHAFF3KP66LJ6O7KM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4866614/" target="_blank"&gt;Human studies&lt;/a&gt; that have linked glyphosate to cancers like Hodgkin’s lymphoma predominantly evaluated farmers with high levels of occupational exposure, not people exposed via GMO consumption in daily life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BT6ZOOARB5BDBHLHGUJEIM6RTI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The National Academies of Medicine &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/23395/chapter/1" target="_blank"&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt; over 900 studies in 2016 on GMOs and did not find any evidence of elevated health risks, including cancer.

You see, &lt;strong&gt;your gut is filled with trillions of bacteria, viruses, fungi and other microbes that feed on the food you put in your body. If they’re fed well, that can be a boon for your overall health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The gut microbiome is crucial for overall well-being due to several functions like the development of the immune system, human metabolism and even cognitive function,” says &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/mediaroom/expertslisting/alma-simmons" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alma Simmons;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alma Simmons&lt;/a&gt;, RDN, LD, CDCES, a registered dietitian nutritionist at &lt;a href="https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center&lt;/a&gt;. “One of the most important functions of the microbiota is to protect the intestine against colonization by exogenous pathogens and potentially harmful microorganisms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, not every food is good for your gut and the microbes that live within it. “Gas, bloating, cramping, diarrhea and constipation are no fun,” says &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/providers/profile/anish-sheth" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Anish A.

and how to enjoy your morning brew safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Antidepressants &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antidepressants already come with a long list of side effects, and some drugs can make it harder to safely consume coffee.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jennifer Bourgeois, pharmacist and health expert at &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.singlecare.com/"&gt;SingleCare&lt;/a&gt;, warned: 'Caffeine can interact with these medications, potentially causing dangerous increases in blood pressure.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because older classes of antidepressants, such as tricyclics and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), prevent the body from properly metabolizing caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Normally, caffeine is filtered out through the kidneys as urine, but these drugs interrupt the process, leaving caffeine lingering in the body longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time this can cause a sustained high heart rate and high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr HaVy Ngo-Hamilton, clinical consultant at &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.buzzrx.com/"&gt;BuzzRx&lt;/a&gt; and pharmacist at the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/minnesota/index.html" id="mol-f78ac410-4b53-11ef-85b9-85128011d0f7"&gt;Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; Medical Center, added that&lt;span&gt; drugs like fluvoxamine, p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;henelzine (Nardil), tranylcypromine (Parnate) were the worst offenders. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The CDC estimated that one in 10 Americans over the age of 12 take antidepressants, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-5596531/Tens-millions-Americans-struggle-quit-antidepressants-extreme-lengths-quit.html" class=""&gt;adding up to around 37 million people&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts said there are no known interactions between caffeine and newer so-called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like Zoloft, Lexapro, and Prozac.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;OTC cold and allergy medications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is estimated that nearly three in four US adults use over-the-counter cold and allergy meds to tackle symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many of these contain the stimulant pseudoephedrine, which narrows blood vessels in the nasal passages to reduce swelling and congestion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, by doing this, pseudoephedrine stimulates cells in the brain responsible for the 'fight or flight' response that keeps us safe when we are under threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ngo-Hamilton warned that drinking coffee alongside these meds can exacerbate symptoms and make you feel jittery and anxious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She pointed to over-the-counter drugs such as Sudafed and Mucinex as popular products with pseudoephedrine, and recommended taking these medications two hours before or four hours after a cup of coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Diabetes medications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Drinking sugary coffee with insulin could lead to blood sugar spikes, pharmacists warned&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One in 10 Americans take insulin to manage their diabetes. And while insulin does not directly interact with caffeine, it can still clash with your morning coffee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's more like, when you drink coffee, it increases your blood sugar, especially if there's cream and sugar in it too,' Dr Ngo-Hamilton said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Your blood sugar will spike, and that is making your medication less effective.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, drinking anything with caffeine can increase insulin and blood sugar levels, according to &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/27/8/2047/23381/Caffeine-Impairs-Glucose-Metabolism-in-Type-2"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; from the American Diabetes Association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to insulin, Dr Ngo-Hamilton said people should also be mindful of the blood sugar drug metformin, which is taken by over 20 million Americans, according to the latest available data from 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ngo-Hamilton recommended keeping track of your blood sugar to determine if you should drink coffee with your medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Antibiotics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antibiotics are prescribed for a wide variety of infections, with the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-979a8d90-4b50-11ef-92e4-174ea717279c"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; estimating that more than230 million such prescriptions were written in 2022 alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, these drugs can inhibit the metabolism of caffeine, leading to increased caffeine levels in the blood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Bourgeois specifically pointed to ciprofloxacin, also known as Cipro, which is typically used for bacterial infections such as UTIs and bladder infections, infectious diarrhea, and sinus infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As with cold and allergy meds, 'this antibiotic can inhibit the metabolism of caffeine, leading to increased caffeine levels in the blood,' she warned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And just like with OTC meds, taking this drug with coffee could lead to a racing heart and feeling jittery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Blood thinners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Warfarin is the oldest and most popular blood thinner in America. However, taking it with coffee could lead to excessive bleeding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A survey by the National Blood Clot Alliance suggested that eight million Americans &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14185895/blood-clot-drug-ticagrelor-brilinta-death-strokes-heart-attack.html"&gt;take blood thinners, which are used to prevent blood clots&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Warfarin is both the oldest and most common, accounting for about a quarter of US blood thinner prescriptions, according to the Cleveland Clinic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ngo-Hamilton said caffeine can inhibit the breakdown of blood thinners, leading to more of the drug lingering in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is particularly dangerous because having too much of the drug could result in excessive bleeding, even from minor injuries like a paper cut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For warfarin specifically, Dr Ngo-Hamilton recommends waiting 'at least six to eight hours' after taking the medication to have some coffee since there is 'a very significant drug interaction between warfarin and caffeine.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Newer blood thinners like Eliuis should not cause the these interactions, she noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Blood pressure medications &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy estimated that 117 million prescriptions for beta blockers have been doled out to 26 million Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These are meant to lower blood pressure and block the effects of the hormone epinephrine, or adrenaline. This helps improve blood flow and lower heart rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Beta blockers work to reduce your heart rate so that your heart doesn't have to work as hard,' Dr Ngo-Hamilton said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But then when you drink coffee, or any caffeinated beverages, it increases your heart rate and ultimately increases your blood pressure. This is not a direct drug interaction, but it's more like counteracting the beta blocker.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She suggested taking these medications two hours before or four hours after a cup of coffee or other caffeinated drink. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Thyroid medications &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Levothyroxine, which is designed to treat an underactive thyroid - hypothyroidism - is one of America's most prescribed drugs, totaling 23 million prescriptions per year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Dr Ngo-Hamilton cautioned that taking these drugs with any type of food or water - coffee included - can reduce the amount of medication absorbed by the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7397437/"&gt;review from 2020&lt;/a&gt; found that caffeine reduced this absorption rate by as much as 50 percent.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr William Franklin, founder and medical director of &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.victorymed.com/"&gt;Victory Medical&lt;/a&gt; in Texas, told the Daily Mail that people with levothyroxine prescriptions should take the drug 'on an empty stomach with water and wait 30 to 60 minutes before having caffeine'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Alzheimer's medications &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts estimated that one in 10 US adults over the age of 65 have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Medications to treat symptoms, called cholinesterase inhibitors, prevent the breakdown of acetylcholine - a chemical that helps with memory formation and thinking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, taking these drugs with coffee tightens the blood-brain barrier, making it more difficult for the medication to reach the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ultimately, it reduces the effectiveness,' Dr Ngo-Hamilton said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She pointed to Donepezil and Rivastigmine as the most likely culprits to cause this effect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also noted that someone on these drugs should take them two hours before or four hours after coffee.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Osteoporosis medications &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Taking osteoporosis drugs like risendronate and ibandronate with coffee could increase the risk of fractures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Osteoporosis is where bones become weak or brittle over time, causing even minor stressors like coughing to fracture them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The CDC estimated that 10million Americans aged over 50 live with the condition and take medications like risendronate and ibandronate to slow bone breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, as with thyroid medications, taking these drugs with coffee can stop them being properly absorbed by the body, making them less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Ngo-Hamilton recommended waiting about two hours after taking the medication to drink coffee or eat food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Asthma medications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many of the 25 million Americans living with asthma rely on bronchodilators, a class of prescription medications that relax and widen the airways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, mixing bronchodilators such as aminophylline and theophylline with coffee could exacerbate the side effects of these drugs - like irritability and restlessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you're new on the medication, wait and see how you're doing on the medication first before you start drinking coffee because it can worsen the side effects,' Dr Ngo-Hamilton said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you do still want to drink coffee, she suggested taking these medications four hours before or after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;ADHD medications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Close to one in 10 Americans under the age of 17 have been diagnosed with ADHD, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-10764003/Adult-ADHD-sufferers-10-likely-employed-prescription-medication.html"&gt;according to CDC data&lt;/a&gt;, and about 41million prescriptions have been doled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These drugs help regulate neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine to improve focus, attention and impulse control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, taking drugs such as Adderall and Ritalin with coffee could make them less effective and lead to increased hyperactivity.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Both ADHD medications and caffeine are stimulants.

But either way, if RFK Jr.’s statement leads to more vaccinations, it’s a win. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RFK Jr.’s new op-ed is a promising change in public health messaging, but doesn’t erase his decades of vaccine hesitancy. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This statement is a huge shift from RFK Jr.’s messaging as recently as &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rfk-jr-dismisses-measles-outbreak_n_67bf5519e4b053f9e3997f53" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="last week at a Cabinet meeting" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c1e1e8e4b0bf5486407bf8" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="67bf5519e4b053f9e3997f53" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="13"&gt;last week at a Cabinet meeting&lt;/a&gt;, when he seemed to downplay the severity and called the measles outbreak “normal,”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;said both Meade and Patel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, “He either didn’t know or was purposely manipulating the situation ... and to have the leader of our health care system not either know what is the reality or who is actively lying about it is concerning ― and not just concerning, it’s terrifying,” said Patel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new messaging, while promising, didn’t come fast enough, Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For most of us in the health care and public health space, this complete 180 in his messaging feels like a weak attempt to rescue a situation that has already spiraled out of control,” added Patel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The time for this messaging was when the outbreak began. The time for this messaging was on the day we lost a child to this vaccine-preventable disease rather than weak arguments that this current measles outbreak is normal. The time for this messaging was before the Children’s Health Defense tried to push ‘natural immunity to measles’ as superior to vaccine-induced immunity,” Patel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s what still worries medical experts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccine hesitancy, increasing measles spread and questionable decisions from the current administration concern medical professionals. Below, they share their thoughts on the current measles outbreak in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measles is known as a “herald infection” because it’s the first disease that shows up when vaccination rates are low.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is what experts call a “herald infection,” because “typically, when we see an outbreak of measles, that heralds the fact that vaccine rates have dropped enough that we’re starting to see these,” Meade said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And then we may start to see other things, like polio, like mumps, other things that we haven’t seen in this country for quite some time,” added Meade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nuzzo noted that a school in &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/san-antonio-texas-school-confirms-case-of-rubella-german-measles-as-measles-rubeola-outbreak-in-state-reaches-146-vaccinations-child-death-centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-contagious-infection" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Texas reported a rubella case" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c1e1e8e4b0bf5486407bf8" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://komonews.com/news/nation-world/san-antonio-texas-school-confirms-case-of-rubella-german-measles-as-measles-rubeola-outbreak-in-state-reaches-146-vaccinations-child-death-centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-contagious-infection" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;Texas reported a rubella case&lt;/a&gt;, which is pertinent because the measles vaccine, which is known as the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine also prevents rubella infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason that measles shows up first is because it’s highly contagious, said Meade. It’s more contagious than both COVID and the flu. “It’s one of the most contagious illnesses that we see,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just to put things in perspective for people, if someone has measles and they cough or sneeze in a room, and then they leave the room, and you walk into the room two hours later, you can become infected with measles,” explained Meade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pediatricians across the country have a very deep understanding of infectious diseases and how something like measles can actually really herald a bigger problem,” said Meade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lots of measles patients in Texas are hospitalized, which is worrisome.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a lot of people in the hospital, and I have to say that is also deeply concerning, one because measles is very tough for hospitals because of the isolation that’s required [since] it’s such a contagious disease, [and] there’s so many vulnerable people in hospitals,” said Nuzzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-28-2025" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="According to data" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c1e1e8e4b0bf5486407bf8" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-28-2025" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="15"&gt;According to data&lt;/a&gt; from the Texas Health and Human Services department, 20 of 146 people are currently hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;RFK Jr. suggested in last week’s cabinet meeting that people are in the hospital for quarantine and isolation, which isn’t true, Nuzzo noted. They’re in the hospital because they’re sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, just to say that, yes, we have had a death, but we also have a lot of people in the hospital, and that means that they are ill enough to be in the hospital,” Nuzzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Jan Sonnenmair via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jan Sonnenmair via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;"We are seeing comments that this is 'normal,' or it's expected, and a death of a child from measles in the United States should never be expected because we have a way to prevent this," said Dr. Elizabeth Meade.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They worry this outbreak could impact the country’s ability to maintain our measles elimination status.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We declared measles eliminated, which is you drive down the incidence to near zero, but not necessarily zero, like 25 years ago,” said Nuzzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, the U.S. has been able to maintain its measles elimination status, but there was a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="large measles outbreak in New York" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67c1e1e8e4b0bf5486407bf8" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="16"&gt;large measles outbreak in New York&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 where the U.S. just “barely missed losing our measles elimination status, so we’ve retained it.” Nuzzo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But when we have outbreaks that spiral out of control that could imperil our measles elimination status ... I think [it] has consequences,” Nuzzo noted. “It has huge psychological consequences in terms of what kind of country we are and how committed to public health we are. That would put us on par with some of the more resource-constrained settings in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, I think it is something that we have to take quite seriously in terms of our stature,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re worried about your health or your loved ones health, there are precautions you can take.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;With measles cases cropping up throughout the country, it’s natural to be worried. But “if you’re a fully vaccinated individual [and] you are not immunocompromised, you should have no reason to be scared,” said Patel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t sure if you’ve had your measles vaccine, you can talk to your doctor about getting your titers drawn, which is a blood test that shows the level of antibodies in your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t been vaccinated or haven’t had both doses of the shot, Meade said your best bet is to get the MMR vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first MMR dose is generally given to babies at 12 months, but if you are worried about your child’s exposure, talk to your doctor about getting them the vaccine early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We do this for kids who have to travel out of the country to places that have endemic measles, and we’re certainly doing it for children who are living near the epicenters of the current outbreaks that we’re seeing,” Meade said. Generally, this is done for babies who are at least 6 months old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;Get Our Lifestyle Coverage Ad-Free&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost-control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;HuffPost is your trusted source to help you lead a better life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our reporters rely on research, expert advice and lived experiences.

One company sees that as a win-win for seniors.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;America’s aging population means that the demand for in-home care services has never been higher. One company sees that as a win-win for seniors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://seniorshelpingseniors.com/"&gt;Seniors Helping Seniors&lt;/a&gt; employs mostly retirees to provide in-home nonmedical care, support and companionship, with a team of senior care professionals who train and assist them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We do have nurses who supervise and oversee care. Most of our caregivers are retired professionals who are looking to stay active and earn a little extra money,” said Ben Chernow, owner of Seniors Helping Seniors in Bethesda, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are other franchises in Laurel, Maryland, and Springfield and Centreville, Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caregiver positions start at $20 per hour and increase to $21 per hour after completing a dementia certification course. The company said it also offers retirement benefits and flexible work schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For clients, costs vary by location and services involved, but care generally costs around $40 per hour. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seniors who are right for the job (the company says it only hires caregivers who have the compassion and interpersonal skills to build relationships) provide an advantage for those they are caring for. They are seen as peers, not just hired help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the main places we see that is people who have dementia, Often, built into that dementia is resistance to care and unwillingness to open their home to a caregiver. That resistance is something we are able to work around, because of the comfort level with somebody who is closer in age to them,” said Chernow, a former lawyer at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice, who left the legal profession to do something he said he found more fulfilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seniors Helping Seniors caregivers come from diverse backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our caregivers include former diplomats, attorneys, business executives,” Chernow said. “We actually just hired a former Olympic gymnast. It is a really diverse group of people who often don’t have a background in this. We provide them the training and knowledge they need in order to be good caregivers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seniors Helping Seniors also makes it a priority to match clients with caregivers who have compatible personalities and similar interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seniors Helping Seniors was founded in 1998 and began franchising in 2006. It now has 180 franchise operators and 350 locations in 38 states.&lt;/p&gt;

            The measles outbreak is surging in West Texas, especially in under-vaccinated communities, but it’s not just coverage with the measles vaccine that is lagging behind. The use of other key vaccines in the childhood immunization schedule has decreased too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “We are extremely concerned that all of these vaccine preventable illnesses may potentially be making a comeback … But that is, sadly, what may be a reality for us If we continue on a path of questioning legitimate science,” said Dr. Christina Johns, a pediatric emergency physician at PM Pediatrics in Annapolis, Maryland.

            Rates of pertussis, better known as whooping cough, declined after widespread vaccine use began in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/index.html#:~:text=Widespread%20use%20of%20the%20vaccine,with%20the%20pre%2Dvaccine%20era." target="_blank"&gt;1948&lt;/a&gt;. They started to rise again in the 1980s, largely due to increased surveillance and some waning vaccine immunity, but later decreased during the pandemic, when spread of many infectious diseases slowed due to masking and distancing.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Experts say declining vaccination has now lead to an uptick in cases. Last year, there were more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/media/pdfs/2025/01/pertuss-surv-report-2024_PROVISIONAL-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;35,000&lt;/a&gt; cases of whooping cough in the US, the largest number seen in more than a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/php/surveillance/pertussis-cases-by-year.html" target="_blank"&gt;decade&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Whooping cough, a contagious respiratory illness can develop into a painful, full-body cough. The coughing fits can be severe, often accompanied by a whooping sound when people try to catch their breath. Severe cases can be fatal. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/media/pdfs/2025/01/pertuss-surv-report-2024_PROVISIONAL-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Last year&lt;/a&gt; 10 people died, including six less than 1 year old.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            It most severely affects infants but the DTaP vaccine can prevent &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/cases-of-whooping-cough-on-the-rise.html" target="_blank"&gt;nine out of 10&lt;/a&gt; infants from hospitalization. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diphtheria/hcp/vaccine-recommendations/index.html#:~:text=CDC%20recommends%20routine%20DTaP%20vaccination,4%20through%206%20years" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; recommends five DTaP doses before the age of 7, with follow up boosters of Tdap in adolescence and adulthood.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/polio/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Polio&lt;/a&gt; is a contagious virus that at first may give flu-like symptoms but could in some more serious cases progress to meningitis or even paralysis. The CDC recommends four doses of the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), which is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/polio/hcp/effectiveness-duration-protection.html" target="_blank"&gt;99% effective&lt;/a&gt;, before the age of 6.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “If you drop immunization rates low enough in various areas, polio could come back,” said Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Philadelphia Children’s Hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001q3b5v39xpkv8i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Polio cases were once common in the United States and around the world. During one of the&lt;a href="https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/Documents/Diseases%20and%20Conditions/Polio%20.pdf" target="_blank"&gt; most severe outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; in 1952, the virus infected 58,000 people in the US, paralyzed more than 21,000 and killed more than 3,100. However, vaccination campaigns cut cases dramatically. The last naturally occurring case of polio in the US was in 1979.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001r3b5vapt3081a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2022, a man in Rockland County, New York, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/21/health/new-york-polio/index.html"&gt;developed a paralysis&lt;/a&gt; from polio.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001s3b5vtjjaj75g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He represented the tip of much bigger iceberg. Only one in 200 people who are infected with polio will be paralyzed by it,” said Offit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001t3b5vs98oc9h3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More of the community likely had the virus, experts say. Vaccination rates in Rockland County were only around &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/polio/county_vaccination_rates.htm" target="_blank"&gt;60%.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001u3b5v52ysbtj2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In that particular man’s ZIP code or area, immunization rates had dropped … that’s why it arose there. So let that happen elsewhere and you could see that happen again,” said Offit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Fewer vaccinations and more illnesses
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001w3b5vxrmyphe8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If vaccination rates continue to decline, the US can expect to see more cases of pneumococcal disease, Haemophilus influenzae type b, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, hepatitis, and rotavirus, according to Martinello.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7takksp00003b5v4mceql38@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Without use of the HPV vaccine, experts warn there could be an increase in HPV associated cancers, like cervical, throat and neck cancer, within the next few decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001x3b5vhz502p4j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These are all included in the routine childhood vaccine schedule – the one that US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he plans to investigate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7tcsfh700063b6mirb2ys83@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The childhood immunization schedule is decided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with input from its outside vaccine advisers. The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians and American College of Obestetricians and Gynecologists also approve the schedule. This informs the best time for children to get vaccinated depending on when they will best be able to build immunity against specific illnesses and when they could become most susceptible to diseases. The vaccines on the schedule undergo&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;studies to make sure they are safe to use with other vaccines in the schedule and safety data is continuously evaluated, according to experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001y3b5vrqaczefz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “All of these aren’t necessarily benign illnesses,” said Johns. “Everybody seems to think that these are all just mild illnesses that you have to get through. And I think that sadly, because vaccines have been such a victim of their own success, we haven’t seen a lot of these infections … so it’s it can be easy to be tricked into thinking that it’s not a big deal.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe2rkl00123b5v63hult58@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some vaccine preventable illnesses still circulate abroad, a problem which could be exacerbated by the Trump administration’s extensive funding cuts from &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/27/politics/usaid-government-spending-global-aid-dg/index.html"&gt;USAID&lt;/a&gt;, which supported immunization programs around the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “I think we’re very selfish,” said Offit. “We’re just focused on ourselves, as if what happens in the world doesn’t affect us, even if we want to be selfish about it … what happens in other places matters.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe6tc200343b5ve489wll0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Seeing the toll these illnesses can have on patients, some countries experience less hesitance with vaccination than the US does, according to experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe6tc200353b5vgklfyiuf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One of the drivers of [vaccination] success in these countries is the acute awareness that parents’ have about the potential devastation these vaccine preventable diseases may have on their children and families,” wrote Martinello.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The measles outbreak is surging in West Texas, especially in under-vaccinated communities, but it’s not just coverage with the measles vaccine that is lagging behind. The use of other key vaccines in the childhood immunization schedule has decreased too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            With lower vaccination rates, experts worry about what vaccine preventable illnesses we could see next.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Coverage with measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP), polio, and varicella, or chickenpox vaccines, all &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html?ldkjfdl" target="_blank"&gt;declined&lt;/a&gt; in more than 30 states last year compared with the year before.

            “We are extremely concerned that all of these vaccine preventable illnesses may potentially be making a comeback … But that is, sadly, what may be a reality for us If we continue on a path of questioning legitimate science,” said Dr. Christina Johns, a pediatric emergency physician at PM Pediatrics in Annapolis, Maryland.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The percentage of kindergartners who received the DTaP vaccine has steadily declined over the past &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;five years&lt;/a&gt;, leaving thousands of children vulnerable. Protection among those who are vaccinated can also &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/20/health/whooping-cough-cases-surging-human-challenge/index.html"&gt;fade over time&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001r3b5vapt3081a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2022, a man in Rockland County, New York, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/21/health/new-york-polio/index.html"&gt;developed a paralysis&lt;/a&gt; from polio.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001s3b5vtjjaj75g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “He represented the tip of much bigger iceberg. Only one in 200 people who are infected with polio will be paralyzed by it,” said Offit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001t3b5vs98oc9h3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More of the community likely had the virus, experts say. Vaccination rates in Rockland County were only around &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/polio/county_vaccination_rates.htm" target="_blank"&gt;60%.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “In that particular man’s ZIP code or area, immunization rates had dropped … that’s why it arose there. So let that happen elsewhere and you could see that happen again,” said Offit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Fewer vaccinations and more illnesses
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001w3b5vxrmyphe8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If vaccination rates continue to decline, the US can expect to see more cases of pneumococcal disease, Haemophilus influenzae type b, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, hepatitis, and rotavirus, according to Martinello.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7takksp00003b5v4mceql38@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Without use of the HPV vaccine, experts warn there could be an increase in HPV associated cancers, like cervical, throat and neck cancer, within the next few decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001x3b5vhz502p4j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These are all included in the routine childhood vaccine schedule – the one that US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he plans to investigate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7tcsfh700063b6mirb2ys83@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The childhood immunization schedule is decided by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with input from its outside vaccine advisers. The American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Family Physicians and American College of Obestetricians and Gynecologists also approve the schedule. This informs the best time for children to get vaccinated depending on when they will best be able to build immunity against specific illnesses and when they could become most susceptible to diseases. The vaccines on the schedule undergo&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;studies to make sure they are safe to use with other vaccines in the schedule and safety data is continuously evaluated, according to experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe519f001y3b5vrqaczefz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “All of these aren’t necessarily benign illnesses,” said Johns. “Everybody seems to think that these are all just mild illnesses that you have to get through. And I think that sadly, because vaccines have been such a victim of their own success, we haven’t seen a lot of these infections … so it’s it can be easy to be tricked into thinking that it’s not a big deal.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe2rkl00123b5v63hult58@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some vaccine preventable illnesses still circulate abroad, a problem which could be exacerbated by the Trump administration’s extensive funding cuts from &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/27/politics/usaid-government-spending-global-aid-dg/index.html"&gt;USAID&lt;/a&gt;, which supported immunization programs around the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “I think we’re very selfish,” said Offit. “We’re just focused on ourselves, as if what happens in the world doesn’t affect us, even if we want to be selfish about it … what happens in other places matters.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe6tc200343b5ve489wll0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Seeing the toll these illnesses can have on patients, some countries experience less hesitance with vaccination than the US does, according to experts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7pe6tc200353b5vgklfyiuf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “One of the drivers of [vaccination] success in these countries is the acute awareness that parents’ have about the potential devastation these vaccine preventable diseases may have on their children and families,” wrote Martinello.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina Department of Agriculture and the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) notified Dare County health officials on March 3 of a laboratory confirmed positive test result for Highly Pathogenic Avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 or bird flu in a backyard flock in Dare County. &lt;span id="more-331930"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="outer-1be1ad034c6eb7be1ec7a1d0754990b8 outer-mobile-content-top" id="outer-1be1ad034c6eb7be1ec7a1d0754990b8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="outer-3885d5750879c832e8cbd565056dce84 outer-content-top" id="outer-3885d5750879c832e8cbd565056dce84"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first confirmed positive in a backyard flock in Dare County. In January, HPAI was found in a commercial operation in Hyde County.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In coordination with the flock owner, the North Carolina Department of Agriculture has completed a depopulation of the flock and Dare County Department of Health &amp;amp; Human Services (DCDHHS) officials are working with state partners to respond to any potential human exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avian influenza is a disease caused by avian influenza A virus, which can affect most species of birds and some animals. While Avian flu can make people sick, it is rare and the risk to the public remains low. To date, there has been no human-to-human spread identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="outer-09a29d6f0bdec881c76ac90642b92b1f outer-mobile-content-mid" id="outer-09a29d6f0bdec881c76ac90642b92b1f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are protective actions that residents can take to protect themselves, their pets and their backyard flocks from H5N1.

						&lt;p&gt;March 3, 2020: It's the day we learned of the first confirmed COVID-19 case in our state, and the day life changed forever.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Strange words suddenly became part of our daily lexicon: Social distancing. Flatten the curve.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;We donned masks for daily tasks. Many stopped hugging family members who didn't live in the same household.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Soon, schools and church sanctuaries emptied out—as did our sidewalks, restaurants and streets. A certain solitude set in. And sadness.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;It was March 3, 2020, when Governor Roy Cooper said a man in Wake County tested positive for coronavirus. It was North Carolina’s first case of the new illness.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The patient had recently traveled to Washington state and was exposed to a long-term care facility that had reported numerous cases of coronavirus. The Wake County patient traveled through Raleigh-Durham International Airport on Feb. 22, 2020, airport officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;At that time, nine people had died from the illness in Washington state, all in the Seattle area. Washington state officials had reported 27 confirmed cases of COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/news/state/5-years-ago-nc-saw-first-covid-case-feb-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/news/state/5-years-ago-nc-saw-first-covid-case-feb-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Among the first North Carolinians the virus claimed was a Raleigh city employee, a man in his mid-30s named Adrian Grubbs.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"All this happened so fast," his wife told us then.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;She said he was a loving husband and devoted father.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Since then, more than 34,000 people in our state have died from the virus. From Jan. 1, 2020, to Sept. 9, 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/index.htm"&gt;the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics reported&lt;/a&gt; that 34,265 people in North Carolina died from Covid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;INDIANA, USA — The Indiana Department of Natural Resources Division (DNR) said they have &lt;a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/life/animals/sandhill-crane-bird-flu-deaths-indiana/417-09ba1bc6-2bdb-4535-bddf-3f5a575c68a3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;detected bird flu&lt;/a&gt; in a total of 30 counties. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flu has hit Indiana's commercial poultry and egg farms especially hard. The state Board of Animal health &lt;a href="https://www.in.gov/boah/species-information/avianbirds/highly-pathogenic-avian-influenza/2022-2023-case-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;estimates almost 7 million birds &lt;/a&gt;have been impacted by the virus at almost 40 facilities statewide. But wild birds are also at risk. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indiana DNR said they are continuing to detect highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in wild birds throughout Indiana. The Indiana DNR also said HPAI is suspected in an additional 32 counties based on reports involving the deaths of raptors, cranes and waterfowl. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"HPAI is a disease caused by an influenza virus that usually spreads among birds. It is common in wild birds, especially waterfowl, shorebirds, and raptors," the Indiana DNR Division of Fish and Wildlife said in a news release. "Notably, &lt;a href="https://www.wthr.com/article/life/animals/sandhill-crane-bird-flu-deaths-indiana/417-09ba1bc6-2bdb-4535-bddf-3f5a575c68a3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;more than 1,500 sandhill cranes have been affected by the virus&lt;/a&gt; since January, resulting in a large number of sandhill crane deaths in Greene, Jackson, Jasper, LaPorte, Newton, Starke, and Union counties."&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;If you find sick or dead wild birds, please report them &lt;a href="https://www.in.gov/dnr/fish-and-wildlife/wildlife-resources/wildlife-diseases-in-indiana/sick-or-dead-wildlife-reporting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;online here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's affecting waterfowl across the whole world," Eli Fleace, wildlife biologist for Indiana DNR, said. "It's been found in multiple different countries across a lot of different continents. It's so spread out, that it's even affected penguins down in Antarctica."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

However, he also notes, there can be wide variability regarding health and appearance among people of the same age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“You can see 70-year-olds who look like they are 50 and 70-year-olds who look like they’re 90,” says Lachs. “It’s very individualized.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Genetics, lifestyle choices and the conditions in which a person lives can affect how they age. It’s also possible for your chronological age – how many years you’ve been alive – to differ from your biological age – how old your body appears – based on biomarkers and how well your body is functioning. Even your organs can &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06802-1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;age at different rates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-the-body-change-in-your-70s" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;How does the body change in your 70s?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;While there is no “normal” way to age, certain health challenges can be more common during your 70s. By age 75, people typically receive, on average, between two to three medical diagnoses, explains Lachs; these might include arthritis, hypertension and hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Lachs says that people in their 70s can remain independent and generally healthy, depending on factors such as economic background, genetics, psychosocial environment and motivation to commit to good habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="4db95704-402d-4451-8e9a-86dd892e3bf7" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-16a696t"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Illustration: Ananya Broker Parekh/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The likelihood of hearing loss increases with age, says Lachs, though to what extent depends on the individual. About &lt;a href="https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/age-related-hearing-loss" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one in three&lt;/a&gt; people between 65 and 74 and nearly half of people older than 75 have hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;It’s also possible that your reaction time may slow down, says Lachs, but not to a concerning extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;Seventy is a great time for somebody to try something new&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jeffrey Stokes, University of Massachusetts Boston&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;People in their 70s might also experience sleep issues. Research &lt;a href="https://www.sleepmedres.org/journal/view.php?number=193" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; sleep quality decreases as age increases; &lt;a href="https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2013/04/sleep-it#:~:text=" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; found adults older than 60 had a 70% loss of deep sleep compared with people between 18 and 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;However, compared with other decades, the 70s can be a pretty stable time for health, says Dr Deborah Kado, a professor of medicine and co-director of the Stanford Longevity Center. This is especially true for women, the majority of whom already experienced swings of change when they went through &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/17/perimenopause-symptoms" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;. There will always be unforeseeable health hurdles, but these can happen at any age; what’s key, she says, is committing to healthy behaviors before you turn 70 and sticking with them after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="which-health-tests-should-you-get-regularly-in-your-70s" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Which health tests should you get regularly in your 70s?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Many health screenings recommended by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US and the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK for older adults are framed as guidance for &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/jan/24/healthy-aging-process-60s" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;adults aged 65 and older&lt;/a&gt;. The free NHS &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/nhs-health-check/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;health check&lt;/a&gt; concludes at age 74. In part, this lack of guidance explicitly aimed at older ages is due to limited research on the effectiveness of these tests, says Kado. A Harvard Medical School &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/womens-health/screening-after-age-75" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on screening after age 75 also observes that it can be difficult to provide general recommendations because individual needs at this stage can vary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Screenings become more complicated as we age, and knowing when to stop screening can be challenging, Lachs explains. If you have a family history of a disease, it can be helpful to speak with your doctor about what’s right for you and discuss the costs and benefits. For some, a screening could lead to preventative care that increases quality of life. For others, incidental findings may primarily cause anxiety and lead to invasive, minimally helpful procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;One screening Lachs does recommend for people in their 70s is a bone mineral density test, which measures bone strength and thickness. This test is a tool for &lt;a href="https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/osteoporosis/diagnosis-treatment-and-steps-to-take" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;early intervention&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/oct/22/osteoporosis-menopause-bone-density-diagnosis-treatment" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;osteoporosis&lt;/a&gt;, which becomes more common as people age. While men typically lose bone density more slowly than women, both groups lose bone mass at about the same rate by age 65 to 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="20e5e4fe-14fa-40a3-89e8-180e8f91a0fa" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":21,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Taking care of the grandchildren?

If, for example, a screening like this suggests a person is at risk for falling, Lachs can recommend that they work with a physical therapist to decrease that risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), a volunteer group of national experts, does &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007466.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; men and women be screened for colorectal cancer regularly from age 65 to 75 and for lung cancer between 50 and 80. The USPSTF also &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007463.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;observes&lt;/a&gt; that mammograms “work best” at finding cancer in women aged 40 to 74, and it’s not clear how helpful these tests are for women 75 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The NHS offers bowel cancer &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/bowel-cancer-screening/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;screenings&lt;/a&gt; for everyone aged 54 to 74. It​​ also provides lung cancer &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/lung-cancer-screening/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;screenings&lt;/a&gt; to people who have smoked between the ages of 55 and 74. The NHS also &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/breast-screening-helping-women-decide/nhs-breast-screening-helping-you-decide#:~:text" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;invites&lt;/a&gt; women aged 50 to 71 to have a breast cancer screening – though women over 71 can still make appointments to screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="which-vaccines-should-you-get-in-your-70s" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Which vaccines should you get in your 70s?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Lachs strongly recommends people stay up to date with their vaccines. He speaks with his patients about the increased importance of vaccinating as an older person; unvaccinated older adults are at a greater risk of experiencing severe illness; as we get older, it’s harder for the &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/why-vaccinations-are-vital-for-older-adults/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; to fight off infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Several vaccines are recommended for older adults, though it’s important to speak with your care provider about what is right for you. In the US, the NIH &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/immunizations-and-vaccines/vaccinations-and-older-adults" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; getting vaccinated for Covid-19, flu, pneumonia and shingles, and getting the Tdap; the latter is the vaccine for tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis, and all adults are advised to get one dose and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/imz-schedules/adult-age.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;then a booster&lt;/a&gt; every 10 years.

Instead, any type of cardiovascular exercise at modest levels will do, including actions like dancing, walking and climbing the stairs. He’s especially a fan of yoga because it helps with balance and flexibility while providing a social outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/article/2024/jun/14/what-is-social-health" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Positive, enriching relationships&lt;/a&gt; also strengthen physical and cognitive health, which promotes longevity, says Stokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;There’s no drug better than a good night’s sleep&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Dr Mark Lachs, Weill Cornell Medicine&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;As people hit 70, they tend to put less effort into casual relationships and invest more into their already closest and most rewarding connections, he explains. Often retired, they focus more on their marriages, kids and grandkids. Being a grandparent who helps out can be especially rewarding because research suggests &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;strong relationships&lt;/a&gt; that provide a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18429482/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;sense of purpose&lt;/a&gt; are even likelier to imbue health benefits, Stokes explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="d72fd489-c707-4250-8f66-299ac1aa5051" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class=" dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Illustration: Ananya Broker Parekh/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But while people in their 70s are good at focusing on their most rewarding relationships and repairing the benefits, they’re less skilled at creating and fostering new relationships, Stokes says. Targeting this area “can go a long way in reducing some of the loneliness and isolation” that can affect people’s oldest years, he explains. Close ties are great, but it can be even better to have a rich and diverse social network that can support you – especially because bereavement can become more common as we get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Lifespan can also be improved through diet – less meat and more plants, advises Lachs. A 2025 &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00793-y" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found a combination of consuming foods or supplements rich in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/feb/03/an-omega-3-dose-a-day-could-slow-ageing-process-healthspan-trial-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;omega-3 oils&lt;/a&gt; and vitamin D, combined with exercise, is a recipe for slowing biological ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Sleep is important, too. The National Institute on Ageing (NIA) and the &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/every-mind-matters/mental-health-issues/sleep/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/sleep/good-nights-sleep#:~:text=rest" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; that older adults get seven to nine hours each night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“There’s no drug I could prescribe that is better than a good night’s sleep,” Lachs says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-it-too-late-to-get-fit-after-70" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;Is it too late to get fit after 70?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Studies suggest that by adopting healthy lifestyle choices, you can “reverse a lot of damage and physiologically even appear younger than you did before you implemented those changes”, says Kado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“This is true for your 70s and beyond,” she says. “You can be in a nursing home in your 90s, start high-intensity interval training, and see over 170% increase in your thigh muscle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;According to the NIA, &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/how-can-strength-training-build-healthier-bodies-we-age" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that exercises that support endurance, balance, strength and flexibility help older adults maintain muscle mass and stay healthy and independent for longer. The NIA also emphasizes that almost anyone at any age can exercise and offers &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/exercise-and-physical-activity/exercising-chronic-conditions" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for people with chronic conditions. A 2009 &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/485271" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in JAMA Internal Medicine found that adults who started exercising between the ages of 70 and 78 were more likely to live longer and be less lonely than adults of the same age who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;But the reverse is also true. If people don’t engage in behaviors like exercising, their health will likely decline, Kado says. Some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9772844/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest that about 30% of adults over 70 have trouble with walking, climbing stairs and getting out of a chair. These results can be mitigated by exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“If you don’t use your muscles, you’re going to lose more muscle and be more likely to lose your mobility,” she says. “This can impact your mood, independence and cognitive ability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-do-you-stop-worrying-about-getting-older" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;How do you stop worrying about getting older?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Thoughts about ageing are often plagued by ageism, says Stokes. This viewpoint causes us to hyperfocus on the negative aspects of ageing, and incorrectly predict what getting older will be like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“There’s an overemphasis on decline,” he says. “People in their 70s often say that they don’t feel old, and the reason for it is that they don’t meet the definition of old we often use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Further, &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp-832261.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests people with more positive views of ageing are the ones who live longer. Kado describes a more positive view of ageing as a “type of resilience” that helps a person deal with life’s challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="16eac6c7-6d5f-4f59-bb00-5d54133bc379" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class=" dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":51,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"After being dumped at 58, I realized I was not equipped for the grief","elementId":"16eac6c7-6d5f-4f59-bb00-5d54133bc379","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2025/jan/27/gray-divorce-grief"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“Generally, my older patients who are doing super well beyond their 70s have that resilience factor,” says Kado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;We can also combat fears of getting older by embracing the positive aspects of ageing, says Stokes. For example, when it comes to mental and emotional health, people in their 70s tend to be happier and more satisfied than people in their 40s and 50s, he explains. The stress of child-rearing and work is likely gone, and they have a greater capacity to enjoy the good and ignore the bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The ultimate irony about ageism is you become the object of your discrimination,” says Lachs. “Find older role models, people in their 80s and 90s, and learn from them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 17:15:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTFBnb25LUVlhcklJR0F2M1h2ckdmUmlXV0F2X1dWYzMxQ0ZsVU5zMDZfa0dRVUxDM2NuZXNVRW55MVVGVGFGbS12OTh6VHdqV3FVT2tjWGJxUm5Bc3ZxVWw0VFFQRE16VDhiY3NJOGdvYjFBV2UyaDltek9tSHZTems</guid></item><item><title>How Louisiana poultry farms are faring when it comes to bird flu - Greater Baton Rouge Business Report</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxPRXdJZEd6SS05SmpQRzdPUVVhOUoySk4zYmtEV0RMb1RpazVRU2k3cnV4R1lmM1l5Vy1NOW9FRHNCSHlwTlJIdHlTam1nYnhaYXdqVDlJMlpsTmdHdXFOc29mOGJ5Z0xxcUhLTDRWckJGY2R0NVJUYlJqWllPZkc3Ml9MUVo1OVBoY2pBWXJQOFdzZnpwblhlbW01V28wcnFSckF3ZmFB0gGuAUFVX3lxTE5NZjlJdUZlamJDYWVPYUp0MG1RT0ZGMnlSeng3aUgzWTkyd3Mzc24wN3UtQ3VUdEpjNUdubldNOVQtQVY4b0R0Uk1kakl5UUd1YXJBTzJudU1aZEJUWTlfbDRKZ2NmWDFkd2ZoTHRWWm5xX1p6ek82M1hINmo4VFFWRC1rTl9mVGFjaS1NMGZGU0lTRFQ0SHZHczhvcWdEQ1EzZ1RIS1NLVVBScmhHQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="post-261929" class="post-261929 post type-post status-publish format-standard category-daily_report_am category-newsletters category-article lbi-lbi_email_child lbi-lbi_email_daily_report_am" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/Article"&gt;

            &lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As the nation combats high egg prices due to viral chicken deaths, Louisiana officials say the state’s poultry farmers remain unaffected, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/state/2025/03/03/louisiana-commercial-poultry-farms-untouched-by-bird-flu-officials-say/80843092007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;the USA Today network reports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The virus is in the state, killing wild bird populations, but has largely avoided commercial poultry farmers thus far. The key, experts say, may be Louisiana cattle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The U.S. Department of Agriculture is spending $1 billion in a five-pronged approach to combat this year’s predicted 40% increase in egg prices. The &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/02/26/usda-invests-1-billion-combat-avian-flu-and-reduce-egg-prices" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;announcement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; came Feb. 26, though it’s currently unclear how much of that money will reach Louisiana.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry Commissioner Mike Strain says Louisiana’s 300 commercial poultry farmers so far have avoided the virus’s deadly path. In the past 30 days alone, 139 flocks have been infected, killing 18.72 million birds &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-detections" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;nationwide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once a single chicken is infected, the entire flock must be culled, and other chicken coops miles away are at risk of the same fate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The bottom line is that if you get a house that’s infected, they will die within 36 to 48 hours—every bird there,” Strain says. “And then what happens is the amount of virus that is there generally spreads aerosolized to the next barn … if you do not shut off the fans and not stop the virus from multiplying in the barn, that virus can spread up to 8 miles away.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theadvertiser.com/story/news/state/2025/03/03/louisiana-commercial-poultry-farms-untouched-by-bird-flu-officials-say/80843092007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Read the full story.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scale stuck on the same number for months?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/03/10/health/lose-weight-by-adding-these-5-foods-to-your-diet-doctor/"&gt;Weight loss&lt;/a&gt; can get much harder after a certain point because cutting too many calories can propel your body into “starvation mode,” slowing your metabolism and storing your fat instead of burning it for fuel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even people on drugs like &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/18/health/famed-diabetes-doctor-reveals-whats-next-for-ozempic-like-drugs/"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/09/13/lifestyle/female-wegovy-users-may-have-greatest-weight-loss/"&gt;Wegovy&lt;/a&gt; have found that their weight loss progress seems to drop off after shedding 20% to 25% of their weight — a phenomenon known as the “&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/why-weight-loss-drugs-stop-working-how-to-break-past-ozempic-plateau" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ozempic plateau&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1074818" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; from the University of Southern Denmark offers some hope for altering this frustrating reality. &lt;/p&gt;

1024px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Researchers have discovered a way to potentially control the metabolic adaptation that stalls weight loss. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Liubomir – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead author &lt;a href="https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/da/persons/ravnskjaer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Kim Ravnskjaer&lt;/a&gt;, a molecular biology professor at the university, acknowledged that weight loss “usually goes well at first, but as people lose some of the weight they aim to shed, their progress stalls because the body’s metabolism adapts.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This new study suggests that we might be able to control this metabolic adaptation — which would be a total game-changer. &lt;/p&gt;


	





&lt;p&gt;“If we could develop a medication that helps maintain fat or sugar burning at its original high level alongside weight-loss treatments, people could continue losing weight beyond the usual plateau,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ravnskjaer and his team researched the role of a gene called Plvap in the livers of mice. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They were aware from previous studies that people born without this gene tend to have issues with their lipid metabolism — the processes by which the body breaks down, transports and utilizes fats (lipids) for energy, storage and cellular functions — and they wanted to explore the connection. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What they found was that this gene is largely responsible for controlling the metabolic shift of &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/24/health/lose-belly-fat-fast-just-stop-eating-this-one-type-of-food/"&gt;burning sugar to fat&lt;/a&gt; while in “starvation mode.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the gene was deactivated in laboratory mice, the liver failed to recognize the fasting state and continued metabolizing sugar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This signals there might be a way to “trick” the liver into &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/09/health/a-berry-juice-can-boost-metabolism-and-may-help-burn-fat-study/"&gt;speeding up metabolism&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If we can control the liver’s burning of sugar and fat, we might also increase the effectiveness of weight-loss and diabetes medications,”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Ravnskjaer said. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Another exciting discovery was that the mice showed no negative effects throughout the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, they seemed to have &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/31/health/experts-reveal-how-to-manage-your-blood-sugar-and-weight-d/"&gt;lower blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt; and improved insulin sensitivity. &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s well known that elevated blood sugar may lead to chronic complications for people with type 2 diabetes,” Ravnskjaer said. “Understanding Plvap could help diabetics better regulate their blood sugar in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sdu.dk/da/om-sdu/fakulteterne/naturvidenskab/nyheder/fedt-stofskifte-kim-ravnskjaer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The study’s findings&lt;/a&gt; were published Monday in the journal Cell Metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research has been limited to mice so far, and human trials are still a ways away. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is a long way from insights in mouse experiments to bringing a drug to the market — but this is obviously the potential in our research,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p data-start="144" data-end="531"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aging is often seen as an inevitable decline in strength and energy, but Richard Morgan, at 93 years old, is proving otherwise. With a body composition more typical of someone in their 40s, he has shattered expectations of what’s possible in later life. His secret? A disciplined fitness routine, a protein-rich diet, and an unyielding commitment to staying active.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p data-start="144" data-end="531"&gt;&lt;span id="more-3878"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="533" data-end="753"&gt;While many assume that maintaining muscle mass and cardiovascular fitness past a certain age is unrealistic, &lt;strong data-start="642" data-end="750"&gt;Morgan is living proof that the human body is capable of incredible adaptation—no matter how old you are&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 data-start="755" data-end="783"&gt;A Body That Defies Time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="785" data-end="1097"&gt;Researchers have been astounded by Morgan’s &lt;strong data-start="829" data-end="863"&gt;exceptional physical condition&lt;/strong&gt;. His &lt;strong data-start="869" data-end="917"&gt;heart health, muscle mass, and lung capacity&lt;/strong&gt; rival those of people half his age. Weighing &lt;strong data-start="963" data-end="979"&gt;76 kilograms&lt;/strong&gt;, his body is composed of &lt;strong data-start="1005" data-end="1036"&gt;80% muscle and just 15% fat&lt;/strong&gt;—figures that would make even younger athletes take notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1099" data-end="1341"&gt;One of the most striking indicators of his fitness is his &lt;strong data-start="1157" data-end="1204"&gt;heart rate during a 2,000-meter rowing test&lt;/strong&gt;, which peaks at &lt;strong data-start="1221" data-end="1245"&gt;153 beats per minute&lt;/strong&gt;. This level of cardiovascular endurance is virtually unheard of &lt;strong data-start="1310" data-end="1338"&gt;for someone in their 90s&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1343" data-end="1660"&gt;Experts stress that &lt;strong data-start="1363" data-end="1405"&gt;his physique isn’t just a genetic gift&lt;/strong&gt;—it’s the result of &lt;strong data-start="1425" data-end="1481"&gt;years of dedication to training and proper nutrition&lt;/strong&gt;. According to &lt;strong data-start="1496" data-end="1512"&gt;Scott Trappe&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the Human Performance Laboratory at &lt;strong data-start="1562" data-end="1587"&gt;Ball State University&lt;/strong&gt;, “The body retains its ability to adapt to exercise, even in old age.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 data-start="1662" data-end="1700"&gt;It’s Never Too Late to Get Strong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1702" data-end="1978"&gt;What makes Morgan’s journey even more &lt;strong data-start="1740" data-end="1754"&gt;remarkable&lt;/strong&gt; is that he didn’t start competitive rowing until he was &lt;strong data-start="1811" data-end="1827"&gt;70 years old&lt;/strong&gt;. Many people believe that if they didn’t build strength when they were younger, it’s too late—but Morgan’s story &lt;strong data-start="1941" data-end="1975"&gt;challenges that notion head-on&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1980" data-end="2165"&gt;Scientists studying &lt;strong data-start="2000" data-end="2040"&gt;human aging and physical performance&lt;/strong&gt; have been closely following his progress, seeing it as &lt;strong data-start="2096" data-end="2162"&gt;proof that muscle loss and decline don’t have to be inevitable&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2167" data-end="2416"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2167" data-end="2185"&gt;Bas Van Hooren&lt;/strong&gt;, a researcher at &lt;strong data-start="2203" data-end="2228"&gt;Maastricht University&lt;/strong&gt;, reinforces this idea: “The belief that growing older means inevitable decline is a myth. &lt;strong data-start="2319" data-end="2412"&gt;Morgan’s transformation proves that anyone, at any age, can regain strength and endurance&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2418" data-end="2464"&gt;The Fitness Routine That Keeps Him Strong&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2466" data-end="2618"&gt;So, how does he do it? Morgan follows a &lt;strong data-start="2506" data-end="2552"&gt;structured yet surprisingly simple routine&lt;/strong&gt;, focusing on consistency over complexity. His program includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul data-start="2620" data-end="2797"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="2620" data-end="2673"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2622" data-end="2647"&gt;Rowing for 40 minutes&lt;/strong&gt; multiple times per week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="2674" data-end="2723"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2676" data-end="2697"&gt;Strength training&lt;/strong&gt; to preserve muscle mass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="2724" data-end="2797"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2726" data-end="2749"&gt;A high-protein diet&lt;/strong&gt;, consuming &lt;strong data-start="2761" data-end="2795"&gt;over 60 grams of protein daily&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2799" data-end="3102"&gt;His &lt;strong data-start="2803" data-end="2825"&gt;nutrition strategy&lt;/strong&gt; plays a critical role in his longevity. According to &lt;strong data-start="2879" data-end="2897"&gt;Philip Jakeman&lt;/strong&gt;, professor of &lt;strong data-start="2912" data-end="2954"&gt;healthy aging and physical performance&lt;/strong&gt; at the &lt;strong data-start="2962" data-end="2988"&gt;University of Limerick&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong data-start="2990" data-end="3033"&gt;exercise combined with proper nutrition&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;strong data-start="3037" data-end="3099"&gt;the key to preserving muscle and staying strong at any age&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3104" data-end="3133"&gt;Lessons We Can All Learn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3135" data-end="3433"&gt;Morgan’s story is &lt;strong data-start="3153" data-end="3176"&gt;a powerful reminder&lt;/strong&gt; that &lt;strong data-start="3182" data-end="3248"&gt;staying fit isn’t about age—it’s about consistency and mindset&lt;/strong&gt;. While not everyone will take up rowing competitively in their 70s, his journey highlights a &lt;strong data-start="3342" data-end="3358"&gt;simple truth&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;strong data-start="3360" data-end="3430"&gt;small, regular efforts can lead to extraordinary results over time&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3435" data-end="3772" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""&gt;The takeaway? &lt;strong data-start="3449" data-end="3516"&gt;Start today, stay consistent, and choose an &lt;a href="https://glassalmanac.com/i-lost-5kg-in-2-months-by-doing-this-easy-activity/"&gt;activity&lt;/a&gt; you enjoy.&lt;/strong&gt; Whether it’s &lt;strong data-start="3530" data-end="3579"&gt;walking, lifting weights, swimming, or rowing&lt;/strong&gt;, the human body is far more adaptable than most people believe. And as &lt;strong data-start="3651" data-end="3669"&gt;Richard Morgan&lt;/strong&gt; has shown, &lt;strong data-start="3681" data-end="3771"&gt;it’s never too late to become stronger, healthier, and more energetic than ever before.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

         — 
    &lt;/cite&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7sexe95008y2cpceyiodr6d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As a measles outbreak in Texas has grown to nearly 150 cases, US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in an &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" target="_blank"&gt;opinion piece on Fox News&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday that parents should consult with health-care providers “to understand their options to get the MMR vaccine” for their children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7sf94w500063b6mzlcqqosb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy did not explicitly recommend the vaccine, but said the outbreak was a “call to action for all of us to reaffirm our commitment to public health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7sf94w500073b6mjw3jjn45@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,” Kennedy wrote. “Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7sf94w500083b6myj38r0w0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy’s statement on measles vaccination appeared in the piece after a paragraph emphasizing treatment, such as vitamin A, for people who are sick. There is no approved antiviral to treat measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7sf94w500093b6mmrrraxo8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy also wrote that health-care providers, leaders and policymakers need to ensure that “accurate information about vaccine safety and efficacy is disseminated. We must engage with communities to understand their concerns, provide culturally competent education, and make vaccines readily accessible for all those who want them.” In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1895585297351799198" target="_blank"&gt;post on X&lt;/a&gt; on Friday, Kennedy had said that HHS was providing technical support and vaccines to the state of Texas, as well as lab support, outreach materials in Low German — a language commonly used by the Mennonite community in West Texas — and daily communication with local officials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/html-embed/instances/cm7sfwzxo00073b6mx01rhdx3@published" class="html-embed" data-editable="settings" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
    
&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7sf94w5000a3b6mcgyifq9o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Still, Kennedy’s vaccine comments are in striking contrast to those from former &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/05/health/us-measles-cases-1000-bn/index.html"&gt;HHS Sec. Alex Azar&lt;/a&gt; during the last large measles outbreak in 2019: “We cannot say this enough: Vaccines are a safe and highly effective public health tool that can prevent this disease and end the current outbreak. The measles vaccine is among the most-studied medical products we have and is given safely to millions of children and adults each year. I encourage all Americans to talk to your doctor about what vaccines are recommended to protect you, your family, and your community from measles and other vaccine-preventable diseases.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7sf94w5000b3b6m9afe61iw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy has a history of antivaccine comments, including saying “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/01/politics/rfk-jr-fact-check-confirmation-heading/index.html"&gt;no vaccine is safe and effective&lt;/a&gt;” and tying vaccines to the rise in autism.  Studies have found the  &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;measles, mumps and rubella vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is safe and effective: Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective and studies have shown there’s no link between autism and the MMR vaccine. During the Texas outbreak, the US Centers for Disease Control and local health officials have continued to recommend vaccination against measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7sf94w5000c3b6mvwghdazd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, MMR vaccine coverage is declining across the country. For four years, the US has fallen short of the 95% threshold set by HHS to help prevent outbreaks of the highly contagious disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7sf94w5000d3b6m6azo5534@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The outbreak in West Texas has led to 146 measles cases since late January, the majority of them among people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status is unknown. There have been 20 patients hospitalized and one death, an unvaccinated school-age child, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. It’s the largest outbreak the state has seen in 30 years, officials say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7sf94w5000e3b6mtcy4g12k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When asked about the outbreak during President Donald Trump’s first cabinet meeting last week, Kennedy said that  “&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/27/health/kennedy-measles-outbreaks-us/index.html"&gt;measles outbreaks are not unusual.”&lt;/a&gt; However, measles was eliminated in the US in 2000. Experts say some cases are still expected — particularly imported cases associated with international travel — and the US has reported at least a dozen cases each year since reaching elimination status, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the CDC. However, infectious disease experts and local health officials said outbreaks the size and speed of the Texas outbreak are unusual since vaccination became available.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7sf94w5000f3b6mczy36vsl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the decade before the introduction of the MMR vaccine in 1963, there were 400 to 500 US measles deaths per year. Until the death of the child in Texas, there had not been a measles death in the US since &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/07/02/health/us-measles-death/index.html"&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt; and the country had not seen a measles death in a child since &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5331a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;2003&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7sf94w5000g3b6mpusjox2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles cases have risen in recent years, with 285 US cases reported last year, the most since 2019 when &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/15/health/measles-2019-us-global-cdc-who-bn/index.html"&gt;prolonged outbreaks among under vaccinated communities&lt;/a&gt; in New York threatened elimination status, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#:~:text=There%20have%20been%2016%20outbreaks,59)%20were%20outbreak%2Dassociated." target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. Declining vaccination rates are driving up the number of cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

              &lt;/div&gt;

A diverse diet was particularly effective in preventing a food allergy for those without a family history of food allergies or history of eczema. But earlier introduction of a diverse diet, at 6 months, did not show the same reduction in food allergy risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="F2GV4I2DIZCI3JGDI5A4VBB3PQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Parents filled out food consumption questionnaires when their children reached about 9 months of age.

However, this extremely rare case happened in China, and the researchers are yet to understand its underlying cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, a Chinese memory clinic diagnosed a 19-year-old with Alzheimer's disease, making him the world's youngest-ever Alzheimer's patient. The teenage boy started experiencing memory issues at 17 and with time his cognitive health deteriorated, so much so that he couldn't even complete his high school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain of the young patient was found to have shrinkage in the hippocampus involved with memory, and his cerebrospinal fluid hinted at common signs of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What made this case puzzling and unique to Capital Medical University in Beijing researchers was that the patient didn't have a gene mutation that could put his case in the case of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), which may happen in case of early onset disease. The teenager also didn't have any other disease, infection, or head trauma that could explain his sudden cognitive decline. The case was detailed in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How the memory decline began?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teenager started facing trouble focusing in his class two years before his diagnosis. Not only he found reading difficult but also faced decline in short-term memory. He also couldn't remember events from the day before, and often misplaced his belongings. The young man unfortunately couldn't complete his high school, though he could still live independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The cause remains a mystery&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to WHO, Alzheimer disease is the most common form of dementia and may contribute to 60–70% of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 10% cases of Alzheimer's disease are early onset but all the patients who are under 30 years of age can have their Alzheimer's explained by pathological gene mutations. This puts them into the category of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD). In the case of young people, the likely cause is a faulty gene. In this particular case, however, the researchers couldn't find any such mutation or gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The patient had very early-onset AD with no clear pathogenic mutations," neurologist Jianping Jia and colleagues wrote in their study, "which suggests that its pathogenesis still needs to be explored.""Exploring the mysteries of young people with Alzheimer's disease may become one of the most challenging scientific questions of the future," they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Causes of young-onset dementia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The causes of young-onset dementia are similar to the diseases that leads to dementia in older people. In case of young, as per Alzheimer's Society, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), is more common. Dementia in younger people also has different symptoms than those reported in older people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Familial Alzheimer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Familial Alzheimer’s disease is an extremely rare form of Alzheimer’s caused by inherited genetic mutations. It involves changes in three specific genes — PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP — and carries a 50% chance of being passed from parent to child. People with this condition often have a strong family history of Alzheimer’s, with symptoms typically appearing in their 30s, 40s, or 50s. The earlier the onset, the more likely the disease is linked to genetics. Overall, familial Alzheimer’s accounts for fewer than 1% of all Alzheimer’s cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt; &lt;p data-type="image" data-title="alzheimers disease" data-msid="118688283" data-hostid="83" data-src="/img/118688283/Master.jpg"&gt;&lt;msid&gt;118688283&lt;/msid&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Atypical Alzheimer's disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; Younger people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease are more likely to have an atypical form, where the symptoms differ from the typical memory loss seen in older adults. In posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), early signs involve problems processing visual information, such as difficulty reading or judging distances. In logopenic aphasia, language difficulties appear first, with individuals struggling to find the right words or pausing frequently during speech. Meanwhile, behavioural/dysexecutive Alzheimer’s disease tends to start with problems in planning, decision-making, and socially inappropriate behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Older adults infected with COVID-19 at higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease: Study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 14:57:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>JFK International Airport on red alert as foreign traveler imports deadly disease and infects untold number - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxNT1dORVZOa1NETzNVMWJtQ1RXWEd3LVNuWTNjeWRiU08xSnNQNk5leGVOM0hfQmlkVG1wYU43a1B5aHp5ZExjdFJxc291dFNRc29VOU1Cek1pb3FQWUZrNHJ2alJIRlNicGNtZzdwaUJueVZXU2ZfU2lTQWstNjdoVjM4TVZJbnJNck42TmNlZmpCc1hVX09rczhmUmdKZGIxUHYwNtIBqgFBVV95cUxNcVZvbTUzUlBZcFZYbm8waVhSdzZBdDl1M1V6cGdIZlY4OG42SGo3MWxWSWFpT2loVHRieDVVU3FpaGd1RzFsMHVaQWxLdVdrbDMza19GcE13aVV0b1RlWk5ucDZZYUdvZWpuaTV3MzlQTncza3BmVUotbjdTbEVBUTJHS0VtRE1mV19TcUg0V3ZwbUloX083SWFrc3BCUW9ISGRXNG4wU3A0UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Health officials have &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6536883/Measles-fears-New-Jersey-airport.html" class=""&gt;warned about a potential measles outbreak at New York's JFK International Airport.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A child who entered the country on a &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/china/index.html" id="mol-3b4e85b0-f83d-11ef-8208-d9edec91456a" class=""&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; Airlines flight has tested positive for the highly contagious disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After arriving at Terminal 4, the patient traveled on a shuttle bus to Philadelphia where they visited two clinics and were eventually diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anyone who was on the shuttle bus on February 25 between 9.30pm and 3.15am is being urged to get tested for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who were also at a clinic in Collegeville, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pennsylvania/index.html" id="mol-92f21e20-f839-11ef-8208-d9edec91456a" class=""&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, on February 26 from 11.45am to 2.15pm, and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia King of Prussia campus, from 12.52am to 3.02pm, are also being advised to get tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials are now working to trace patients who may have crossed paths with the child, who is a US national but had not been vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes after &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14443287/us-airport-disease-lockdown-deadly-illness.html"&gt;a passenger at LAX who arrived on a Korean Air flight&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eating a version of the low-carbohydrate, high-fat ketogenic diet for six months led to an anti-inflammatory shift in immune cell populations among people with stable, &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-rrms/"&gt;relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (RRMS) in a Phase 2 trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These changes were accompanied by metabolic alterations in the immune cells that researchers believe could influence their activation state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings were detailed by Michael Kornberg, MD, PhD, assistant professor of neurology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, at the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) Forum 2025, held Feb. 27-March 1 in West Palm Beach, Florida, and online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The bottom line to me is that it is just further evidence that you really can modify immune phenotypes [characteristics] with dietary interventions,” Kornberg said in a talk titled, “&lt;a href="https://www.abstractsonline.com/pp8/#!/20973/presentation/600"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A Six-Month Ketogenic Diet Alters The Immune And Metabolic Landscape In Multiple Sclerosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Immune cell activity and MS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro-inflammatory immune cell activity plays a key role in driving autoimmune diseases including &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS), in which the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy parts of the brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metabolic processes, including the chemical reactions through which energy is produced, influence immune cells’ activation state. Researchers believe therapeutics that modify immune cell metabolism could benefit people with MS or other autoimmune conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;“&lt;/b&gt;If you can modify metabolism with drugs, then theoretically you can also do it with dietary interventions,” Kornberg said. But while animal studies have indeed indicated that diet can influence immune responses, “rigorous evidence in humans has been quite sparse,” he noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the diets proposed to be of possible benefit in MS is the &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/living-with-ms/ms-diet-nutrition/healthy-eating-ms/#Special_MS_Diets"&gt;ketogenic diet&lt;/a&gt;, a type of low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet that leads to ketosis, a state in which the body burns fat instead of sugar to produce energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The modified Atkins diet, or MAD, is a less restrictive version of the ketogenic diet that doesn’t require the same degree of carbohydrate limitation, and may therefore be “more palatable for long-term adherence,” Kornberg said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A now-completed &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03718247"&gt;Phase 2 study (NCT03718247)&lt;/a&gt; evaluated the potential benefits of a six-month MAD diet in 65 relapsing MS patients with stable disease, ages 12-55.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/93/6/637"&gt;Results showed&lt;/a&gt; that it led to significant improvements in physical function, life quality, and body composition, as well as reductions in fatigue and depression. Patients also reported an &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2023/08/02/benefits-ketogenic-diet-rrms-may-be-long-lasting-if-adherence/"&gt;easing of a number of other MS-related symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers examined blood and immune cells collected from 39 trial participants at the start of the study and after six months on the MAD diet, aiming to characterize the diet’s effects on immune cell function and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The composition and gene activity profiles of immune cell subsets were substantially altered after six months on the MAD diet and generally showed a shift toward an anti-inflammatory profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myeloid cells, including dendritic cells and monocytes, exhibited reduced activity of genes associated with pro-inflammatory pathways. They also produced fewer pro-inflammatory molecules after the six-month diet, and levels of such molecules circulating in the blood were reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diet was also associated with alterations in the abundance of various types of T-cells, favoring less inflammatory populations. In particular, regulatory T-cells, which have anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing the activation of other immune cell types, exhibited an increased abundance with the diet and showed signs of being more active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Levels of B-cells, a class of antibody-producing immune cells believed to drive inflammation in MS, were not altered with the diet, but these cells showed gene activity changes consistent with decreased activation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional analyses of blood metabolites showed that the six-month MAD diet altered a variety of metabolites, including ones related to cellular energy production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data suggested that the metabolic pathways immune cells used for energy generation were altered with the diet. Before the diet, the cells seemed to favor breaking down sugar for energy (glycolysis), whereas after it, they favored using fat molecules (fatty acid oxidation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was evidenced by reduced levels of GLUT1, a molecule involved in transporting sugar into cells, after the six-month diet, along with increases in CPT1a, an enzyme involved in fatty acid oxidation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kornberg said these altered pathways are “ones that you would expect to be particularly relevant for immune cell activation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether these immune cell alterations are enough to influence clinical outcomes for MS patients is not yet known, nor is it clear exactly through which mechanisms MAD might influence immune function, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-term safety of ketogenic diets in patients also remains to be established, “which is a critical point if a patient is thinking about embarking on this,” Kornberg said.&lt;/p&gt;

Officials said that child may have exposed people to the illness, including in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The child was in Philadelphia from 9:30 p.m. Tuesday to 3:15 a.m. Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They arrived at the Pho Ha Saigon restaurant, 757 Adams Ave. in Philadelphia, on a China Airlines Airport Shuttle Bus that came from Terminal 4 at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The child then was at True North Pediatrics Associates of Plymouth, 3031 Walton Rd., #C101, in Plymouth Meeting on Wednesday, and then at the CHOP King of Prussia Campus Emergency Department on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who were at any of these locations during the identified time periods may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Investigators are completing contact tracing in coordination with the health care systems above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identified individuals are in the process of being contacted and notified of potential exposure to measles and assessed for vaccination status and risk for infection. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles virus can remain in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the area. If someone breathes in the contaminated air or touches an infected surface and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth, they can become infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know Your Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine is safe and highly effective at preventing measles. For individuals who are properly immunized against measles, the risk of getting the disease is minimal. Individuals who believe they were exposed should:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Review their immunization and medical records to determine if they are protected against measles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consult with their health care provider about receiving measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) immunization if they have not had measles infection or received the measles immunization previously. Contact and notify their health care provider as soon as possible about a potential exposure if they are pregnant, have an infant (child under the age of 1 year old), have a weakened immune system, and/or are not vaccinated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Monitor themselves for illness with fever and/or an unexplained rash, cough, congestion or runny nose, or red watery eyes (conjunctivitis) from 7 days to 21 days after their exposure (the time period when symptoms may develop). If symptoms develop, stay at home and call a health care provider immediately.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles is a reportable disease in Pennsylvania. If you suspect that you or your child have measles and wish to seek care, please call your health care provider, urgent care, or hospital emergency room before leaving home, or contact the Office of Public Health at 610-278-5117 to facilitate a safe visit and reduce exposure for staff and other patients. Health care providers should report suspected cases of measles immediately to the Montgomery County Office of Public Health at 610-278-5117 or after hours at 610-635-4300.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Individuals are considered to be immune to measles if any of the following applies:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;They were born in 1957 or earlier.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They have had 2 doses of Measles, Mumps, Rubella (MMR) vaccine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They have had measles disease. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The following groups of people are potentially susceptible to measles:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Infants who are too young to have been immunized (less than one year of age).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Children who are only partially vaccinated (less than 6 years old).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persons who were vaccinated with an inactivated or unknown type of vaccine, which was used from 1963 through 1967, and have not been revaccinated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some persons born after 1957 who have only received one dose of vaccine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those who have refused vaccination&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Those from areas of the world where there is low vaccine coverage or currently circulating measles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Immune-compromised persons, such as organ transplant recipients, patients receiving chemotherapy and people living with HIV/AIDS.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Individuals who meet the above criteria or cannot verify their immune status should consult with their primary healthcare provider about the best way to protect themselves from measles. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Measles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Measles is an extremely contagious virus that lives in the mucus membranes of the nose and throat of infected people. Measles can be transmitted from person to person through coughing and sneezing. If a healthy person breathes the contaminated air or touches an infected surface, then touches their eyes, nose or mouth they can become infected. When an infected person sneezes or coughs, droplets spray into the air and those droplets can contain active and contagious virus which will last in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles typically begins with a fever (100.4 degree Fahrenheit or higher) that lasts for several days, followed by a cough, runny nose, and watery eyes (conjunctivitis). Two to three days after symptoms begin, tiny white spots (Koplik spots) may appear in the mouth. Three to five days after symptoms begin, a flat red spotted rash appears beginning on face at the hairline and spreads downwards to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. The flat red spots may also be joined by small, raised bumps. Symptoms appear about seven to 14 days on average after exposure but can be as long as 21 days.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles is preventable with two doses of MMR vaccine which is available at your local healthcare provider or pharmacy. The Montgomery Office of Public Health can assist by providing recommendations for testing, outbreak prevention, and disease management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For questions, call the Montgomery County Office of Public Health at 610-278-5117.

Researchers monitored participants as a randomized sampling and had them take a combination of 2,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D and one gram of omega-3 fatty acids daily while participating in a 30-minute strength training routine three times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After three years of collecting blood samples, DNA extractions, and telephone calls, researchers found that 777 of those who took just the omega-3 supplement were able to lower their biological age by an estimated four months, while those who did all three saw even more significant results and were able to reduce their cancer risks by 61% while also improving their overall health. Additionally, 13% saw a reduction in infections with just the omega-3 dose, and 10% saw a reduction in falls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is biological age?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biological age is a term used to describe how our body ages in relation to the number of candles we have on our birthday cake each year. “[It] refers to how old our cells are and how well our tissues are functioning, which can be different from our actual chronological age,” says Suzanne Hyslop, nutrition specialist at &lt;a href="https://oceanrecoverycentre.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ocean Recovery Centre;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ocean Recovery Centre&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “It is influenced by our genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does omega-3 affect aging?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="http://www.drgoodenowe.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dayan Goodenowe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dayan Goodenowe&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Ph.D., a neuroscientist known for his work on prodromes, which are the early biochemical indicators of disease, the primary omega-3 found in human physiology is docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). “DHA is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that is essential for maintaining the youthful fluidity of the body’s membranes,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while our bodies can make DHA from the essential omega-3 dietary fatty acid, as we get older, Goodenowe says our ability to make DHA decreases and the oxidative stress on our bodies increases. “These two factors contribute to our membranes becoming stiffer and less pliable as we age, in other words, ‘older.’"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dietary supplementation of DHA helps reduce the effects of aging on our membranes by ensuring that the body’s membranes have optimal DHA levels, he notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3s also have anti-inflammatory properties, according to Hyslop, which may also contribute to the aging process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can vitamin D and strength training slow biological aging?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strength training is not just about muscle growth, Goodenowe says. It’s also about increasing bone density. He says that this type of exercise can stimulate your bones to grow stronger to meet the demands of your muscles, combatting some of the frailty we associate with aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a44536812/best-time-to-take-vitamin-d/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;most of us &lt;/em&gt;aren’t getting enough in our daily diets without adding a supplement, according to Goodenowe, which means the majority of people are already at a deficit, which may put our health at risk at any age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vitamin D is essential for bone health and immune function,” Hyslop adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can you really keep your body from aging?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because getting older and losing function appear to go hand in hand, Goodenowe says we equate aging with a loss of function. As such, he says we think that aging &lt;em&gt;causes &lt;/em&gt;this loss of function, like a disease. Instead, he believes the opposite is true, and it’s the “loss of function” that causes aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To slow aging you need to focus on maintaining function,” he says. That means staying on top of diet and exercise and adding supplements to your diet to compensate for the things your changing body needs as you get older. After checking with your healthcare provider first, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyslop agrees. “Physical activity, sleep, stress management, and avoiding harmful habits like smoking are also important,” she continues. “Staying socially connected and mentally active contributes to overall well-being, which can positively influence biological aging but this is often overlooked.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dietary supplements are products intended to supplement the diet. They are not medicines and are not intended to treat, diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or cure diseases. Be cautious about taking dietary supplements if you are pregnant or nursing. Also, be careful about giving supplements to a child, unless recommended by their healthcare provider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE1qWVFrc0VtT25rUnhZXzZjQXdDMGI3YTRhRFJUNjhBbU82TE9uTGkybHZqM04zOE03a3RlZ2lqams2T0tteF8zWEpGNGpoNXNDcE13MnpmLUJtWUc3am9naTdmX3Vmc0pJZjZMMTR1Q0R2Sy12S05rWQ</guid></item><item><title>A simple diet change can reverse arthritis within eight weeks, says Stanford expert - The Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most painful and debilitating conditions affecting your joints and their movements, arthritis can be difficult to manage and live with. There are over 100 types of arthritis, but two major types - osteoarthritis develops with age, and rheumatoid arthritis - an autoimmune condition are more talked about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to managing the chronic joint condition, diet can play an important role. But can certain changes in your dietary pattern reverse arthritis? A leading rheumatology expert believes it’s possible. Dr. Tamiko Katsumoto, a clinical associate professor at Stanford University, claims that switching to an anti-inflammatory diet could make a huge difference in just eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking on a recent episode of the ZOE Health podcast to Jonathan Wolf, Dr Katsumoto explained how certain simple dietary changes could not only reduce pain and stiffness but also "reverse arthritis in eight weeks".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to manage or slow down arthritis can make a great difference as one is able to carry out their day-to-day tasks with ease and also able to do exercises recommended by experts, which can further support joint health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Katsumoto spoke about the foods that can play an important role in managing and potentially reversing arthritis symptoms. Here’s what to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Katsumoto, said that although there was no cure for arthritis, certain factors like diet, lifestyle changes and medicine, can help slow down its symptoms and manage them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expert agrees that it's possible to reverse arthritis with the right foods. She said: "I think the biggest myth is that there's nothing you can do to change your arthritis course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think there are actually a lot of things that we are all capable of doing through diet, lifestyle, etc, that can make a difference."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The right diet for arthritis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Katsumoto, says the right changes in diet can help in reversing arthritis symptoms in eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the right diet for arthritis, she says switching to an anti-inflammatory diet could have a "profound impact".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said that inflammatory foods, like processed products, can raise the risk of getting a chronic health condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mediterranean diet (MD) as an anti-inflammatory is advised by The American College of Rheumatology for people with arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Katsumoto was all praise for the Blue Zone diet, which includes a lot of plant-based foods, fish, grains, seeds, nuts, pulses, beans and lentils., and cuts out dairy and meat products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Best vegetables for arthritis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expert said the 'best' anti-inflammatory vegetables were "cruciferous vegetables" like broccoli, kale, cauliflower, and deep leafy greens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arthritis can affect hands and wrists, knees, hips, feet and ankles, shoulders, and lower back (lumbar spine). Some of the common symptoms of arthritis include joint pain, stiffness or reduced range of motion, swelling, skin discoloration, tenderness or sensitivity to touch around a joint, and a feeling of heat or warmth near your joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some types of arthritis can have symptoms in waves that come and go called flare-ups while others make your joints feel painful or stiff all the time, or after being physically active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arthritis can develop for many reasons, ranging from natural wear and tear to immune system malfunctions. Osteoarthritis is often linked to aging, as years of joint use gradually wear down cartilage. Gout can occur when excess uric acid builds up in the blood, while autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis happen when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy joints. In some cases, viral infections — including Covid-19 — can also trigger arthritis symptoms. And in certain instances, arthritis develops without any clear cause, a condition known as idiopathic arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Katsumoto also talked about Plants for Joints as an exciting randomized controlled trial that tested a six-pillar lifestyle intervention in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and metabolic-associated osteoarthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 16 weeks, participants followed changes in diet, exercise, stress management, sleep, social connection, and substance avoidance. By the eight-week mark, patients showed dramatic improvements in joint symptoms, with rheumatoid arthritis patients seeing significant reductions in disease activity scores. While the program addressed multiple lifestyle factors, diet appeared to play the biggest role in these improvements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think diet played a huge role. And what they did was they educated these patients on whole food plant-based diets. So minimizing processed foods, minimizing or mostly eliminating animal products, increasing fiber intake, and really trying to encompass a very healthy whole food diet. The same thing was done for osteoarthritis," said the expert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Seeds for arthritis&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Katsumoto says chia seeds and flax seeds are perfect foods as they are high in fibre, omega-3, and protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They've just got so many great components that I add them to my smoothies. I just try to incorporate them wherever I can. I get a big bottle of them and add them wherever I can," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Oily fish&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another superfood that can reduce inflammation according to the expert is omega-3 fatty acids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That being said, I also encourage my patients to not go too heavy on fish, to eat the smaller fish, so not so much the tuna and the swordfish, you know, things that are much larger and can end up bio accumulating things like heavy metals and toxins," she said during the podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Go easy on the eggs: 'Egg-cess' consumption linked to diabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 13:14:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Get caught up on measles shots before spring break, Colorado state epidemiologist says - The Denver Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihAFBVV95cUxNQmZoUVNKbklKNXh2NDlmQll6bGFoaC1vb0dtZlR3eXhzS043NXJyNXRxbEtCWUtEeUZhUXQwYS1BY1dOZlJ6SnVudmk2WnZGNEUtcnY3eTZPc2tBLWNKbGhXVXA2YnlOZ0poRnJXbkZDYmVydHJRRWN6OTdrX1gtYUJ6ZW_SAYoBQVVfeXFMUHg5bkRlOG9FR1FCdk5sVHVTZVRjbm1KYzJuNElJcm5ZaEo5WDJFa1hhVk90Y3RPbXY1UUM1VVRUZS1uVWJzR3M2OWozbEl4V3J1NkJIME1aSGVRdE5RMWtOd0QwOFBmVWVZb2JEMjlaazlDb0ZfdkZ2Y0NUU0xKUW9MT1VUTjRDNVpn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-copy"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-remixd-voice-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upcoming spring break trips will give the current measles outbreak in Texas and New Mexico a chance to grow, making it particularly important for people who are behind on their shots to catch up now, Colorado’s state epidemiologist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are seeing a concerning increase in measles cases across the country, including in states neighboring Colorado,” Dr. Rachel Herlihy said in a news release. “As Coloradans prepare for spring break and travel, it’s crucial to ensure you and your family are protected against this highly contagious and serious disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of late last week, 164 people in the United States had confirmed cases of measles — more than halfway to last year’s total of 285 in just the first two months of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of those cases, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-28-2025"&gt;146 were in Texas&lt;/a&gt;. Some private schools in the area had to temporarily close because so many children were sick or quarantined, and the health department for the city of Lubbock estimated about three-quarters of its staff was working on the outbreak, &lt;a href="https://www.healthbeat.org/2025/02/21/measles-outbreak-spreads-west-texas-new-mexico/?utm_source=Healthbeat&amp;amp;utm_campaign=af7cea22dd-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2025_02_27_08_56&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_-af7cea22dd-1297580565&amp;amp;mc_cid=af7cea22dd&amp;amp;mc_eid=6818060210"&gt;according to Healthbeat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unvaccinated school-aged child in Texas became the first pediatric patient to die of measles in the United States since 2003. The &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/generalinfectiousdisease/114392?xid=nl_mpt_DHE_2025-02-26&amp;amp;mh=cb749f9dbd5470c1317620ae93c2ec2a&amp;amp;zdee=gAAAAABm4vg-k6dL2McqgKzW6iYcQLIhRsw8Z3U-v1TLMF6Gkk4jRIm37DsX8JgcEOO0hI5qoDg_sFzLHDYDJO-HDsppFII3R-n6aDnB7J9sqpot7tHDHtU%3D&amp;amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Daily%20Headlines%20Evening%20-%20Randomized%202025-02-26&amp;amp;utm_term=NL_Daily_DHE_dual-gmail-definition"&gt;last adult death&lt;/a&gt; was in 2015. Before the measles vaccine came on the market, 400 to 500 people died from the disease in an average year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;most likely to cause complications&lt;/a&gt; in children younger than 5 and adults older than 20. It also can be dangerous during pregnancy, causing premature birth in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles virus lingers in the air and on surfaces for about two hours. Typically, if a measles patient in the contagious phase spent time in a room, nine out of 10 people without immunity who move through that room in the following hours also will get sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One dose of the measles vaccine reduces the odds of getting sick by about 93%, and two doses reduce it by 97%. People who survived measles also typically develop lifelong immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people won’t need a booster shot, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. Adults vaccinated before 1968 should get another shot, because the version of the vaccine used then was less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone isn’t sure whether they were vaccinated or when it happened, they can get another shot, state health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Usually, children receive their measles shots when they’re about 1 year old and before they start kindergarten. Families who plan to take infants who are between 6 months and 1 year on an international trip should consider getting the shot early, because the virus is more common outside the United States, according to the state health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC estimated about 88.3% of Colorado kindergarteners had their shots to prevent measles, mumps and rubella, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html?utm_source=Healthbeat&amp;amp;utm_campaign=af7cea22dd-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2025_02_27_08_56&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_-af7cea22dd-1297580565&amp;amp;mc_cid=af7cea22dd&amp;amp;mc_eid=6818060210#cdc_data_surveillance_section_8-previous-years"&gt;tying the state for the sixth-lowest vaccination rate&lt;/a&gt;. When about 95% of the population is vaccinated, the virus has difficulty finding new hosts, and outbreaks tend to fizzle out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even highly vaccinated states can have vulnerable pockets, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In New Mexico, 95% of kindergarteners had the measles vaccine in the most recent school year, but &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/"&gt;nine people in a county bordering the epicenter of the Texas outbreak&lt;/a&gt; have gotten sick with the virus. Seven other states with varying vaccination rates also had a handful of cases this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the &lt;a href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/immunization/school-and-child-care-data"&gt;Colorado school districts with the lowest vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; are in rural parts of the state, though the Colorado Springs area also could be vulnerable. Fewer than 80% of kindergarteners in Manitou Springs School District had both doses of the measles vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates didn’t break down neatly along ideological lines in Colorado. Both the Boulder Valley School District and the Douglas County School District reported more than 95% of their kindergarteners had both measles shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 5% of people infected so far this year nationwide had at least one dose of the vaccine. The remaining 95% includes unvaccinated people and some whose records weren’t available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One in five people infected in the current outbreaks received hospital care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/person-dies-measles-west-texas-outbreak-rcna193812"&gt;Despite statements by U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt;, hospitals don’t provide quarantine services for measles patients — only those sick enough to need inpatient treatment get a bed. Kennedy has spread debunked claims about the vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella, despite studies looking at hundreds of thousands of children that found &lt;a href="https://www.healthbeat.org/2024/07/29/4-ways-vaccine-skeptics-mislead-you-on-measles-and-more/?utm_source=Healthbeat&amp;amp;utm_campaign=af7cea22dd-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2025_02_27_08_56&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_term=0_-af7cea22dd-1297580565&amp;amp;mc_cid=af7cea22dd&amp;amp;mc_eid=6818060210"&gt;those who received the measles vaccine were no more likely to develop autism than those who didn’t&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About one in 20 children who get measles develops pneumonia, and one in 1,000 has brain swelling that can result in hearing loss or intellectual disabilities. Kids also can become dehydrated and are vulnerable to secondary infections, because the measles virus also &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/inside-immune-amnesia"&gt;attacks antibodies to other diseases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients who have measles can start spreading the virus about four days before the distinctive rash develops, when their symptoms look much like other respiratory diseases: a high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have those symptoms should call their health care provider before coming in, so they can take precautions to limit other people’s exposure, according to the state health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://myaccount.denverpost.com/dp/preference"&gt;Get more Colorado news by signing up for our Mile High Roundup email newsletter.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;19-year-old&lt;/strong&gt; from China has been diagnosed with &lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD)&lt;/strong&gt;, making him the youngest known patient ever recorded. The case challenges current medical assumptions about how and why the disease develops, especially in younger individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Rare Diagnosis at an Unprecedented Age&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Typically associated with the elderly, &lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/strong&gt; is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that leads to cognitive decline and memory loss. Early-onset cases—those appearing before the age of 65—account for &lt;strong&gt;about 10%&lt;/strong&gt; of diagnoses. However, almost all cases in young patients are linked to genetic mutations associated with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alzforum.org/early-onset-familial-ad/overview/what-early-onset-familial-alzheimer-disease-efad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;familial Alzheimer’s disease &lt;/a&gt;(FAD)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;teenage patient&lt;/strong&gt; had no family history of dementia, no genetic markers of the condition, and no prior infections or head trauma that could explain his symptoms. Yet, by the time he was referred to a &lt;strong&gt;memory clinic&lt;/strong&gt;, his cognitive abilities had already deteriorated significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Unexplained Progression of Symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The patient first began experiencing memory issues &lt;strong&gt;at 17&lt;/strong&gt;, struggling with concentration and recall. Over time, his short-term memory worsened—he often forgot events from the previous day and misplaced belongings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By the time he was 19, tests showed that his &lt;strong&gt;memory function was severely impaired&lt;/strong&gt;, with his recall ability scoring nearly&lt;strong&gt; 87% lower&lt;/strong&gt; than his peers. MRI scans revealed &lt;strong&gt;shrinkage in the hippocampus&lt;/strong&gt;, a key brain region responsible for memory, while cerebrospinal fluid tests indicated the presence of &lt;strong&gt;biomarkers &lt;/strong&gt;linked to Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What Makes This Case Unique?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before this case, the youngest confirmed Alzheimer’s patient was &lt;strong&gt;21 years old&lt;/strong&gt; and carried a mutation in the &lt;strong&gt;PSEN1 gene&lt;/strong&gt;, which leads to toxic protein buildup in the brain. This newly diagnosed teenager, however, &lt;strong&gt;had no detectable genetic abnormalities&lt;/strong&gt;, making his case even more mysterious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long known that Alzheimer’s is &lt;strong&gt;not a one-size-fits-all disease&lt;/strong&gt;. While common in older adults, early-onset cases may develop &lt;strong&gt;t&lt;/strong&gt;hrough different, still unknown mechanisms. This case is forcing researchers to rethink their understanding of how and why Alzheimer’s begins.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Future of Alzheimer’s Research&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experts say this unusual case raises critical scientific questions. If a previously healthy teenager can develop &lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s without a genetic link&lt;/strong&gt;, are there other unknown environmental or biological factors at play?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Neurologists at &lt;strong&gt;Capital Medical University in Beijing&lt;/strong&gt;, who published the case study in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad221065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, emphasized the need for more research on young patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;They believe studying&lt;strong&gt; early-onset cases &lt;/strong&gt;could unlock new insights into the fundamental causes of Alzheimer’s, potentially leading to earlier detection and better treatments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the words of the researchers, “Exploring the mysteries of young people with Alzheimer’s disease may become one of the most challenging scientific questions of the future.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnp00053b5vjwkbbt6k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some people might dread the seemingly insignificant conversation or think it’s not worth their time, while others may delight in the light exchange. In most cases, especially with strangers or acquaintances, small talk is unavoidable as both parties try to find common ground.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnp00063b5v0rhmmbwa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s communication that we use to orient and acquaint ourselves with other people, (and) it’s the gateway to deeper, richer talk,” said Matt Abrahams, a lecturer in organizational behavior at Stanford Graduate School of Business. “Chances are, somebody in your friendship group, if not more, you met through a small talk situation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnp00073b5ved3uthme@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For people without much practice in small talk, the challenge may feel daunting. But there are ways to get better at this form of communication. And it’s worthwhile to try, as the exchanges can positively affect a person’s overall well-being, Abrahams said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnp00083b5vuw3hwelb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s what experts want people to know about the benefits of small talk.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnp00093b5vacby5q7h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People facing the prospect of small talk may put too much pressure on themselves to perform well when meeting someone for the first time. They also may worry about the daunting act of speaking spontaneously, which requires thinking on the spot and responding fast to keep the conversation going, said Abrahams, who hosts the podcast “&lt;a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/business-podcasts/think-fast-talk-smart-podcast" target="_blank"&gt;Think Fast, Talk Smart&lt;/a&gt;,” to share tips for strategic communication.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnp000a3b5vvp39ypt8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So why should you do it? Whether or not you seek out small talk or avoid it at all costs, research has shown that light conversations with people you don’t know well can have beneficial effects on health and well-being, such as &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24769739/" target="_blank"&gt;boosting your mood&lt;/a&gt; and decreasing your &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-28833-001" target="_blank"&gt;feelings of isolation&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnp000b3b5vpdo1kp6p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “(Small talk) is something that we psychologists think is kind of fundamental. It’s like (how) we need food, we need water — we need to feel like we belong and that we matter to other people,” said Dr. Gillian Sandstrom, an associate professor in the psychology of kindness at the UK’s University of Sussex who has researched the effects of minimal social interactions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnp000c3b5vd3tep3sv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Then-US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy declared &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/18/health/loneliness-community-wellness/index.html"&gt;loneliness&lt;/a&gt; an epidemic in the United States in 2023. Daily loneliness affects 1 in 5 adults in the US, the highest &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/651881/daily-loneliness-afflicts-one-five.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;level in two years&lt;/a&gt;, according to Gallup data from October.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnp000d3b5vb3p51kkw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By having a light conversation with an acquaintance or stranger, people can feel more connected with one another and have a stronger sense of community, said Sandstrom, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/27/health/casual-relationships-older-adults-khn-wellness-partner/index.html"&gt;whose research has shown&lt;/a&gt; that those who have more casual daily interactions, such as talking to a neighbor or a barista at a coffee shop, feel a greater sense of belonging.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnp000e3b5vnpe0is02@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Talking to strangers can feel scary because we don’t know what’s going to happen, but also that’s kind of exciting,” Sandstrom said. “It’s fun and it’s nice to have some unexpected thing happen, where we learn something new or see a new perspective.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnp000f3b5v3w403ffe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In some scenarios, such as an upcoming work or networking event, people can prepare ahead of time for the expected spontaneous conversations, said &lt;a href="https://www.sunitasah.com/about-sunita" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Sunita Sah&lt;/a&gt;, an organizational psychologist and professor of management and organizations at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Researching people ahead of time who you know will be at an event and planning questions to ask can help to alleviate nerves, Sah said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnp000g3b5vzrserbux@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In more spontaneous moments, there are tricks to making good conversation. The easiest method is to make an observation about your shared surroundings, which is why people often talk about the weather, or to ask people general questions to learn more about them, Sah said. (That’s why people often ask if you did anything interesting over the weekend or if you have any vacation plans.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnp000h3b5vbpxjmtwj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This kind of conversation isn’t a tennis match, where one needs to get the ball back to the other side of the court as fast as possible. Abrahams said he likes to think of this exchange more as a game of hacky sack — in which the goal is to be collaborative to keep the sack in the air.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnq000i3b5v7ynoh70r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You have to coordinate with the other person, so I want to set you up, so then you can set me back up. It’s about being &lt;a href="https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/dont-sweat-small-stuff-how-excel-small-talk-even-enjoy-it" target="_blank"&gt;interested, not interesting&lt;/a&gt;, and that mindset shift is important,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnq000j3b5vbvng9e6v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sometimes slowing down and taking a beat before responding can reduce rambling and give more clarity and structure to an answer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnq000k3b5vq68l73wd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “People will feel in small talk and other spontaneous speaking situations that they have to respond immediately, (but) you can say, ‘Give me a second to think about that.’ Or you can ask a clarifying question that gives yourself time to think,” Abrahams added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnq000l3b5viq18pc62@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Like anything, small talk gets better with practice, Sandstrom said. If someone goes a long time without socializing in casual settings, small talk might seem scarier than it is.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnq000m3b5vni5sj5py@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103122000750" target="_blank"&gt;In her research&lt;/a&gt;, Sandstrom found that the more people engage in small talk, the more confident they become in their social skills and the less worried they are about rejection, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnq000n3b5vd2kpr20l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At the end of the day, small talk is meant to be lighthearted and enjoyable, and a little humor and compassion go a long way, Sah said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnq000o3b5vesg9rjjk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I personally really love small talk. I think it gives you lovely interactions with people throughout the day that you probably don’t want to go deeper with,” Sah said. “It really does build rapport and trust and some level of friendliness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ntbxnq000p3b5vd3ajrhny@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In today’s age where everybody can just revert to their phones or go days without speaking to someone, I think that small talk (helps) take away the loneliness aspect.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

One reason is that cancer “feels like it’s something we can’t do anything about — once you get it, you die,” says Ropeik. “But that’s no longer anywhere near medically true.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="md:hidden"&gt;&lt;div class="mx-auto mb-5 flex flex-col overflow-hidden rounded-xl pb-5 shadow-[0_0_1px_rgba(200,160,251,.63),0_2px_6px_1px_#F3E6FE]"&gt;&lt;h3 class="m-auto block px-4 pb-4 pt-2 text-lg font-bold leading-6"&gt;Trusted news and daily delights, right in your inbox&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="m-auto px-4 pb-4 text-sm font-normal"&gt;See for yourself — The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The fact that even experts don’t know exactly why colorectal cancer cases are rising among young people further spurs the feeling of uncertainty. And what theories scientists have to explain the phenomenon — such as rising rates of obesity and diets high in ultra-processed foods — only make people feel less in control. “People in their early 40s or 30s who used to have a lot of Cheez-Wiz or Top Ramen in college — those are refined and ultraprocessed, they can’t do anything about that now,” says Cassiday. For young adults looking back on their past choices and youthful indiscretions, it may feel like the damage that puts them at risk for colorectal cancer has already been done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That concern can lead people to assume the worst, or seek out testing that may be unnecessary&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;“It’s a response you have, to try to play it safe rather than sorry,” says Cassiday. “We’re hardwired to feel whatever is scariest first,” to try to prepare for whatever horror our imaginations have cooked up, she adds. “But there’s no real way to be prepared for a horrible diagnosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And worry is only further fueled by stark, and not always well-contextualized warnings that colorectal cancer is on the rise. “The flashy or frightening headline is what gets attention,” says Cassiday. And when most of us see a statistic — like colorectal cancer rates doubling since the 1990s — we don’t necessarily realize that the figure applies to the population, not our personal risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Most cancers can cause a wide array of subtle symptoms, many of which are experienced by healthy people too, says Cassiday. That’s especially true for symptoms of colorectal cancer, such as diarrhea, changes to stool color or consistency and stomach upset. &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:18;pos:1" class="link " href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4108-diarrhea" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Diarrhea;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:18;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Diarrhea&lt;/a&gt; affects everyone, with most adults experiencing at least one bout a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="how-to-combat-colorectal-cancer-phobia--and-what-not-to-do"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to combat colorectal cancer phobia — and what not to do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO: Put the numbers into perspective.&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, the rate of colorectal cancer has risen dramatically among young adults. But it’s risen from an extremely small share of all cases to a small share of cases. In 2023, adults under 50 accounted for 13% of colorectal cancer cases and fewer than one in 10 deaths from colorectal cancer, according to the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:19;pos:1" class="link " href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21772#:~:text=Estimated%20cases%20and%20deaths%20in,age%2C%202023%2C%20United%20States.&amp;amp;text=Note:%20Estimates%20are%20rounded%20to,and%20exclude%20in%20situ%20carcinoma.&amp;amp;text=Colon%20and%20rectal%20cancer%20deaths,the%20large%20rate%20of%20misclassification." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Cancer Society’s (ACS) estimates;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:19;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;American Cancer Society’s (ACS) estimates&lt;/a&gt;. About 13 out of every 100,0000 young adults in the U.S. are diagnosed with the disease. That’s the equivalent of 13 people in all of Burbank, Calif.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON’T: Fall prey to ‘reassurance thinking.’ &lt;/strong&gt;In the throes of anxiety, it’s common for people to look for examples of others who feel like they do, online or among their friends, says Cassiday. It’s one of the “worst things you can do,” she says. “You’re granting yourself the right to practice medicine without a license.” Instead, seek reliable information from organizations like the ACS, the National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or reputable health care providers. And ask yourself “the other what-ifs: What if I’m in great health? What if nothing’s changed for me,” says Cassiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO: Get comfortable with uncertainty. &lt;/strong&gt;“The normal state for all human beings is not to know how we will die,” Cassiday says. “The ultimate answer to that uncertainty is to live well now.” She adds that doing some “exposure practice” and allowing yourself to think about the scary thoughts briefly without running away or letting them consume you can help you adjust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DON’T: Run to the doctor. &lt;/strong&gt;Screening can, and does, save lives. But it can hurt, too, says Ropeik. For one, it gets expensive, especially because your insurance is unlikely to cover the tests or procedures if you’re under the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:20;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/colorectal-cancer-screening" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:recommended;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:20;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; age to start screening (45) and are otherwise at normal risk. Ropkeik warns that over-screening can also lead to even more anxiety-inducing false positives and even to injuries (there’s technically a &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:21;pos:1" class="link " href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2821994/#:~:text=Complications%20during%20colonoscopy,transfusion%20or%20additional%20invasive%20procedures." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:higher rate of colonoscopy complications;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:21;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;higher rate of colonoscopy complications&lt;/a&gt; than there is of colorectal cancer — though those too are more common among older people).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DO: Watch for real signs. &lt;/strong&gt;All that said — if you &lt;em&gt;do &lt;/em&gt;have new symptoms, such as diarrhea or blood in your stool, that don’t get better over time, you should see your health care provider.

It is a scary feeling, and I was freaked out. Fortunately, my wife had an albuterol inhaler handy that she uses for asthma. That seemed to solve the problem. Is there anything else I could use if this happens again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XDVQIPPKQVGO7IZOGQSHKYIUSM"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A.&lt;/b&gt; Albuterol is considered a “rescue inhaler” for people with asthma.

A recent study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/systems-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2024.1489919/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; explored how chewing different materials affects the brain and found that chewing on wood, compared to chewing gum, led to a significant increase in a brain antioxidant called glutathione.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has suggested that the act of chewing can influence brain activity and blood flow. This is important because the brain requires a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients to function properly, and blood flow is the delivery system for these essential resources. Some studies have even shown that people with chewing difficulties tend to experience poorer cognitive abilities. However, exactly what metabolic changes occur in the brain when chewing improves blood flow has remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One area of interest is oxidative stress in the brain. Oxidative stress is essentially damage to brain cells caused by harmful molecules called reactive oxygen species. This kind of damage is thought to play a significant role in the decline of brain function as we age. The brain is especially vulnerable to oxidative stress because it uses a lot of oxygen and contains fats that are easily damaged. To protect itself, the brain uses antioxidants, and one of the most important is glutathione.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glutathione acts like a bodyguard for brain cells, neutralizing harmful reactive oxygen species. Researchers in this study were curious if chewing, and specifically chewing materials of different hardness, could influence the levels of this protective antioxidant, glutathione, in the brain. They also wanted to see if any changes in glutathione were related to changes in thinking skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate these questions, the researchers recruited 52 healthy university students in South Korea. They divided the students into two groups: one group would chew gum, and the other group would chew small wooden sticks, similar to popsicle sticks. The researchers made sure the groups were similar in age, gender, and education level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before the chewing began, and again after five minutes of chewing, the researchers used a special brain scanning technique called Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy to measure the levels of glutathione in a specific area of the brain called the anterior cingulate cortex. This brain region is known to be important for cognitive control and thinking processes. Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy is a non-invasive method that allows scientists to measure the concentration of different chemicals in the brain. The specific technique they used, called MEGA-PRESS, is particularly good at measuring glutathione.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the chewing task, participants were positioned comfortably and instructed to chew for five minutes. To keep the chewing consistent, they were asked to chew on the right side of their mouth at a rate of once per second, alternating between 30 seconds of chewing and 30 seconds of rest. One group chewed paraffin wax gum, which is a standard type of chewing gum used in research. The other group chewed on wooden tongue depressors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both before and after the chewing session, all participants also completed a cognitive test called the Korean Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological State. This test is designed to quickly assess different aspects of thinking skills, including memory, attention, language, and visual-spatial abilities. This allowed the researchers to see if there was any change in cognitive function related to the chewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After analyzing the data, the researchers found some interesting results. First, they looked at the glutathione levels in the anterior cingulate cortex before and after chewing. In the group that chewed wood, they observed a significant increase in glutathione levels after chewing compared to before. This means that chewing wood seemed to boost the amount of this important antioxidant in that brain region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in the gum-chewing group, there was no significant change in glutathione levels after chewing. While there wasn’t a statistically significant difference in the change in glutathione levels between the gum and wood groups directly, the trend was clearly towards a greater increase in the wood-chewing group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the researchers examined the relationship between changes in glutathione levels and performance on the cognitive tests. They found that in the wood-chewing group, the increase in glutathione levels was positively related to scores on immediate memory and story memory tests. This means that participants who showed a larger increase in glutathione after chewing wood also tended to perform better on memory tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, this relationship was not found in the gum-chewing group. There was no link between changes in glutathione and memory performance for those who chewed gum. In essence, chewing wood seemed to both increase brain antioxidant levels and improve certain aspects of memory, and these two changes appeared to be connected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the study, like all research, has some limitations to consider. Firstly, the participants were all young, healthy university students in their twenties. It’s not clear if these findings would be the same in older adults or in people with health conditions. Future studies should include a wider range of ages to see if the effects of chewing on glutathione and cognition are consistent across the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the study focused on just one specific brain region, the anterior cingulate cortex. While this region is important for thinking, it would be beneficial to investigate other brain areas to get a more complete picture of how chewing affects the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, the chewing period was relatively short, only five minutes. It’s possible that longer chewing durations, or different patterns of chewing, could have different effects. Also, while the study compared gum and wood, these materials differ in more ways than just hardness. Texture and other properties could also play a role. Future research could explore a wider variety of chewing materials and try to objectively measure the hardness of what people are chewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In summary, this study yielded two major findings. Firstly, the wood-chewing group experienced stimulated of brain [glutathione (GSH)] synthesis, leading to increased GSH levels in the brain,” the researchers concluded. “Secondly, correlation analysis indicated that the higher GSH levels in the wood-chewing group were associated with improved scores in cognitive measures. Since there are currently no drugs or established practices for boosting brain GSH levels, our findings suggest that chewing moderately hard material could serve as an effective practice for increasing GSH levels in the brain. Based on these results, consuming harder foods might prove more effective in enhancing brain antioxidant defenses through elevated GSH levels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnsys.2024.1489919" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Effect of Chewing Hard Material on Boosting Brain Antioxidant Levels and Enhancing Cognitive Function&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Seungho Kim, Ji-Hye Kim, Hansol Lee, Sung Ho Jang, Ralph Noeske, Changho Choi, Yongmin Chang, and Youn-Hee Choi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 11:19:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxNV2Y3Z29Gd3kxR3RiRzktVU5MT2hXUko4aE01OU5mWlVuQjZMbkdJanVCMEtRQjBVcjZlWkx0WFE5YTJQV0JzRnJzTmVCUzhyUXJxZVBIOVVYNDRlOUpaU2taSEM4X2VuNGpIazd3OEVndkxCZEFJZjdTSzRHaVdGSFJMUktsT2gteFdtSlpjVWE5RmM</guid></item><item><title>‘Short sighted’: What canceled FDA meetings and WHO withdrawal mean for fall flu vaccines - The Boston Globe</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxNajhqMXBhOFowMlpRQ3NveE9sOFgtU1dZSzVpZEJaM2Ixd1IxSE4yYjVBR1lvcXdJNElnRUtjRnZvZW91LTl3UDYwaXVsOWJEcFFIUEZQOUVoTXBoeEFZQTI0UE9WcTdMOWpVTU1PYzF5SUVBc1VXNC0zYXdHRHd5djRqOA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content

That includes hearing presentations from the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Department of Defense on flu strains circulating throughout the world, said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a voting member of the VRBPAC. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Typically, the vaccine is trivalent, meaning it targets two A type strains and one B strain. Vaccine composition usually changes each year, Offit said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;During the meeting, experts examine data from Southern Hemisphere countries that have earlier winters to predict which strains will be dominant in the US. Panelists also perform a “post mortem” on the previous year’s flu season and how well scientists predicted which strains to target, Offit said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“There’s vigorous debate and sometimes disagreement because that’s the way it should work,” he added. “This is a group of experts in the field who are independent of the government and independent of the pharmaceutical industry.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The committee meets early in the year because it usually &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/in-depth/flu-shots/art-20048000" target="_blank"&gt;takes about six months&lt;/a&gt; for pharmaceutical companies to produce the vaccine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“If you want a vaccine available for the fall, the strains included have to be decided by springtime,” said Dr. Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, adding that the meeting’s cancellation is a “clear departure from prior practice.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/advisory-committees/vaccines-and-related-biological-products-advisory-committee/charter-vaccines-and-related-biological-products-advisory-committee" target="_blank"&gt;VRBPAC&lt;/a&gt; usually follows guidelines set out by the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/global-influenza-programme/vaccines#:~:text=The%20World%20Health%20Organization%20(WHO,northern%20and%20southern%20hemispheres%2C%20respectively." target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization in February&lt;/a&gt; about which viruses to target. But on his first day in office, Trump signed an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/withdrawing-the-united-states-from-the-worldhealth-organization/" target="_blank"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; withdrawing the US from WHO. Offit said this is unlikely to impact the decisions the FDA makes about the flu vaccine. because experts from both organizations usually come to similar conclusions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It’s just disappointing to see that the tone is one of rejection of federal expertise regarding public health,” Offit said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Once the FDA decides which strains to target, manufacturers begin the process of including the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccine-process/index.html#:~:text=The%20most%20common,spray%20flu%20vaccine%22)." target="_blank"&gt;killed or weakened&lt;/a&gt; viruses in their vaccines, which are then formulated into standard doses for distribution.

&lt;p&gt;The Conversation asked &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Pu3L9HkAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;epidemiologist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://ph.ucla.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/annette-regan"&gt;Annette Regan&lt;/a&gt; to explain why this flu season is different from last year's and what people can do to help reduce the spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How do flu cases and hospitalizations this year compare with previous years?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning in late January and extending through February 2025, flu hospitalizations &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-07.html"&gt;have been higher&lt;/a&gt; than any other week &lt;a href="https://gis.cdc.gov/GRASP/Fluview/FluHospRates.html"&gt;since before 2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most flu cases appear to be from  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-influenza" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="103478" data-postid="153901" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt; A strains, with a split between influenza A/H3N2 and influenza A/H1N1. These are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses-types.html"&gt;two different subtypes&lt;/a&gt; of the influenza A  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="153901" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe that historically seasons that are predominated by influenza A/H3N2 infections &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2023.06.024"&gt;tend to be more severe&lt;/a&gt;, but infections from influenza A/H1N1 &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2666-5247(23)00187-8"&gt;can still be very severe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year's season is also peaking "late" compared with the past three flu seasons, which peaked in early or late December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there have been a number of deaths from flu too this season. Since Jan. 1, 2025, alone, over &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-06.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_6-mortality-surveillance"&gt;4,000 people, including 68 children, have died&lt;/a&gt; from flu. While the number of deaths do not mark a record number, it shows that flu can be a serious illness, even in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fH6v_uQYPs4?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Unless directed otherwise, everyone ages 6 months and older should get a flu shot.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why are flu cases so high this year?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of factors behind any severe season, including poor community protection from low immunization rates and low natural immunity, virus characteristics, vaccine effectiveness and increased human contact via travel, office work or schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, flu vaccination rates have declined since the COVID-19 pandemic. At the end of the 2023-24 flu season, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/adult-vaccinations-administered.html"&gt;9.2 million fewer doses&lt;/a&gt; were administered in pharmacies and doctors' offices compared with an average year before the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, since 2022, fewer and fewer doses of flu vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccine-doses-distributed.html"&gt;have been distributed&lt;/a&gt; by private manufacturers. Flu vaccination rates for adults have historically been in the 30% to 60% range, &lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/browse-objectives/vaccination/increase-proportion-people-who-get-flu-vaccine-every-year-iid-09"&gt;much lower than the recommended 70%&lt;/a&gt;. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, flu vaccination rates were increasing by &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/adultvaxview/publications-resources/vaccination-coverage-adults-2019-2020.html"&gt;around 1% to 2% every year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flu vaccination rates began dropping after the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in higher-risk groups. Flu vaccination &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/children-vaccination-coverage.html"&gt;in children has dropped&lt;/a&gt; from 59% in 2019-20 to 46% in 2024-25. In adults 65 years and older, the group with the greatest risk of hospitalization and death, flu vaccination rates dropped &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/adults-65-years-and-older.html"&gt;from 52% in 2019-20 to 43% in 2024-25&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower vaccination rates mean a greater portion of the population is not protected by vaccines. Data shows that vaccination &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2017.1321722"&gt;reduces the risk of flu hospitalization&lt;/a&gt;. Even if a vaccinated person gets infected, they may be &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(22)00493-5"&gt;less likely to experience severe illness&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, low vaccination rates could contribute to higher flu severity this season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, low vaccination rates are probably not the only reason for the high rates of flu this season. In previous severe seasons, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2666-5247(24)00067-3"&gt;genetic changes to the viruses&lt;/a&gt; have made them better at infecting people and more likely to cause severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effectiveness of annual flu vaccines varies depending on how well the vaccine matches the circulating virus. The effectiveness of vaccines &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/coverage-by-season/2023-2024.html"&gt;ranges from 19% to 60%&lt;/a&gt; in any given season. In the 2023-24 flu season, the vaccine was 42% effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, early 2024-25 data from the U.S. shows that the vaccine was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a2.htm?s_cid=mm7406a2_e&amp;amp;ACSTrackingID=USCDC_921-DM145368&amp;amp;ACSTrackingLabel=This%20Week%20in%20MMWR%3A%20Vol.%2074%2C%20February%2027%2C%202025&amp;amp;deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM145368"&gt;41% to 55% effective&lt;/a&gt; against flu hospitalizations in adults and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7406a2.htm?s_cid=mm7406a2_e&amp;amp;ACSTrackingID=USCDC_921-DM145368&amp;amp;ACSTrackingLabel=This%20Week%20in%20MMWR%3A%20Vol.%2074%2C%20February%2027%2C%202025&amp;amp;deliveryName=USCDC_921-DM145368"&gt;63% to 78% effective&lt;/a&gt; against flu hospitalizations in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8DhgzpELrPI?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Something as simple as regular handwashing could keep you from getting the flu.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How do seasonal flu symptoms differ from COVID-19 and other illnesses?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's important to remember that people often incorrectly refer to "the flu" when they have a common cold. Flu is caused only by the influenza virus, which tends to be &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/coldflu.html"&gt;more severe than common colds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/education/cold-or-flu"&gt;more commonly causes a fever&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the signs and symptoms for flu, COVID-19 and other respiratory  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="153901" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/flu-vs-covid19.html"&gt;are the same&lt;/a&gt; and can range from mild coldlike symptoms to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pneumonia" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73057" data-postid="153901" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pneumonia&lt;/a&gt; and respiratory distress. Common flu symptoms are  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fever" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73066" data-postid="153901" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fever&lt;/a&gt;, cough and fatigue, and may also include shortness of breath, a sore throat, nasal congestion, muscle aches and headache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some symptoms, such as changes in or loss of taste and smell, are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9061753"&gt;more common for COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;. For both COVID-19 and flu, the symptoms do not start until about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/flu-vs-covid19.html"&gt;one to four days after infection&lt;/a&gt;, and symptoms seem to last longer for COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to know what virus is causing an infection is to test. This can be done using a rapid test, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/home-otc-covid-19-diagnostic-tests"&gt;some of which now test for flu and COVID-19 together&lt;/a&gt;, or by seeing a doctor and getting tested using a nasal swab. There are prescription antiviral medications available to treat flu and COVID-19, but they need to be taken near the time that symptoms start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people are at &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/index.htm"&gt;high risk of severe flu&lt;/a&gt; and COVID-19, such as those who are immunosuppressed, have  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="153901" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; or have chronic heart or lung conditions. In these cases, it is important to seek early care and treatment from a health care professional. Some doctors will also prescribe via telehealth calls, which can help reduce the strain on doctors' offices, urgent care centers and emergency rooms when infection rates are high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What can people do now to help steer clear of the flu?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways people can reduce their risk of getting or spreading flu. Since the flu season is still underway, it's not too late to get a flu vaccine. Even in seasons when the vaccine's effectiveness is low, it is likely to offer better protection compared with remaining unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/clean-hands/about/index.html"&gt;Handwashing&lt;/a&gt; and disinfecting high-traffic surfaces can help reduce contact with the flu virus. Taking efforts to avoid contact with sick people can also help, including wearing a mask when in health care facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, remember to take care of yourself. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevention/actions-prevent-flu.html"&gt;Exercising, eating healthy and getting sufficient sleep&lt;/a&gt; all help support a healthy immune system, which can help reduce chances of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who have been diagnosed with flu or are experiencing flu-like symptoms should avoid contact with other people, especially in crowded spaces. Covering coughs and sneezes can help reduce the amount of virus that is spread.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/250252/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Currently, the most common viruses in circulation are Influenza A (H1N1) and its subtype H3N2. Several factors contribute to the increase of cases:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seasonal pattern: The monsoon and winter months create helpful circumstances for the virus to grow and spread.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increased travel and gatherings: Following the epidemic, social interactions and travel have increased, making the virus more easily transmitted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many people have weakened immunity as a result of changing weather, COVID-19 problems, and stress-related health difficulties.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Delayed vaccination: Many people are vulnerable because they are unaware of and unable to obtain flu shots.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does Swine Flu spread?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swine flu spreads similarly to regular flu viruses. The primary modes of transmission include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Person-to-person contact: Respiratory droplets from an infected person's cough, sneeze, or speech can transmit the virus.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Touching infected surfaces: The virus can live for hours on surfaces such as handrails, tables, and doorknobs, raising the chance of infection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Close contact with sick people: The danger of contracting the virus is greatly increased when you spend time with someone who displays flu-like symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to prevent Swine Flu?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is no foolproof way to avoid swine flu, following these &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/swine-flu/prevention/index.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;preventive measures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; can significantly reduce the risk:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Frequent handwashing: Wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can also be effective.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear a mask: Especially in crowded places, wearing a mask helps prevent inhaling infected droplets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Boost immunity: Eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and get adequate sleep to strengthen the immune system.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid close contact with infected individuals: If someone around you is showing flu-like symptoms, maintain a safe distance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get vaccinated: The flu vaccine provides protection against influenza viruses, including H1N1.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disinfect surfaces: Regularly clean frequently touched surfaces to prevent viral contamination.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Practice respiratory hygiene: Always cover your mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing and dispose of tissues properly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Are there medications for Swine Flu?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1352045/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;antiviral medications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; like oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) are recommended for treating swine flu. These drugs work best when taken within the first 48 hours of symptom onset, reducing the severity and duration of the illness. However, they should only be taken under medical supervision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Explained: How Zika spreads and what you can do to stay safe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When to seek medical help?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While mild flu symptoms can be treated at home, seek urgent medical attention if you have:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shortness or difficulty breathing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chronic chest discomfort or pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Confusion or dizziness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A high temperature for more than three days.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Severe vomiting and dehydration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 10:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>Your OB-GYN might be feeding you outdated menopause information - Axios</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTFAwSGxLV09ITE1GZTktRU5kUzA5aXVrZVVZWEtxV2VEM3JhT0dsTTdlTDZ2ODJSRXBla1JPWHVBUjFNZEVTRkM1Q3B4MWpRQThOQVZ4eUxFMG5GdGRiekxyMXk4a09hVml3dVM5amd5al94MDdJZVVFSHlSNW5ldw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 10:23:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFAwSGxLV09ITE1GZTktRU5kUzA5aXVrZVVZWEtxV2VEM3JhT0dsTTdlTDZ2ODJSRXBla1JPWHVBUjFNZEVTRkM1Q3B4MWpRQThOQVZ4eUxFMG5GdGRiekxyMXk4a09hVml3dVM5amd5al94MDdJZVVFSHlSNW5ldw</guid></item><item><title>What Hormone Therapy Can Do For Menopause and Long-term Health - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxPcTdQem94ZVByNlctcHdCNmRkNnlvRHpYNUM0T2tiTzk0VHZHRW5oekZZWldIRndDWGM3YWtpUWpkVW16bEQySXZPWXJ2Z3FtdEppei1PNHl3VTNPaUtPQ21UWmttMXNDU19DSkxwUE53MTRuWDBPbFZIUWtlb0J5VVVLOUxxZVJzaTloX2ZVMzVmZ0lkRE5FMg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;At Dr. Monica Christmas’s clinic these days, she sees two kinds of menopausal patients.

They also looked at markers of biological aging in a smaller subset of the study group (over 45,000 people). Their analysis included comparisons of genetic risk factors for disease as well as what some scientists have termed the “exposome.” Our DNA makes up our genome, whereas the exposome is made up of all the exposures we encounter throughout life.

Smoking, socioeconomic status — a measure of factors like income, neighborhood, education and occupation — physical activity levels and living conditions had the greatest influence on someone’s biological aging and risk of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some of these factors — such as how much money you make or whether you can afford to own a home in a nice neighborhood — are hard to change. But overall, 23 out of 25 of the environmental variables the researchers looked at are modifiable. And many of them are pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="do-genes-not-matter-when-it-comes-to-longevity"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do genes not matter when it comes to longevity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;No, they definitely do. But to what extent varies a lot depending on the specific genes, the diseases that they put you at risk for and what you do throughout your life. For example, which variants of the &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/genes-known-increase-risk-alzheimer-151136656.html" data-ylk="slk:APOE gene;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:5;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;APOE gene&lt;/a&gt; you carry is highly predictive of your risk for Alzheimer’s disease; the same goes for &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/jenna-wolfe-hysterectomy-brca-gene-232125745.html" data-ylk="slk:BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants and breast cancer;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants and breast cancer&lt;/a&gt;. And these diseases can have a lot to do with your biological aging and life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But even these genes are influenced by your behavior and environment. And, in most cases, our choices and the lives we lead have a huge impact on what those genes will mean for our health. “Someone put a comment on our paper, saying ‘genetics loads the dice, but it’s up to us to play our hand,’” &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/people/austin-argentieri-phd/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Austin Argentieri,;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Austin Argentieri,&lt;/a&gt; a research fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital who led the new study while he was a researcher at Oxford Population Health, tells Yahoo Life. Even if your genetic makeup predisposes you to diseases that could cut your life short, “in most cases, you can mitigate that risk through lifestyle, behavior, or taking different drugs or treatments,” explains Argentieri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="changes-that-can-set-you-up-for-a-longer-life"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changes that can set you up for a longer life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="1-dont-smoke"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Don’t smoke.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;By now, it’s hardly a surprise that &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/smoking-rates-declining-too-lung-120036320.html" data-ylk="slk:smoking;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:8;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;smoking &lt;/a&gt;is bad for you. But, aside from a person’s age, smoking has a greater bearing on longevity and aging than any other factor — genetic or environmental — according to the new study. Second to age, the factor that most influenced mortality risk was “smoking pack years,” meaning the number of packs of cigarettes a person smoked daily, for how many years. And smoking status — whether someone currently, formerly or never smoked — was the fourth-most-influential factor (sex was third; men are more likely to die earlier than women). “If you can do one thing, don’t smoke,” says Argentieri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="2-get-good-sleep"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Get good sleep.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;People who are tired frequently or don’t get very much sleep at night are more likely to both age quickly and die prematurely. &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/how-much-sleep-do-i-need-201727574.html" data-ylk="slk:How much sleep you need;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;How much sleep you need&lt;/a&gt; varies from person to person, but for most adults, you should aim to get seven to nine hours a night. And try to have good “&lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/sleep-hygiene-140453735.html" data-ylk="slk:sleep hygiene;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;sleep hygiene&lt;/a&gt;” by going to bed and waking at consistent times, &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/babies-have-sleep-routines-heres-why-adults-should-too-205345568.html" data-ylk="slk:having a bedtime routine;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;having a bedtime routine&lt;/a&gt;, keeping your room dark and keeping your phone away from your bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="3-get-moving"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Get moving.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After tiredness, physical activity “is close in the running for the top” factor influencing biological aging and risk of death, says Argentieri. That’s in part because many of the chronic conditions that accelerate aging and lead to early death are cardiometabolic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and stroke. Obesity increases risks for these conditions, while exercise, in combination with a healthy diet, can reduce those risks. Diet may have more influence, but “that doesn’t mean that exercise shouldn’t be part of the plan,” &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1" class="link " href="https://gero.usc.edu/faculty/longo/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Valter Longo;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Valter Longo&lt;/a&gt;, a University of Southern California professor of gerontology who studies how nutrition and fasting can influence longevity, tells Yahoo Life. &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/want-to-live-a-longer-healthier-life-new-research-sheds-light-on-the-lifestyle-factors-that-matter-150908451.html" data-ylk="slk:In combination with other habits, exercising;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;In combination with other habits, exercising&lt;/a&gt; can help you live healthier, for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="4-eat-for-longer-living"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.

That may be because many people change their diets to be healthier &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; they have a health problem, such as prediabetes. But Longo’s research suggests that eating a &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:14;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/longevity-diet-researcher-valter-longo-173410025.html" data-ylk="slk:diet;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:14;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt; that consists of lots of plants and fish and little red meat is associated with a longer life.

But, aside from a person’s age, smoking has a greater bearing on longevity and aging than any other factor — genetic or environmental — according to the new study. Second to age, the factor that most influenced mortality risk was “smoking pack years,” meaning the number of packs of cigarettes a person smoked daily, for how many years. And smoking status — whether someone currently, formerly or never smoked — was the fourth-most-influential factor (sex was third; men are more likely to die earlier than women). “If you can do one thing, don’t smoke,” says Argentieri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="2-get-good-sleep"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.

That’s in part because many of the chronic conditions that accelerate aging and lead to early death are cardiometabolic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and stroke. Obesity increases risks for these conditions, while exercise, in combination with a healthy diet, can reduce those risks. Diet may have more influence, but “that doesn’t mean that exercise shouldn’t be part of the plan,” &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1" class="link " href="https://gero.usc.edu/faculty/longo/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Valter Longo;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Valter Longo&lt;/a&gt;, a University of Southern California professor of gerontology who studies how nutrition and fasting can influence longevity, tells Yahoo Life. &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1" class="link  yahoo-link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/want-to-live-a-longer-healthier-life-new-research-sheds-light-on-the-lifestyle-factors-that-matter-150908451.html" data-ylk="slk:In combination with other habits, exercising;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;"&gt;In combination with other habits, exercising&lt;/a&gt; can help you live healthier, for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold" data-jump-link-target="" id="4-eat-for-longer-living"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.

While some &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6853289/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; indicates that it is marginal, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360132306000242" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; from Finland suggests that it might be more significant. Take the office environment, for example. While it's unlikely that there's a temperature which pleases everyone due to our individual thermoregulation, overall the study found that women were often dissatisfied with the room temperature, feeling both uncomfortably colder and hotter than men. Another study of office temperatures in Japan showed a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378778802000129" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;3.1C (37F) difference in neutral temperature&lt;/a&gt; between female and male workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In the home, meanwhile, reaching an optimal core body temperature may not be a "golden ticket" to a perfect sleep, says Bill Wisden, a sleep expert and director of the UK Dementia Research Institute at Imperial College London, "but it would help".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Sleep, he says, is "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0031938406003933" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;temporally related&lt;/a&gt; to the circadian rhythm of core body temperature and skin temperature". In other words, a couple of hours before we go to sleep, our core body temperature begins to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468867319301804" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;decrease&lt;/a&gt; when melatonin, the hormone that regulates the sleep cycle, is produced. Body temperature continues to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/bedroom-environment/best-temperature-for-sleep" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;drop&lt;/a&gt; throughout the night reaching a low point in the early morning before gradually warming up as the morning progresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kv8430.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Elderly people are more vulnerable to temperature changes as they are less able to thermoregulate (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Elderly people are more vulnerable to temperature changes as they are less able to thermoregulate (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;One thing that can help you fall asleep is the "&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1087079218301552?via=ihub" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;hot bath effect&lt;/a&gt;". Wisden says that having a hot bath before bedtime can help induce sleep. "We've done physiological experiments with mice and found that if you warm the skin, that sends signals to the hypothalamus in the base of the brain – and that triggers an induction of sleep and a cooling of the body." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;So, getting under a thick duvet at night can help the body prepare the body for &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468867319301804" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;longer episodes of sleep or deeper sleep.&lt;/a&gt; Snuggling up like this – to warm the skin – is not unique to humans. Wisden adds: "Pets, cats and dogs curl up – and some animals build a nest… that provides a kind of thermal insulation." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But once you're fast asleep, a cool room temperature is ideal: between 16-18C (60-65F). While &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37474050/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;older adults might sleep more comfortably&lt;/a&gt; in a room that's a couple of degrees warmer, being in a room that's too warm can cause &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001393511500033X?via=ihub" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;poor sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;. This can lead to waking up throughout the night, as well as a lack of non-REM sleep – the most &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526132/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;restful&lt;/a&gt; stage of sleep. "Being too hot during sleep is bad. It's exactly like a noise, or a sensation on your skin, or a pain. Being hot while you're asleep stimulates sensory perception and wakes you up," Wisden says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ultimately, while we can be guided by research, it seems it may be impossible to find an optimal temperature that will please everyone.

Dementia UK, a leading charity, notes that FTD, which affects about 5% of all dementia patients, initially bypasses the more recognized symptoms like memory loss and instead may first show up as obsessive or repetitive behaviors, &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/news/health/164821/vitamin-b12-dementia-risk-lower"&gt;particularly in one's diet.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reports from as.com highlight that according to research from the International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA), individuals with FTD might exhibit a range of unusual eating patterns, such as binge eating, fixations on specific foods, or even ingesting inedible items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sciencedaily echoes this, pointing out the complex challenges posed by the abnormal eating behaviors associated with FTD. In some cases, patients become so fixated on certain foods that they reject anything else; for instance, there was a woman who only ate bananas and milk for months, &lt;a data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="/entertainment/celebrity-news/128794/wendy-williams-has-frontotemporal-dementia-what-ftd"&gt;later confirmed to have had FTD through an autopsy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instances of FTD patients snatching food off others' plates or ignoring their dietary needs are not uncommon. "These behaviours can be problematic both physically and socially," comments Marilena Aiello, a SISSA researcher who contributed to a review on the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ovp-primis"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research unearthed striking data: "Several findings reveal that such eating alterations are more common in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) than other types of dementia. Moreover, eating alterations may differ between the two variants of the disease, namely the behavioral variant and semantic dementia (SD)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-ad"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She offered details: "Patients tend to gain weight. Although in some extreme cases they lose weight due to obsessive consumption of a single food."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study sheds light on how frontotemporal dementia affects dietary habits, the precise mechanisms remain uncertain. Aiello has suggested that disruptions in the autonomic nervous system could be instrumental, particularly by affecting the perception of hunger, satiety, and overall appetite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, harm to the hypothalamus might remove inhibitory controls, prompting uninhibited eating behaviors. The hypothalamus plays a pivotal role in the creation of hormones that govern heart rate, body temperature, as well as the sensation of hunger, and the sleep-wake cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, sensory and cognitive challenges, for instance, struggles with recognizing what is edible, could also have an impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the symptoms of FTD?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altered eating patterns might indicate frontotemporal dementia; however, there are additional tell-tale symptoms to consider. Per NHS England, the chief indicators of FTD usually revolve around changes in character and conduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes impulsive or inappropriate actions, a lack of empathy, neglect of personal hygiene and loss of motivation. Language difficulties may also arise, including slow speech or trouble using words correctly or in the proper order within a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People may also struggle with organising and planning tasks and are easily distracted.

I decided to give it a go, forgoing my usual headphones and music for some focus and breathwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do it, all I had to do was synchronize my steps with my breath and be mindful of my body and surroundings while I walked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-i-found"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What I found: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. You have to concentrate&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This may seem obvious to anyone who has ever tried to pat their head and rub their tummy at the same time, but I was surprised at how much focus was required for me to synchronize my breathing with my steps. Because I was concentrating, my mind didn’t wander and I didn’t spend time analyzing my day — a habit that can make me feel stressed or anxious even in lovely weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Mindfulness came naturally &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once my breath and steps were synchronized, I grew aware of my surroundings and how I felt in my body. I was amazed at how the breathwork made me feel, cutting through the noise in my head and reconnecting me with myself. The rhythmic, repetitive nature of syncing my breath and steps felt calming—almost hypnotic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. I was more aware of the beauty around me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without the distraction of my headphones or thoughts, I noticed the beauty of the natural world. I chose a fantastic day to try walking yoga: the sun was shining, the birds were chirping and I could smell spring in the air. When I got back and thought about it, I realized that the weather had been the same the day before. I just hadn’t noticed because I had been so wrapped up in my thoughts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. It slowed down my walking pace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Ys5bdHaDp675H8urbx4zAk" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Ys5bdHaDp675H8urbx4zAk slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I timed my inhale and exhale to coincide with my left foot striking the ground, so I was taking two steps per breath. This was only sustainable if I slowed my walking pace down. I tried other breathing patterns but nothing else worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-start-walking-yoga"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to start walking yoga&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Start small," advises Drozd, "Especially if you're not a daily yogi or walker." She encourages starting with five minutes a day in a place you know well—your session could even form part of a larger walk. You can then gradually increase by five minutes every few days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This will give you time for your muscles to adjust to your new routine," she says. "Keep increasing until you get to 20 minutes a day. If you can't spare 20 minutes every day or want to mix walking yoga sessions into your weekly routine, I would recommend doing 30 minutes, three days a week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular mindful practice for your mind and body can help reduce stress, boost your mood, and improve concentration and body awareness, says Drozd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-person-Ys5bdHaDp675H8urbx4zAk-MyDJbt1rjt5tjKEvYfiK703BiJyE5fIC" class="slice-container person-wrapper person-Ys5bdHaDp675H8urbx4zAk-MyDJbt1rjt5tjKEvYfiK703BiJyE5fIC slice-container-person"&gt;&lt;div class="person person--separator person--strapline"&gt;&lt;span class="person__strapline"&gt;About our expert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="person__heading"&gt;&lt;span class="person__strapline-inline"&gt;About our expert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="person__name-socials"&gt;&lt;span class="person__name"&gt;Sophia Drozd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;nav class="button-social-group person__social-buttons" aria-labelledby="button-social-group- person__social-buttons"&gt;&lt;p id="button-social-group- person__social-buttons"&gt;Social Links Navigation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="button-social   " href="https://www.instagram.com/yogaforpainapp/%20" target="_blank" aria-label="INSTAGRAM"&gt;&lt;span class="button-social__icon"&gt;&lt;svg class="icon_instagram" viewbox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;&lt;circle cx="12" cy="12" fill="#de3073" r="12"&gt;&lt;/circle&gt;&lt;path d="M18.958 9.116a5.121 5.121 0 00-.336-1.708 3.557 3.557 0 00-2.044-2.044 5.12 5.12 0 00-1.694-.322C14.142 5.014 13.89 5 12 5s-2.142.014-2.884.042a5.213 5.213 0 00-1.708.322 3.665 3.665 0 00-2.044 2.044 5.213 5.213 0 00-.322 1.708C5.014 9.858 5 10.1 5 12s.014 2.142.042 2.884a5.12 5.12 0 00.322 1.694 3.44 3.44 0 00.812 1.246 3.4 3.4 0 001.232.8 5.175 5.175 0 001.708.336c.742.028.98.042 2.884.042s2.142-.014 2.884-.042a5.082 5.082 0 001.694-.336 3.456 3.456 0 002.044-2.044 5.006 5.006 0 00.336-1.694C18.986 14.142 19 13.9 19 12s-.014-2.142-.042-2.884zM17.7 14.828a3.946 3.946 0 01-.252 1.3 2.189 2.189 0 01-.518.8 2.165 2.165 0 01-.8.532 4.641 4.641 0 01-1.3.238c-.742.028-.966.042-2.828.042s-2.1-.014-2.828-.042a3.837 3.837 0 01-1.3-.252A2.258 2.258 0 016.54 16.13a3.91 3.91 0 01-.238-1.3c-.028-.742-.042-.966-.042-2.828s.014-2.086.042-2.828a3.787 3.787 0 01.238-1.3A2.445 2.445 0 017.87 6.54a3.856 3.856 0 011.3-.238c.742-.028.952-.042 2.828-.042s2.086.014 2.828.042a3.787 3.787 0 011.3.238 2.445 2.445 0 011.33 1.33 4.641 4.641 0 01.238 1.3c.027.742.042.952.042 2.828s-.011 2.088-.036 2.83zM12 8.4a3.6 3.6 0 103.6 3.6A3.6 3.6 0 0012 8.4zm.181 5.929a2.338 2.338 0 01-.362-4.662 2.43 2.43 0 01.362 0 2.338 2.338 0 010 4.662zm3.557-6.909a.84.84 0 11-.84.84.84.84 0 01.84-.838z" fill="#fff"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a class="button-social   " href="https://www.yogaforpainapp.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="WEBSITE"&gt;&lt;span class="button-social__icon button-social__icon-website"&gt;&lt;svg class="icon-website" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 1000 1000"&gt;&lt;path d="M1000 500A501 501 0 0 0 503 0h-6A501 501 0 0 0 0 500c0 275 223 499 498 500h4a501 501 0 0 0 498-500zM529 936V765h133c-31 90-79 154-133 171zM337 765h134v171c-54-17-101-81-134-171zM61 539h176a899 899 0 0 0 22 167H110a439 439 0 0 1-49-166zM471 64v191H331c31-101 82-173 140-191zm199 191H529V64c58 18 109 90 140 191zm270 226H763c-1-59-7-115-18-167h155a438 438 0 0 1 40 167zm-235 0H529V314h156a857 857 0 0 1 19 167zM471 314v167H296a859 859 0 0 1 19-167h156zM237 481H60a438 438 0 0 1 41-167h154a921 921 0 0 0-18 167zm59 58h175v167H320a837 837 0 0 1-24-166zm233 167V539h175a831 831 0 0 1-24 167H529zm234-166h176a436 436 0 0 1-49 166H741a893 893 0 0 0 22-166zm104-285H731c-20-68-47-126-81-169a443 443 0 0 1 217 169zM350 86c-33 43-61 101-81 169H133A443 443 0 0 1 350 86zM148 765h127c20 59 45 110 75 150a442 442 0 0 1-202-150zm502 150c30-39 56-91 75-150h127a442 442 0 0 1-202 150z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/nav&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="person__bio"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophia Drozd is the owner and founder of &lt;a href="https://www.yogaforpainapp.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Yoga for Pain&lt;/a&gt;  (Y4P), and is a qualified yoga teacher, lifelong practitioner and chronic pain warrior.

sees tired parents giving their little ones a spoonful of butter before putting them down for the night - with some claiming it helps their tots sleep all the way through until morning.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, despite being hailed by some as a genius parenting hack, experts have warned it's not likely to actually make a difference - and can do more harm than good in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The trend, which first took hold in the US, saw mothers giving their babies a small square or spoonful of butter, often the Irish Kerrygold, before claiming they had managed to enjoy a full eight hours of sleep as their toddler slept through the night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now the trend has spread to the UK and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new_zealand/index.html" id="mol-f4d68940-eed5-11ef-8723-ad50ed56589d"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; with parents desperate for some shut-eye trying it on their own children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One mother has posted several clips on her social media account which show her trying the trend on her tot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Millie (@millieellis) has been documenting her attempts to settle her baby with the technique with her followers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one video she told people: 'So we are going to try the butter trend where you give your baby a spoonful of butter and apparently it works magic and they sleep all night long.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Parents have been feeding their babies butter just before bed in a bid to get their children to sleep through the night, hopping on a viral TikTok trend&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She then filmed herself giving a little spoon of Lurpak to her daughter Ivy, who at first was hesitant but soon swallowed the whole spoonful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After her mouthful of butter, Ivy slept soundly all evening, her mother claims. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Millie has followed up on her first video and posted other people documenting her trying this new trend. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Evaluating the use of butter to send daughter Ivy off to sleep, Millie said she experienced longer between waking up periods but added she wasn't sure if that was the butter or because Ivy was overtired that day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Paige Balloch (@baigepalloch), a mother from New Zealand, also tried the trend explaining that her 15-month-old had never slept through the night and she was willing to try anything. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking to the camera she said: 'We're trying the butter before bed to see if it helps her sleep longer, because what do I have to lose?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exhausted mother then called over her toddler and fed her a spoonful of butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in a follow-up video, Paige revealed it hadn't worked for her little Margot who woke up three times in the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;One mother Millie has posted several videos on her social media account following her trying this trend on her daughter Ivy with mixed success&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the trick takes hold around the world, experts have warned that the viral trick is fruitless and won't help babies sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hannah Love, a nutritional therapist and TikToker, took to the social media platform to debunk the trend, telling her followers it was a waste of time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I know the nutritional benefits of fats and they can slow down digestion, they're going to regulate blood sugar levels, they're going to regulate hormones, they can even reduce inflammation so there's lots of things that fats are very beneficial for to help with sleep which is probably where this has come from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But is butter the best thing for this? No, absolutely not. There are so many more beneficial fats that you could use to benefit your baby's diet.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Charlotte Stirling-Reed, a leading baby nutritionist, told the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/sleep-butter-tiktok-trend-social-media-b2698194.html"&gt;Independent &lt;/a&gt;that that social media platforms are 'rife with misinformation' and that butter is not recommended to help babies sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added that in fact it can present a danger because the texture of the butter could pose a chocking hazard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Incorporating butter into cooking or spreading a thin layer on toast is perfectly fine. However, offering large chunks of butter directly from a spoon is not advisable.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS advises that it is perfectly normal for babies to wake up in the night, telling parents: 'Newborn babies invariably wake up repeatedly in the night for the first few months, and disturbed nights can be very hard to cope with.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Paige Balloch, a New Zealand mum also tired the trend, explaining that her 15-month-old had never slept through the night and she was willing to try anything&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;But experts have warned that the viral trick is a pointless task and won't help babies sleep and could even pose a danger to babies' health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To counteract this, it recommends starting a night time routine which can include having a bath, changing into night clothes reading a bedtime story or singing a lullaby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also reassured parents that different babies have different sleep patterns and it was unwise to compare them with others and instead advised trying to sleep when your baby sleeps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The NHS has also broken down different sleeping patterns for different babies at different stages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It advised that newborns need the most amount of sleep and are often asleep more than they're awake, averaging 18 hours a day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Babies often wake up in the night for feeding or because they need their nappy changing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While babies aged six months to a year old may be able to sleep for longer periods of time but can wake up due to teething or hunger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Two-year-olds will often need to sleep for between 12 to 15 hours a day, including naps while children over the age of three can often get through the day without a nap.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 08:07:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxQdTV4dHNUX0h3MDZSWV84bWdMYmtMRlhzSnV3QTlVOTlUci1NdE1qLXFxZ3VHQkFWMlZybjlUOFRNa1hmd1pScV92a29MMWxzVTQ2M0p2Smg2aXFjOXNxai1PUFJLVlJqYTJxZjg1emxMWWM1ek84aFYwUkg4bXFlYjQxY1QzNzZrZFdQcldLTdIBlAFBVV95cUxOYmF1WGR1Zk05Ni1DdUhkaHBVdTBmcFExcmtJZEJhd09NVTVjWXlmQTNEQW1JYjhqcEdDQWw1dkIxT2JablRoOEpXU29VaHpjS0ZBeUJaemozbzZQdDR5NWF4eTl0bHFfUTdoN2FHOE9VOS1wdm9Pb2pBSFNFTWE5aU5POXE2UHp6MGppeU5Tb3BWSVdn</guid></item><item><title>Prostate cancer test 'could save lives and embarrassment' - BBC.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTFBPZU9zZ295THkwN3JfV3NjZHg3X2hFT1czMW9kVlFPSW5KSFVkT0hrSC1fdkplT1dqMWIxZHlaTzZ1M3Z3RlNUQlVLQy1JSEswNUlCSmI1QUdXUdIBX0FVX3lxTE5nSUM2dG9oR1VONEFTanhSNVA2dUNtR0FzMFpSM0JRbXJ3TWNpaHFMWWRUdWxJNjk0N056QVpLMU1TRk5fdFdoM3pETHAyeHJaeVRVVWRLMjZJLVY5b2pj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 itISwu"&gt;Prostate test could 'save lives and embarrassment'&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 ejjhCR"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/326e/live/b1267f30-f771-11ef-841c-1f98008bd439.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/326e/live/b1267f30-f771-11ef-841c-1f98008bd439.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/326e/live/b1267f30-f771-11ef-841c-1f98008bd439.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/326e/live/b1267f30-f771-11ef-841c-1f98008bd439.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/326e/live/b1267f30-f771-11ef-841c-1f98008bd439.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/326e/live/b1267f30-f771-11ef-841c-1f98008bd439.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/326e/live/b1267f30-f771-11ef-841c-1f98008bd439.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/326e/live/b1267f30-f771-11ef-841c-1f98008bd439.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="BBC Chris Jones.

important decisions" in his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Like many men, I had no symptoms and wouldn't have thought to get tested," Mr Lewis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p

&lt;p&gt;An incurable infectious brain disease that’s deadly to deer, elk and moose continues to stalk the land. By 2015, it had expanded to 23 states and two Canadian province since it was first identified in a Colorado captive mule deer research center in 1967.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, with Washington state’s first case of chronic wasting disease confirmed in an adult female white-tailed deer that was found dead north of Spokane, the disease, CWD, has been identified in 35 states and 6 Canadian provinces.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other recent news, an Indiana county is reporting its first case of chronic wasting disease (CWD), less than a year after the state’s first detection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A 2.5-year-old white-tailed buck in Posey County tested positive after being harvested by a hunter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also concerning is that just several weeks ago, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department announced its second and third cases of CWD had been discovered on an elk feedground — both detected in cow carcasses at the Dell Creek Feedground in the Bondurant area. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CWD travels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a disease doesn’t stay put. It has been found in South Korea; in free-ranging reindeer, moose and red deer in Norway; in free-ranging moose in Finland; and in free-ranging moose Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Caused by malformed proteins called prions, it can be confirmed through testing of lymph nodes or brain tissue, at the base of the skull. The lymph nodes of the deer that tested positive in Eastern Washington in July were submitted to the Washington Animal Disease Laboratory in Pullman at Washington State University.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Much smaller than bacteria, prions are single proteins that cannot be destroyed by typical “kill strategies” such as extreme heat or ultraviolet light.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is no vaccine or cure for this disease. It is spread through urine, feces, saliva, blood, semen, deer parts, and especially via live deer. Not only that, plants and roots can bind, uptake and transport infectious prions. And plants infected with the prions were able to transmit the disease when animals were fed the contaminated plants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a disease that has baffled scientists for decades. Where did it come from, and why is it spreading across the landscape?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“”Our biggest challenge is to try to minimize its spread.” said Melia T. Devivo, the Washington State Fish and Wildlife Department’s lead for its CWD program,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you know if an animal has CWD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Drastic weight loss, stumbling and lack of coordination, drooling, excessive thirst or urination, drooping ears and lack of fear of people are signs that an animal is infected with CWD. No wonder that some people refer to the infected animals as “zombie deer.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But Devivo said that because it takes so long — sometimes several years — for the disease to become apparent in an animal, some animals with CWD look healthy. It’s a year-round disease — not seasonal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because CWD moves slowly through a population, and because it kills individual deer slowly, its impact is not dramatic or rapid, which is why some hunters believe CWD is not a serious problem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, CWD will gradually grow in prevalence if it is not actively managed, and it will eventually reduce populations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“CWD is the biggest threat to the future of deer hunting,” says the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership &lt;a href="https://www.trcp.org/chronic-wasting-disease/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAADq_fn0JJJB1eul-lmXJQWXTk1JDu&amp;amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9vbQ0PbfiwMVm9bCBB0-1jFPEAAYASAAEgLRN_D_BwE)"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt;  Go to the website to watch how fast the disease has spread across the United States since 1968.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where is it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/distribution-chronic-wasting-disease-north-america-0)"&gt;Go here&lt;/a&gt; to see the regions in the U.S. where CWD has been confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Deer and other cervids — members of the deer family — killed in those regions need to be tested and also butchered according to state rules.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about food safety?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While no cases of transmission to humans have been reported, the Centers for Disease Control recommends that you do not consume meat from a CWD positive deer. And the National Deer Association encourages all hunters to adhere to the agency’s  guidelines regarding the handling or consumption of venison from CWD positive deer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to CDC, the high-risk parts include the brain, eyes, backbone and spleen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s why it’s important to bone out your harvest to avoid moving sensitive parts of the deer that could carry CWD.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boots on the ground: How hunters can help&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://deerassociation.com/cwd/"&gt;Go here&lt;/a&gt; for some advice from the National Deer Association about how hunters can help prevent the spread of CWD.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;        •       Know if you hunt in a CWD management zone where the disease has been found or will be traveling to hunt in a CWD zone. This is basic, crucial knowledge that helps you learn and follow regulations and guidelines designed to prevent the spread of CWD out of these zones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;  •     If you hunt in a CWD zone, submit all harvested deer to the state wildlife agency for CWD testing (and wait for satisfactory results before consuming the venison). Testing helps the agency keep tabs on the disease’s prevalence and location, which is crucial information for protecting the deer resource and hunting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;        •       If you hunt in a CWD zone, dispose of deer carcasses inside the zone following the recommendations of that state’s wildlife agency. Leave the zone only with boned-out meat, antlers connected to clean skull plates, clean hides, or clean jawbones/teeth. Most states now ban the importation of whole deer carcasses and are enforcing these laws.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;        •       If you kill a deer that tests positive for CWD, that’s a good thing. You removed an infected deer from the woods, which helps fight the disease. Don’t let it get you down. Collect your replacement tag from the state wildlife agency, keep hunting, and keep testing the deer you harvest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;        •       If you do not hunt in a CWD zone, but your state wildlife agency asks you to voluntarily submit deer for CWD testing, respond to the call for help. Submit your deer for testing. Discovering new CWD outbreaks early is critical to reducing the impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;        •       Report sick deer immediately to your state wildlife agency. Whether you see or harvest a deer that appears unhealthy, the state wildlife agency may want to examine and test the deer. Early detection of CWD is very important, so don’t hesitate to report sick deer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;        •       Harvest an appropriate number of does to maintain balance between deer density and forage availability where you hunt. Diseases that spread deer-to-deer like CWD move more slowly across the landscape in healthy deer densities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Devivo said that CWD is most prevalent in buck deer simply because buck deer have a larger home range than do does, and they have more contact with other deer because of breeding and fighting with other bucks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;        •       Connect with your state wildlife agency for information, even if you don’t hunt in or near a CWD zone. Sign up for the agency’s e-newsletter, follow them on social media, and attend public hearings whenever offered. Stay informed about all wildlife issues in your state, including deer health and hunting regulations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about ‘captive’ cervid farms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sometimes called “deer farms,’  captive cervid facilities are located on privately owned property. There are more than 10,000 captive-cervid breeding and shooting facilities in North America.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to a study from Texas A&amp;amp;M University, they are “perhaps the fastest growing industry in rural America.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The industry includes raising native or exotic cervids sold for such things as antlers, meat, breeding and even urine, which is used as an attractant. In some cases artificial breeding is used to produce larger cervids and antlers, which bring in good prices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it comes to CWD, what’s particularly troubling is that these operations often transport the animals to locations across North America, thus raising the risk of spreading the disease to other locations. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, too, since they’re often raised in dense populations, there’s more risk of CWD spreading should an animal have it. And even though the animals are fenced in, they sometimes “escape” and come into contact with wild cervids. There’s also the possible problem of “fence-to-fence” contact between captive and wild cervids.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The annual estimated economic impact of the cervid industry in Minnesota by 2012 was $17 million, with an estimated 1,287 jobs supported by this industry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, on the flip size of the coin, economic losses associated with CWD’s impact on the captive cervid industry for places like Alberta, Canada, range from $12 million (for prevention measures like improving fencing) to hundreds of millions (for compensation by the government for depopulation).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The impact of CWD on the captive cervid industry is not a future problem but a growing and ongoing reality,” says the report. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://wildlife.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/captive-cervid-breeding.pdf"&gt;Go here&lt;/a&gt; for more information about captive cervid farms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an opinion piece published by Fox News on Sunday, Kennedy said he was “deeply concerned” about the spread of the disease despite earlier suggesting that it was “not unusual”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="more-on"&gt;&lt;h2 class="more-on__heading"&gt;Recommended Stories &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list of 4 items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 1 of 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 2 of 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 3 of 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 4 of 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;end of list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons,” Kennedy wrote, though he said the decision to vaccinate is “a personal one”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US secretary of health and human services said that before the introduction of the MMR vaccine, “virtually every child” in the US contracted measles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For example, in the United States, from 1953 to 1962, on average there were 530,217 confirmed cases and 440 deaths, a case fatality rate of 1 in 1,205 cases,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US authorities last month reported the first measles death in the country in a decade after an unvaccinated school-aged child was hospitalised with the disease in northwest Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Friday, 146 cases had been identified in the state since late January, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials have said the cases have been concentrated in a community of Mennonites, a Christian sect that arose out of the radical factions of the 16th-century Reformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, who has &lt;a href="/news/2025/1/29/rfk-jrs-view-on-vaccines-comes-under-fire-at-contentious-us-senate-hearing"&gt;promoted scientifically discredited research&lt;/a&gt; linking vaccines to autism, attracted criticism last month when he appeared to downplay the outbreak by pointing out there had been several outbreaks already this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles can be highly dangerous for people who are not vaccinated, including young infants who are not typically eligible for immunisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About one in five unvaccinated individuals in the US who gets measles is hospitalised, while about one out of every 20 children with the disease gets pneumonia, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;

She was diagnosed with a condition she had never heard of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;This was her third ER trip with cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) in as many years. The first time she vomited for 12 hours, the second for 36 hours. This time, the worst and last, the intense pain lasted five days, during which, she was later told, she had hallucinatory conversations and threatened to leap from a fourth story window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Miriam, 45, who asked for professional reasons to use only her first name, had a legal marijuana prescription to treat both PTSD, acquired from years of driving an ambulance, and chronic pain from an auto accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;This was all true, but the real reason she needed cannabis that summer was that her mother was dying of a rare blood infection, and she had just been diagnosed with thyroid cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She needed emotional help. And help was at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Having used marijuana off and on since high school, Miriam had a high tolerance for THC, the drug’s main psychotropic compound. But after a single drag on a 95 percent pure THC vape pen purchased at a local medical dispensary, it felt like her body was in a vice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Every nerve was going off,” Miriam told me. “I hurt physically everywhere. If I had to choose between doing that again and being eaten by a bear, I would choose the bear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="The-race-to-legalize-marijuana" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;The race to legalize marijuana&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;CHS is rare but becoming less so. The key risk factors are long-term, frequent and heavy marijuana use. Symptoms begin with nausea, followed in later episodes, often separated by a year or more, by cyclical vomiting, dehydration, and emergency room visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The New York Times estimated last year that 6 million Americans may have CHS symptoms from using marijuana. The syndrome’s rates have risen as more Americans consume higher-potency cannabis with greater frequency. Over recent decades breeding has dramatically increased THC content in the plant itself, while purified THC products are now ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;At the federal level, marijuana remains a Schedule 1 illegal drug, alongside heroin, LSD and a few others. But at the state level, the race to legalization in recent years has been dizzying. Several states and territories have significantly liberalized marijuana access. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, as of January, 39 states allow medical marijuana, with 24 of those having fully legalized weed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;And yet, amid this enthusiasm, prominent health researchers are sounding alarms. And CHS is just one of several emerging concerns. While few experts now advocate a full return to prohibition, many do worry that the accelerating pace of easy access and heightened potency are outstripping scientific evidence on the safety of long-term marijuana use — and, when used as medicine, its efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In particular, many experts point to the long-term effects on the developing minds and bodies of adolescents and young adults, calling out overlooked risks of regular marijuana use to developing brains and bodies in their 20s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We allowed people to vote whether or not cannabis is a medicine,” noted Yasmin Hurd, a neurobiologist at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City. “Now we’re asking everybody in the country to be their own doctor with cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“That has never been done with any other medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Recent polls show that 88 percent of Americans favor legal medical use of cannabis, and 60 percent full legalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="What-science-says" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;What science says&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In 2023, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that nearly 44 million Americans used marijuana in the past month. By comparison, the same report cites 135 million daily alcohol users. “Far more people drink,” noted one study, “but high-frequency drinking is less common. In 2022, the median drinker reported drinking on 4–5 days in the past month, versus 15–16 days in the past month for cannabis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Among those daily or nearly-daily users are many who look to cannabis for help with assorted ailments. In 2018, the International Cannabis Policy Study found that 27 percent of North Americans between 16 and 65 had used cannabis to help with pain, sleep, migraines, anxiety, depression and PTSD. Conditions that qualify under Utah’s medical cannabis law include HIV, Alzheimer’s, ALS, cancer, Crohn’s disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Whether all these medical hopes could withstand random controlled trials is the key unanswered question. For now, the evidence is mostly weak or nonexistent. On treating PTSD with cannabis, for example, the American Psychiatric Association actually issued a &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatry.org/getattachment/0b3cc852-bc22-45ce-b9dc-9b98747889e7/Position-Cannabis-for-PTSD.pdf#:~:text=APA%20Position:%20Because%20of%20the%20lack%20of,the%20treatment%20of%20post%2Dtraumatic%20stress%20disorder%20(PTSD).&amp;amp;text=The%20APA%20does%20not%20endorse%20cannabis%20for,this%20time%2C%20as%20further%20study%20is%20needed." target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;formal statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; opposing the use of cannabis to treat PTSD, emphasizing that “no published evidence of sufficient quality exists in the medical literature to support the practice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In 2017, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released an exhaustive report on cannabis science and policy that remains the most widely-cited reference. For medical uses, the National Academies study found “insufficient or no evidence.” But it did support improvements in three areas: “chronic pain,” “chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting,” and “spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But even the study’s chronic pain section concludes that “very little is known about the efficacy, dose, routes of administration, or side effects” and warns that the products being sold to consumers and patients bear “little resemblance to the products that are available for research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="'I'd-never-had-access-to-anything-that-strong'" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;‘I’d never had access to anything that strong'&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Utah’s dispensaries are home to a huge variety of THC materials. In addition to raw cannabis flower, there are vapes, liquids, concentrates, tinctures, topicals and edibles. Gummies are available in a multitude of fruit flavors. And vape cartridges come with names like “galactic gas,” “piña gluelada,” “mountain diesel” and “pappy poison.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Utah medical cannabis law allows up to 113 grams of raw cannabis flower a month. Depending on the potency, that could be enough for seven joints a day. On top of that, the law allows 20 grams of purified THC in other forms like edibles, tinctures and vapes. That’s enough for 66 potent gummies every day. No one really could handle that much. In short, under Utah law there is nothing stopping a willing doctor from giving eager patients all the THC their body could handle and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Just contemplating the plethora of delivery devices and variety of formulas and potencies on the dispensary sales floor is nearly as mind-blowing as consuming them. “I’ve been smoking pot since I was 14,” Miriam said, “but I’d never had access to anything that strong.” It was there, in her local Utah dispensary, that Miriam purchased the 95 percent pure THC vape pen that sparked her final cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote cite="" class="c-stack dn-article-body__pullquote " data-style-direction="vertical" data-style-justification="start" data-style-alignment="unset" data-style-inline="false" data-style-wrap="nowrap"&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We allowed people to vote whether or not cannabis is a medicine. Now we’re asking everybody in the country to be their own doctor with cannabis. That has never been done with any other medicine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Exactly how THC affects the body is still a mystery. Not until 1988 did researchers begin to map the delicate system we now call the endocannabinoid system, a network of receptors and internal cannabinoids that are active throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The network relies on subtle nudges to modulate stress, appetite, hormones, memory, emotions, sleep, body temperature, pain and the immune system. That sweeping portfolio may in time uncover previously unimaginable treatments for difficult conditions, says UC Irvine’s Daniele Piomelli, who since the early 1990s has been a key player in endocannabinoid system research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Piomelli is a neuroscientist who argues that the brain cannot be considered separately from the body. “The endocannabinoid system works in all these tissues and all these organs,” Piomelli said. And the daily use of THC in adolescence will permanently affect how the ECS works in organs that regulate health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;A flood of THC appears to slow internal cannabinoid production and attenuate receptor networks, Piomelli said. More THC is then required for a similar effect, a key marker of addiction. Those system disruptions can also lead to severe inflammation and immune and digestive problems, such as Miriam experienced with CHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;A 2022 study in Colorado linked cannabis to increased temporary psychosis. A recent article on the Yale School of Medicine website noted that “heavy and early use of cannabis is associated with increased risk of developing schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Neurobiologist Yasmin Hurd has done pathbreaking work on the neurological risks of adolescent THC use, but she also studies the therapeutic potential of cannabidiol for opioid addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Now a professor at the Mt. Sinai Medical Center’s Icahn School of Medicine, Hurd has been working since the early 1990s with rats, first studying cocaine, amphetamine and heroin addictions. When she turned to cannabis 20 years ago, her colleagues laughed. “Oh, that’s not a drug, you know,” they said. At the time, most people were still convinced cannabis was not truly biologically addictive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But she found that rats given THC as adolescents would self-administer heroin at higher rates once they were adults. At least for rats, it was now clear that the cannabis gateway to opiates is biological.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“People aren’t laughing at me that much anymore,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Hurd also found that brain scans of adult rats exposed to THC as adolescents showed attenuated neural networks. Those scans, she says, look very similar to human schizophrenia. Subsequent human studies, Hurd says, have confirmed that “adolescent exposure to cannabis does indeed change the prefrontal cortical in a manner similar to what we had shown in animals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Hurd also notes a Danish epidemiological study that showed a strong correlation between increased cannabis use and potency and rising schizophrenia rates. That study found much lower schizophrenia rates among those who began cannabis use after they turned 26, suggesting a link to prefrontal cortex maturation. Most experts now see the evidence linking adolescent cannabis use to heightened schizophrenia as compelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Hurd makes a point of clarifying “adolescence.” Neurologically, human adolescence does not end until age 25, when the prefrontal cortex matures. Women mature a bit earlier and men a bit later. At 21, legal young adults are still neurological adolescents, and will be for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In a finding Hurd fairly describes as scary, her lab also discovered that rats given THC as adolescents can pass epigenetic damage to the second and third generation. Descendants struggled to manage stress and were more prone to self-administer heroin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;But Hurd is not only framing problems; she is also looking for solutions. She began studying cannabidiol (CBD) long before it became popular. Like THC, cannabidiol is an important compound in the cannabis plant, but it has very different effects. The balance of CBD and THC is often considered critical in therapeutic uses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“We found that CBD actually did the opposite to THC,” she said. “Animals exposed to CBD reduced their heroin seeking.” Hurd is now a co-principal investigator in advanced clinical trials, with results so far confirming that CBD can be used to effectively reduce opiate craving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;When she began researching THC’s impact on adolescent brains, Hurd says the cannabis industry marked her as an enemy. Once she began researching cannabidiol therapies, the industry decided she might be OK. But she has never cared about what they think. “Follow the data,” she tells her research team. “No matter what the results are, the data tells us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote cite="" class="c-stack dn-article-body__pullquote " data-style-direction="vertical" data-style-justification="start" data-style-alignment="unset" data-style-inline="false" data-style-wrap="nowrap"&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“People should not be using it when they’re young and their brains are still developing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Following data is easier said than done. Everybody is using different kinds of medical cannabis for dozens of different conditions, said Ryan Vandrey, a psychiatry professor at the Johns Hopkins medical school, “but they’re all doing it different, making it very hard to integrate the data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Databases demand consistent inputs. To make that possible, Vandrey and his colleagues at Johns Hopkins recently got a $10 million grant for a five-year project to create a standardized assessment and collect large quantities of observational data that will, they hope, be followed by good clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“If you were to ask me which health conditions should be studied with a large clinical trial,” Vandrey told me, “and what the product would be, I couldn’t tell you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="'It-was-not-an-easy-decision'" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;‘It was not an easy decision’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The stories Vandrey needs are in the files of general practitioners like Dr. Matt McIff. About 100 of McIff’s patients currently use medical cannabis, mostly for chronic pain. However, he opposes recreational legalization — or even casual medical legalization where the difference gets blurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;McIff illustrates his approach with two cases from his practice. Fittingly, they serve as bookends to Yasmin Hurd’s dual research tracks: CBD for opioid addiction and adolescent THC risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The first case is a carpenter with chronic pain from a work injury who disclosed that he had for years struggled with opiate painkiller addiction but was now sober, implying that he white-knuckled his recovery — a rare and difficult feat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;With his curiosity piqued, McIff asked directly if the patient had used cannabis to overcome opiate cravings. Of course, he had. “After I assured him it was OK,” McIff said, “his eyes got really big and he teared up. He was so relieved to have his experience legitimized.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The patient still uses a moderate cannabis dose for sleep and pain, a careful balance of THC and cannabidiol. But he is opiate-free, married with two children, and runs a business with 10 employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;On the flip side, McIff tells of a 17-year-old patient who had self-medicated for his anxiety with cannabis obtained from friends. McIff walked the mother and son through the risks of adolescent cannabis — CHS, addiction risks, cognitive dysfunction and harms to the developing brain and body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Finally, he suggested that teens who use cannabis for anxiety may shortchange their emotional development. The stress and confusion in youth, he said, is sometimes just part of learning life skills under pressure. Early cannabis use that masks stress may not only damage neural networks but also undercut psychological growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“If you are 17 and feeling stressed and you haven’t developed emotional skills,” McIff told me, “cannabis becomes a substitute.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;McIff is an outspoken advocate of supervised medical cannabis, but also an outspoken opponent of recreational legalization. In his view, the very respect he has for the drug’s potency pushes back against its unsupervised casual use for entertainment or self-medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;McIff’s reticence on legalization makes him a bit of an outlier. Despite layer upon layer of health concerns, none of the other experts I spoke with favored continued prohibition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;For example, Christopher Andrews, a gastroenterologist in Calgary, Canada, and an expert on cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome, was philosophical when I asked about Canada’s permissive 18- to 21-year-old limit for recreational cannabis, given the developmental realities of the human body noted above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“People should not be using it when they’re young and their brains are still developing,” Andrews said. But he was sympathetic to Canadian policymakers, who feared the black-market realities of trying to enforce prohibition until a later age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“It was not an easy decision,” Andrews said. “That’s for sure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Rather than going back to a policy of blanket prohibition, most researchers I spoke with, like Andrews, are focused on doing the long-delayed science required to better quantify both the perils and promise of cannabis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote cite="" class="c-stack dn-article-body__pullquote " data-style-direction="vertical" data-style-justification="start" data-style-alignment="unset" data-style-inline="false" data-style-wrap="nowrap"&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Follow the data. No matter what the results are, the data tells us.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Not all doctors who prescribe cannabis are as careful as McIff. Miriam, for example, got her prescription from a doctor she had never previously met, located in a cannabis medical clinic in the same building as the dispensary. “You sit down at a desk with the doctor. They ask you a few questions, and then they write you a prescription and you walk out the door,” Miriam said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;No one probed her underlying needs, checked on current therapies, explored alternatives — or even taught her how to balance THC and cannabidiol. Miriam finds it alarming that neither the doctor nor the dispensary staff warned her of CHS — a foreseeable risk, however rare, that she would have recognized in her own profile if it had been described.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Now with 18 months of recovery behind her, Miriam makes a surprising admission. She’s glad she was forced to quit. Cold turkey recovery, she says, made her realize she had been using not just for pain and PTSD, and not just to grieve her current loss, but also to bury unresolved emotional issues from her youth. “I used pot to avoid dealing with my stuff,” she said. “It was convenient that it was legal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;After her crisis, Miriam spent three months at home on bed rest. With little else to do, she joined remote group therapy sessions twice a day. At first her engagement was perfunctory, even petulant. Uncovering old hurts and grieving new losses without her chemical crutch was wrenching. But the payoff was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Having to grieve my mom and grieve having cancer 100 percent sober was the best thing that ever happened to me,” she said. “I have less pain than I’ve ever had in my life. I have less anxiety. And I’m so glad that I can’t smoke pot.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story appears in the March 2025 issue of&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.deseret.com/magazine/"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Deseret Magazine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://pages.deseret.com/subscribe?utm_source=deseret&amp;amp;utm_medium=deseret_com&amp;amp;utm_campaign=learn_more_subscribe_footers"&gt;&lt;i&gt; Learn more about how to subscribe&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2025 04:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxOeERTVHM3ZEkxeVprWDQwZzlWVmRkOHA1RDN1YzNGY1VWOXlKSi1lTGxmZDJHYVdBaldudjAxNlZkM2NoSzhvcjlfQ3k2QjRXdElaR2VzZk5ncHVGVTk1R1BjQzJvREVTNkRvRVUwdmxnVlc2Mld5QlV5VHVFaEs0ZDllXzl4MjVUZmJhdw</guid></item><item><title>Montgomery County reports measles case linked to international travel - 69News WFMZ-TV</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgJBVV95cUxNVVVMWnNlRTNkMG5pVnNnOGlZczJidTdibkFZS1A5d0RPdVFaYjVFQThkTHM0Wk5icThvbG9kWnhsRmhNeFNha25pQnZNSzA2LThoOFgyMHJ0Uzc2WFpEelhIQkNnTmlRZnpaRXhUQm05aUExcUc4SDJMVXJURy1jbldJbUtIWTFJdTJta29fRWVyTzNvWmRZVGxNS2txWm8xTnBLaHB4OUdyeHhFZ2JpQzZkS096SzdPTTZoQV9XY0x3Tjd0RWVERjZYNmtMNFNMemxhaUdrX2ZMU1lRTkVqOXQtTjBUeWNXTHZyWlo2Skd4VkUxUG5VWlczSW9MVmt3bXNWelJYaGtOVWhSZUltS3RFNHQxTkY1WEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody" class="asset-content  subscriber-premium" false&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;MONTGOMERY CO., Pa. - "They took the appropriate precautions, they did the appropriate testing," said Dr. Lorraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the county, people may have been exposed on a China Airlines shuttle bus departing JFK Airport, arriving in North Philadelphia February 25th into the 26th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Children's Hospital on the 26th, the county said people may also have been exposed at True North Pediatrics Associates of Plymouth in Plymouth Meeting on the same date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The good news is that the vaccine is highly effective against measles," said Dr. Lorraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said droplets can linger for two hours in a space after someone with the virus leaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lorraine said the county maintains fairly good vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_middle" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He spoke about what symptoms come along with measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Typically, we'll see pretty high fevers and all the concomitant symptoms that would be associated with that, it can cause seizures if it becomes significantly elevated, cough, shortness of breath. These are all very, very common," said Dr. Lorraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said in Texas there is a spread within a population that is specifically unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our situation is definitely different. This is essentially a one-off. It was a case of a child who was too young to be vaccinated traveled to an area where measles happens to be endemic and happened to unfortunately contract the disease," said Dr. Lorraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Lorraine said if you suspect you have measles, to seek medical attention and to let the facility you are going to know you are coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the best defense is to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Danielle Roberts, from North Wales, told the BBC that she experienced financial "strain" as soon as her nine-year-old daughter Jasmine was diagnosed with cancer last year, but she did not receive any benefits for eight months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We were just thrown into this world where...our child's got cancer and we don't know if she's going to survive, along with dealing with the financial impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"You've still got all these bills to pay on top of going back and forward to hospital, which was an hour and 15 minutes away, extra food, accommodation".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ms Roberts said having to take long periods off work added to the financial strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"My income was dramatically reduced because it's hard to work when your child is in hospital... and you don't want to work, you should be able to spend time with your child when they're poorly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2

money in savings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Having to wait seven months for disability benefits is driving a lot of families into debt and impacting families at a time they just want to concentrate on getting their child well." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The charity is also concerned about the application process, as the 50-page forms were "tricky, long and complex", asking families for detailed descriptions about their child's needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The process should be made "simple and efficient", it says, by using medical evidence alone to make applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Ms Roberts said she struggled to find the "head space" to complete the application form when her daughter Jasmine was ill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"They asked so many questions and you've got to send added proof... you don't want to have to think about that really as well as 'is my

diseases misdiagnosed as psychosomati -

                            &lt;p&gt;A ‘chasm of misunderstanding and miscommunication’ is often experienced between clinicians and patients, leading to autoimmune diseases such as lupus and vasculitis being wrongly diagnosed as psychiatric or psychosomatic conditions, with a profound and lasting impact on patients, researchers have found.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A study involving over 3,000 participants – both patients and clinicians – found that these misdiagnoses (sometimes termed “in your head” by patients) were often associated with long term impacts on patients’ physical health and wellbeing and damaged trust in healthcare services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers are calling for greater awareness among clinicians of the symptoms of such diseases, which they recognise can be difficult to diagnose, and for more support for patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Autoimmune rheumatic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and vasculitis are chronic inflammatory disorders that affect the immune system and can damage organs and tissues throughout the body. They can be very difficult to diagnose as people report a wide range of different symptoms, many of which can be invisible, such as extreme fatigue and depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Melanie Sloan from the University of Cambridge led a study exploring patient-reported experiences from two large groups, each of over 1,500 patients, and in-depth interviews with 67 patients and 50 clinicians. The results are published today in &lt;em&gt;Rheumatology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patients who reported that their autoimmune disease was misdiagnosed as psychosomatic or a mental health condition were more likely to experience higher levels of depression and anxiety, and lower mental wellbeing. For example, one patient with multiple autoimmune diseases said: “One doctor told me I was making myself feel pain and I still can’t forget those words. Telling me I’m doing it to myself has made me very anxious and depressed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 80% said it had damaged their self-worth and 72% of patients reported that the misdiagnosis still upset them, often even decades later. Misdiagnosed patients also reported lower levels of satisfaction with every aspect of medical care and were more likely to distrust doctors, downplay their symptoms, and avoid healthcare services. As one patient reported, it “has damaged my trust and courage in telling doctors very much. I even stopped taking my immunosuppressive medicine because of those words”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following these types of misdiagnoses, patients often then blamed themselves for their condition, as one individual described: “I don’t deserve help because this is a disease I’ve brought on myself. You go back to those initial diagnosis, you’ve always got their voices in your head, saying you’re doing this to yourself. You just can’t ever shake that. I’ve tried so hard.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One patient described the traumatising response their doctor’s judgement had on them: “When a rheumatologist dismissed me I was already suicidal, this just threw me over the edge. Thankfully I am terrible at killing myself, it’s so much more challenging than you think. But the dreadful dismissiveness of doctors when you have a bizarre collection of symptoms is traumatizing and you start to believe them, that it’s all in your head.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Melanie Sloan, from the Department of Public Health and Primary Care at the University of Cambridge, said: “Although many doctors were intending to be reassuring in suggesting a psychosomatic or psychiatric cause for initially unexplainable symptoms, these types of misdiagnoses can create a multitude of negative feelings and impacts on lives, self-worth and care. These appear to rarely be resolved even after the correct diagnoses. We must do better at helping these patients heal, and in educating clinicians to consider autoimmunity at an earlier stage.”      &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinicians highlighted how hard it was to diagnose autoimmune rheumatic diseases and that there was a high risk of misdiagnosis. Some doctors said they hadn’t really thought about the long-term problems for patients, but others talked about the problems in regaining trust, as one GP from England highlighted: “They lose trust in anything that anyone says…you are trying to convince them that something is OK, and they will say yes but a doctor before said that and was wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there was evidence that this trust can be rebuilt. One patient described having been “badly gaslit by a clinician”, but that when they told the clinician this, “She was shocked and had no idea … She was great. Took it on the chin. Listened and heard. Apologised profusely…For me, the scar of the original encounter was transformed into something much more positive.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mike Bosley, autoimmune patient and co-author on the study, said: “We need more clinicians to understand how a misdiagnosis of this sort can result in long-standing mental and emotional harm and in a disastrous loss of trust in doctors. Everyone needs to appreciate that autoimmune conditions can present in these unusual ways, that listening carefully to patients is key to avoiding the long-lasting harm that a mental health or psychosomatic misdiagnosis can cause.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study authors recommend several measures for improving support for patients with autoimmune rheumatological diseases. These are likely to apply for many other groups of patients with chronic diseases that are often misunderstood and initially misdiagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They propose that clinicians should talk about previous misdiagnoses with patients, discuss and empathise with their patients as to the effects on them, and offer targeted support to reduce the long-term negative impacts. Health services should ensure greater access to psychologists and talking therapies for patients reporting previous misdiagnoses, which may reduce the long-term impact on wellbeing, healthcare behaviours, and patient-doctor relationships. Education may reduce misdiagnoses by encouraging clinicians to consider systemic autoimmunity when they assess patients with multiple, seemingly unconnected, physical and mental health symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professor Felix Naughton, from the Lifespan Health Research Centre at the University of East Anglia, said: “Diagnosing autoimmune rheumatic diseases can be challenging, but with better awareness among clinicians of how they present, we can hopefully reduce the risk of misdiagnoses. And while there will unfortunately inevitably still be patients whose condition is not correctly diagnosed, with the correct support in place, we may be able to lessen the impact on them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by LUPUS UK and The Lupus Trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Green, author of best-selling &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.johngreenbooks.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.johngreenbooks.com/" aria-label="books"&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; including &lt;em&gt;The Fault in Our Stars&lt;/em&gt;, could have done anything. He could have written yet another young adult book, or made a new film. But he chose to write a new book on tuberculosis (TB)! &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://everythingistb.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://everythingistb.com/" aria-label="Everything Is Tuberculosis"&gt;&lt;em data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://everythingistb.com/"&gt;Everything Is Tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is releasing on 18th March, a few days ahead of World Tuberculosis Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a tuberculosis researcher, I am deeply aware of what this devastating disease has done to humankind, and why it kills &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/global-tuberculosis-report-2024/global-tb-report-2024_factsheet.pdf?sfvrsn=fee1c310_4&amp;amp;download=true" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/global-tuberculosis-report-2024/global-tb-report-2024_factsheet.pdf?sfvrsn=fee1c310_4&amp;amp;download=true" aria-label="over a million"&gt;over a million&lt;/a&gt; people every year, even today. But, initially, I struggled to understand why John Green would care about this ancient ‘white plague’ that has likely killed over a billion people in the past couple of centuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending some time with John at a Partners in Health (PIH) event last fall, I started to better understand why the man cares about TB, and why he has become such a powerful advocate for a disease that gets little attention. My interview with him offers deeper insights into John’s obsession with TB. You have to, of course, read his book to get the full story!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed-base image-embed embed-5" role="presentation"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;p class="color-body light-text" role="button"&gt;'Everything is Tuberculosis' is a new book by John Green, published by Penguin Random House (2025)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;small&gt;Madhukar Pai&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madhukar Pai&lt;/strong&gt;: John, you have written several best-selling novels and have reached millions of young adults worldwide. You could have stuck to that successful genre. What made you write a book on tuberculosis? After all, you live in the United States, and your risk of getting TB is very low. Why do you care about TB?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Green&lt;/strong&gt;: I wrote a nonfiction book before this called &lt;em&gt;The Anthropocene Reviewed&lt;/em&gt;, but this is my first crack at writing about illness and disease in a nonfiction format. Disease has long interested me as a subject for literature because as Virginia Woolf wrote, it is “strange indeed that illness has not taken its place with love, battle, and jealousy among the prime themes of literature.” After all, it’s a universal experience–and one responsible for over 90% of human deaths. I’m especially fascinated by tuberculosis because it is so obviously and so painfully a disease of injustice. TB kills 1,250,000 people every year even though it’s been curable since the 1950s. That’s a tremendous failure of our resource distribution systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madhukar Pai&lt;/strong&gt;: In your book, you do a wonderful job of tracing the history of TB, and its ongoing impact on people even today. Currently, TB is the biggest infectious killer of people, and things might get even worse with the new U.S. government’s attack on humanitarian aid, science, and global health (which I covered in an earlier &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/madhukarpai/2025/02/20/paul-farmers-moral-clarity-offers-hope-amidst-chaos-and-darkness/" data-ga-track="InternalLink:https://www.forbes.com/sites/madhukarpai/2025/02/20/paul-farmers-moral-clarity-offers-hope-amidst-chaos-and-darkness/" target="_self" aria-label="post"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;). You write in your book “We know how to live in a world without TB. But we choose not to live in that world.” Can you please explain this for the readers?&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class="embed-base embedly-align"&gt;&lt;fbs-embedly iframe-src="https://embedly.forbes.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FCCbDdk8Wz-8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DCCbDdk8Wz-8&amp;amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FCCbDdk8Wz-8%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;amp;schema=youtube"&gt;&lt;/fbs-embedly&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Green&lt;/strong&gt;: We know how to eliminate tuberculosis from communities. We know that comprehensive response–where we actively search for cases, treat every sick person we find, and offer preventive therapy to their close contacts–can reliably end chains of transmission. We have better tools (e.g. molecular tests) and shorter medication regimens than ever before. TB is curable and preventable. We have the tools to end TB, but we are not allocating the appropriate resources to the fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madhukar Pai&lt;/strong&gt;: Your great-uncle died of tuberculosis in the 1930s in the US. My maternal grandfather died of TB in the 1940s in India. Neither of them had a fighting chance those days, since no cure was available. But today, we have excellent rapid molecular tests, we can quickly check for drug-resistance, and we have short, effective drug combinations. Even drug-resistant TB can now be cured with 6 months of oral medications. And yet, as you put it, paraphrasing Ugandan AIDS researcher and physician Peter Mugyenyi, TB cure is where the disease is not, and TB disease is where the cure is not. What can we do about this problem and make sure everyone has the best tools we have to detect, prevent and cure TB?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Green&lt;/strong&gt;: We have to get the cure to the disease, which is not easy or straightforward but is possible. We need to get the cure to rural areas of Lesotho where people are dying needlessly of TB for want of medications that we first synthesized many decades ago. And we need to do a much better job of screening and active case-finding so we’re not identifying TB only when it is extremely advanced. In short, to fight our oldest pandemic, we need to treat it like we would any other pandemic, rather than minimizing and dismissing it because it mostly affects the poor or people in the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madhukar Pai&lt;/strong&gt;: You are more than a book author. You are an advocate for TB. You are using your megaphone to call out the injustices in access to tools. You worked hard with advocacy groups and Nerdfighteria to reduce the price of a rapid molecular test by &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2023/09/14/john-green-cepheid-danaher-tb-test-genexpert/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2023/09/14/john-green-cepheid-danaher-tb-test-genexpert/" aria-label="Cepheid"&gt;Cepheid&lt;/a&gt; (Danaher), and to make &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.science.org/content/article/major-drug-company-bends-battle-over-access-key-tb-treatment" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.science.org/content/article/major-drug-company-bends-battle-over-access-key-tb-treatment" aria-label="bedaquiline"&gt;bedaquiline&lt;/a&gt; drug (by J&amp;amp;J) more accessible. What made you translate your words into concrete action? Who inspires you to be an advocate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Green&lt;/strong&gt;: I am inspired by my fellow TB fighters, and especially by those who paved the way for me, like &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/03/24/india-should-heed-a-teenagers-historic-fight-for-lifesaving-tuberculosis-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.statnews.com/2019/03/24/india-should-heed-a-teenagers-historic-fight-for-lifesaving-tuberculosis-treatment/" aria-label="Shreya Tripathi"&gt;Shreya Tripathi&lt;/a&gt;, a young woman from India who died of TB amidst a years-long battle with Indian courts to be able to access the anti-TB medication bedaquiline. Shreya died because the world is unjust, and while I would’ve received bedaquiline with no problem, she had to fight for it until just before her death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madhukar Pai&lt;/strong&gt;: Our mutual friend, the late Dr &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.pih.org/article/how-dr-paul-farmer-revolutionized-tuberculosis-care" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.pih.org/article/how-dr-paul-farmer-revolutionized-tuberculosis-care" aria-label="Paul Farmer"&gt;Paul Farmer&lt;/a&gt;, showed the world that we can offer quality TB care even in countries with limited resources. How did Paul influence your thinking about TB and global health in general? What lessons of his do you remember the most?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Green:&lt;/strong&gt; Paul influenced every aspect of my life, from the way I think about marriage to the way I think about work to my passion for global health equity. He inspired me and so many others to expand our imagination of what might be possible. Paul helped me to understand that TB and other diseases of injustice are not &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;caused by bacteria or other pathogens. They are really caused by human-built systems, which means they can also be cured by reforming and reimagining human-built systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madhukar Pai&lt;/strong&gt;: In a recent &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/384524/john-green-author-youtuber-tuberculosis-advocacy-future-perfect-50" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/384524/john-green-author-youtuber-tuberculosis-advocacy-future-perfect-50" aria-label="interview"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; in Vox, you spoke about wanting to make the ‘world suck less.’ I love it and use that as a tag line for teaching why global health matters and my students love it! Beyond the TB crisis, the world is now facing many challenges, including climate crisis, pandemics, conflicts, widening economic inequities, and right-wing, autocratic, leaders who are &lt;a class="color-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/health/usaid-contract-terminations.html?unlocked_article_code=1.0U4.xWCP.ORg1Djx7b4cR&amp;amp;smid=url-share" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/27/health/usaid-contract-terminations.html?unlocked_article_code=1.0U4.xWCP.ORg1Djx7b4cR&amp;amp;smid=url-share" aria-label="undermining"&gt;undermining&lt;/a&gt; years of progress. How do we stay hopeful in this era of polycrisis and fading democracy? What advice would you have for young people who look up to you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Green&lt;/strong&gt;: I think hope is the correct response to the miracle of human consciousness. I am extremely concerned (and discouraged) in the face of our historical moment. But I refuse to respond with despair. The year I graduated from high school, 1995, over twelve million children died before the age of five. Last year, fewer than five million kids died. As you note, that progress is currently being undermined–and that’s catastrophic. But we can look to that progress in hope. There is nothing natural or inevitable about the world reducing child mortality by 60% in 25 years. That happened because of millions of people working together in the messy, complex, often unseen labor of building and maintaining better healthcare systems. Those builders and maintainers are the people who give me hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madhukar Pai&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you, John, for your incredible global health work, philanthropy, and your passion for making the world suck less. You are breathing new life into TB and global health advocacy, and we need it now, more than ever before. Paul Farmer would have called you an antidote to despair.&lt;/p&gt;

Some of the "low hanging fruit" of improvements in heart disease and cancer, such as the cut in smoking rates, had already happened, making further gains harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;At the same time, the UK saw rising risk factors, including obesity, poor diet and low levels of exercise, against a backdrop of widening social inequality and pressure on the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Some academics argue that austerity cuts to public services after the 2008 financial crash had a strong impact on life expectancy, while others say it's not possible to prove this directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dementia and Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of death in England and Wales, according to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregistrationsummarytables/2023" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;latest official figures&lt;/a&gt;. Heart disease, lung disease, strokes, lung cancer also feature highly, along with flu in some years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Cardiovascular disease remains a leading killer in the UK," said Prof Bryan Williams OBE, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The plateau we have seen in reducing the number of deaths... is a serious cause for concern, made worse by the impact of the pandemic on an already overstretched health service."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He added that early deaths from cardiovascular disease had grown in the most deprived areas of England and called for "urgent government action" in its prevention, detection and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Deaths at younger ages&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Overall death rates are largely a reflection of older people's health as more than three-quarters of UK deaths happen over the age of 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;So the main trend is driven by what is happening to people in this age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But the CMI found "really significant differences" at younger ages says Stuart McDonald, with a "concerning" upward trend in mortality among 20-44-year-olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"For this age group, death rates have actually been going up slightly, even before the pandemic.

			&lt;p&gt;Ever set off too many of the bitter taste receptors on your tongue? You probably spat out whatever it was in your mouth, and that's our best guess for why we even have them: to stop us from ingesting things that might be harmful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our skin cells have the same receptors, which serve a&lt;span&gt; similar purpose on a cellular level: to detect bitter substances. &lt;/span&gt;New research led by Okayama University of Science biologists builds on our knowledge of the type-2 taste receptors (TAS2Rs) found in the skin's keratinocytes, finding their role is also to keep potentially harmful materials from sticking around and causing damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once thought to be confined to the tongue, TAS2Rs are actually spread much further throughout the body. They line your colon, your stomach, and your upper airways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://karger.com/spp/article-abstract/28/3/137/295760/Expression-and-Functional-Activity-of-the-Bitter?redirectedFrom=fulltext"&gt;2015 paper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; discovered them not just lurking but bristling with activity in the keratinized epithelial cells of human skin. &lt;/span&gt;The new research gets into the question of what exactly they are doing there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lab-grown human keratinocytes were fed the quintessential 'bitter pill,' &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenylthiocarbamide"&gt;phenylthiocarbamide&lt;/a&gt; (PTC), which has been used in all sorts of studies around the genetics of bitter taste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On detecting and binding with the PTC, the receptors triggered production of a fleet of ABC transporters to shuttle the bitter compound across the membranes and back out of the cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_153454" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-153454" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/fba21469-fig-0007-m.jpg" alt="diagram showing how bitter substances activate receptors which trigger production of abcb1, which helps excrete the substance.

(Mori et al., &lt;em&gt;FASEB BioAdvances&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine whether this newly-installed exit was functional, the team administered a visible tracer dye which could be rapidly excreted from the cell via a specific ABC transporter. When the team treated the cells with a substance called verapmil which is known to inhibit the transporter, the tracer had no way out, allowing it to accumulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers think this chain of events set off by the TAS2Rs protects the cell from being damaged by potentially toxic bitter compounds, a premise that runs in line with theories about &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/chemse/bjp092"&gt;why we can taste 'bitter'&lt;/a&gt; at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to taste on the tongue, the jury is still out on whether bitterness actually helps us detect harmful substances. &lt;a href="https://iubmb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/iub.1694"&gt;Studies have found&lt;/a&gt; this flavor profile may not be such a helpful indicator of toxicity as we once thought, with many popular foods and drinks featuring a bitter flavour profile, and many toxic substances lacking it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this latest study shows that among skin cells, at least, the receptors might have some benefit in surviving exposure to toxins. Cells that were given a toxic level of antihistamine &lt;span&gt;had much better survival rates when their bitter receptors had been fired up prior. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A&lt;span&gt;ctivation of TAS2Rs by bitter compounds, such as PTC and saccharin, enhances ABCB1 production, leading to the prevention of diphenhydramin-induced cell death via excretion of these compounds," the authors &lt;a href="https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1096/fba.2024-00074"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verapamil also reversed this protective effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"&lt;span&gt;Altogether, harmless activators of TAS2Rs may be promising drugs that enhance the excretion of toxic substances from the human skin," the authors &lt;a href="https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1096/fba.2024-00074"&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
