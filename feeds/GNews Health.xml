Around 15 million American women get one every year and more than half of women and about 12 percent of men will experience at least one episode in their lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smith has had bladder issues for years, she said, and UTIs were not uncommon for her. They are the result of bacteria entering the urinary tract through the urethra and beginning to spread in the bladder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Poor hygiene, sexual activity, or even just the anatomy of the urinary tract can give bacteria an easy entry point. Once inside, these microbes attach to the bladder lining, triggering inflammation and the familiar symptoms, including a relentless urge to urinate, burning discomfort, and sometimes cloudy or bloody urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Left unchecked, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14797205/UTI-amputated-limbs.html"&gt;the infection can&lt;/a&gt; climb toward the kidneys, turning a mild to moderate pain into a serious health threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smith noticed pain in her lower back while on vacation with her husband. She suspected a UTI was coming, but tried to enjoy her vacation until she woke up one night in agonizing pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the hospital, Smith was placed in a medically-induced coma as a runaway immune response to a standard UTI spiraled into catastrophic damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Kim Smith is now a quadruple amputee after a urinary tract infection went untreated for too long and she developed sepsis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Smith and her husband had sought medical care &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/kim-smith-520?utm_medium=CR&amp;amp;utm_source=CL"&gt;in early 2018&lt;/a&gt; before her body devolved into septic shock. According to Smith, they were turned away by the doctors but given a prescription for antibiotics that the local pharmacy was not able to fill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The following night, she awoke in pain and struggled to breathe. Her speech was slurred, and she was out of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As inflammatory chemicals flood the bloodstream, they damage the delicate blood vessels in the lungs, causing fluid to leak into the air sacs, which causes a condition called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This drowns the lungs from within, stiffening them like waterlogged sponges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the same time, plummeting blood pressure (septic shock) starves tissues of oxygen, while muscle weakness from acidosis and organ failure makes the physical act of breathing more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sepsis also plunges the brain into a state of chaos, causing confusion and speech difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A storm of inflammatory chemicals can disrupt signaling between brain cells, while liver or kidney failure allows toxins like ammonia to build up, further clouding cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even when oxygen reaches cells, toxins and mitochondrial dysfunction prevent them from using it. As tissues suffocate, organs fail in a domino effect, starting with the kidneys, then the lungs, which fill with fluid, and then the limbs, which can turn black from gangrene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;When Smith was airlifted back to the UK, her limbs had turned black from the lack of oxygenated blood, forcing doctors to amputate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without immediate medical attention, widespread oxygen deprivation leads to irreversible damage. Nearly half of septic shock patients progress to multi-organ failure, where survival odds plummet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When Smith was airlifted back to the UK, her limbs had turned black from the lack of oxygenated blood, forcing doctors to amputate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘How I survived, I do not know. It’s a miracle, but I think it’s so that I can warn you and save your life,’ she &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kims2dchance/video/7525781719782296854"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than one million patients are hospitalized for sepsis each year, surpassing even heart attack and stroke combined in hospitalization rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those with chronic illnesses, including cancer, kidney disease, or neurological disorders, face especially high risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Between one in eight and one in four patients with sepsis will die during hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I’m here to warn you that if you’ve got any infection at all, don’t think it won’t happen to you because I was fit and healthy and it happened to me. And it could be you. Watch out for symptoms of sepsis,’ Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I grew up in the United Kingdom, where healthcare is supposed to be free and equal for everyone, and spent the last eight years in New York City, home to some of the best teaching hospitals and research centers in the world. And yet, here I was, at a niche clinic a thousand miles from home, because I was hoping to do the most ordinary thing in the world: become a mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sat in the waiting room with my husband, Nick, and my mum, who’d flown in from Scotland for moral support. On the wall were cards from patients, beautiful photos of newborn babies, heartfelt notes of thanks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at them felt bittersweet. I wondered what each mother’s journey had been like. Would I, like them, be a success story? Or might I be the exception—a particularly hopeless case?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had known for years that I likely had a gynecological disorder that is impossible to diagnose without a surgeon cutting holes in the abdomen and examining the inside of the pelvis with a camera. A doctor had told me it might affect my fertility. But after I’d gotten married, in 2023, I got pregnant. Then I lost my baby to miscarriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In America, around 13 percent of women struggle with fertility issues. Up to half of couples &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38716407/" rel&gt;seeking treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; for them are labeled as having “unexplained infertility” by doctors—and therefore go untreated. Many of them will try IVF, which risks being unsuccessful, because the underlying cause of their infertility has not been addressed. Revolutionary though it has been, IVF does not restore a would-be mother’s body to optimal health; in fact, IVF is often a profoundly uncomfortable experience for women, not to mention an expensive one. It’s no wonder that many women with “unexplained infertility” are left feeling that mainstream medicine &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877575623000691" rel&gt;has failed them&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, subjecting them to stressful, painful interventions, while leaving them in the dark about the mysteries of their own bodies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is another way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Free Press</author><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jul 2025 10:01:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxPaTRxNkF0ZVNiVDJ4b191bTlOWE4xOXQwbVRwUWJnc0VzVXBSYlRCd3dfemx2dS05THNjTjNkTG5tTG9OdWJTaEdKVHZQSGRzSHVtMjlzajllUUhLZ3Z1Nm5uWEZDN3ZnYmdsOXZxOFd1RndqMm5Md1VWUTBFbmV5eXpidw</guid></item><item><title>以下是佛罗里达州四人死于食肉细菌后面临风险的人- NBC新闻 | Here's who's at-risk after four die from flesh-eating bacteria in Florida - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxNSTFyZGgtUHhWLWhLT1pZX2QxTmtLdEdyNlI5TmpQZnBoWHQ4NkJFdFJqNE5fdWpCaFVPdVFYbkpBUmV3X3pxMXk4MnZNTGdUdGg0SHB5VGZjOXoyQVM5QnlmTjd1dnN5X0VDYUI1b0N1bldGUDZlNTRiZi16dllReGw0aFgyOEtIbDRaa1dzOWNoUlZvTEVqb2xubXp5eXRVdmwtLdIBVkFVX3lxTFBqb2EyX05aVUJTNDhubXpDbGgxeEdVNlZYR2Y4NGota1VpSVV6QXF4c3J1UFozeGc4elQyUzk3ZmJxdXpRdHJ6TU5MY2h3ZjZLMGtSNk13?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-74b45e" class="body-graf"&gt;Four people in Florida have died this year from bacterial infections that can cause “flesh-eating” wounds, the &lt;a href="https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/vibrio-infections/vibrio-vulnificus/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;state’s health department&lt;/a&gt; reported this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bc1782" class="body-graf"&gt;The culprit, the bacteria Vibrio vulnificus, thrives in warm seawater. The deadly cases were seen in counties spread around Florida’s extensive coastline, from Bay County in the Panhandle and Hillsborough County, where Tampa is located, on the Gulf Coast, to Broward County in southeastern Florida and St. Johns County just south of Jacksonville.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c35e06" class="body-graf"&gt;Florida has seen 11 Vibrio vulnificus cases so far this year, the state’s health department says. The bacteria can get into the body through open wounds in the skin and cause the surrounding tissue to die, a condition known as necrotizing fasciitis, or flesh-eating disease, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vibrio/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. People can also get Vibrio vulnificus from eating contaminated foods, particularly raw oysters. It’s unclear how the people in Florida were infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-17648c" class="body-graf"&gt;About 1 in 5 people with a Vibrio vulnificus infection die, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f2d2fe" class="body-graf"&gt;Antarpreet Jutla, an engineering professor at the University of Florida who researches Vibrio bacteria, said Vibrio vulnificus infections are still rare, though they tend to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/hurricane-idalia-concerns-flesh-eating-bacteria-rcna102181" target="_blank"&gt;increase after hurricanes&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, Florida saw a total of 82 cases, which may have been exacerbated by the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/weather/hurricanes/hurricane-season-ends-rcna181808" target="_blank"&gt;“extremely active” hurricane season.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-a50f4b" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Vibrio vulnificus? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-810fd0" class="body-graf"&gt;Vibrio vulnificus is one of over 200 species of Vibrio bacteria, said Rita Colwell, a professor emerita of microbiology at the University of Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4ffa7d" class="body-graf"&gt;The majority of Vibrio infections aren’t harmful to humans, Jutla said. Some only affect other animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dfa96b" class="body-graf"&gt;But Vibrio bacteria do cause about 80,000 infections in people each year, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24884-vibrio-vulnificus" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. Most of those cases are gastrointestinal. Only a small handful — 100 to 200 cases — are due to Vibrio vulnificus. Other Vibrio species, including Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio alginolyticus, are often the cause of those stomach illnesses. Another type of Vibrio, Vibrio cholorae, causes the diarrheal disease cholera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d72eef" class="body-graf"&gt;Because Vibrio bacteria prefer warm water, they are typically found along the southeastern shores of the U.S., but are also found on the West Coast as well. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/environment/fear-warming-oceans-flesh-eating-bacteria-rcna75935" target="_blank"&gt;As ocean temperatures warm&lt;/a&gt;, more cases have been found further north in recent years, Jutla said, including some in &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/3-people-die-flesh-eating-bacteria-infections-new-york-connecticut-pro-rcna100364" target="_blank"&gt;New York, Connecticut and Maryland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-1021e7" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is at risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bcd450" class="body-graf"&gt;Vibrio bacteria can creep in open wounds after spending time in salty or brackish water, said Dr. Norman Beatty, an infectious disease doctor at University of Florida Health. Most cases he’s seen have been associated with spending extended time in the water, but he says that a brief exposure could be the “only thing needed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-767532" class="body-graf"&gt;Visible signs of an infection can start in just a few hours, Beatty said, and include redness, swelling and “bull’s-eye” blisters. The site will also be painful. If infection progresses, it can get into the bloodstream and cause sepsis, which can be deadly.

                Protein has taken over the packaged-snack aisles at the grocery store. But do you need extra protein in your chips and muffins?

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Protein has never gone out of style. While fat was demonized as the nutrient causing weight gain in the 1990s, followed by carbs in the 2000s, protein sat by the sidelines as the official people pleaser of the macro-nutrient world.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You need essential amino acids in the diet in order to sustain life," says Stefan Pasiakos, director of the Center for Human Performance Optimization at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Protein is needed for building and repairing muscle and tissues and helps support your immune system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Protein stepped into the spotlight in recent years as keto and other high-protein diets took off. Health and fitness influencers started to push everyone to eat more muscle-building foods in every meal (deep-fried &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdQFw-_vKpY" target="_blank"&gt;cottage cheese Doritos&lt;/a&gt; anyone?) The nutrient is so ubiquitous online that one influencer asks whether &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFWBepuNApm/?hl=en" target="_blank"&gt;protein can leave him alone for five minutes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And it has now taken over the snack food aisles, with "high-protein" or "protein-packed" labels on the front of products as diverse as sweet rolls, chips and pretzels. There's even a &lt;a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/SNICKERS-HI-PROTEIN-BAR-ORIGINAL-4CT/3988040815?" target="_blank"&gt;high-protein version&lt;/a&gt; of a Snickers bar.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Leaning into protein claims on packaging&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Of course, these claims don't always mean the food is good for you or even a good source of protein.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"You'll see chips labeled high protein," says Pasiakos, who is a former director of the National Institutes of Health's Office of Dietary Supplements. "In reality, they're probably not, but people are now trying to jump all over it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The global protein-snacks market alone is projected to grow from $50 billion in 2024 to $101 billion by 2032, according to &lt;a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/protein-snacks-market-110937" target="_blank"&gt;Fortune Business Insights&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Snack-makers often market protein front and center on their packaging without mentioning the food's sugar content, says Pasiakos.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For instance, a candy with 1 gram of protein may have a high-protein marketing claim on the front of the package and to the maker, "it may not even be a false claim because they're thinking, 'If you looked at another candy, it's not going to have a gram of protein in it,'" he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Among many examples, Smash Foods' cashew butter and blueberry jam Snack Bites, sold at Whole Foods, advertises 5g of protein, yet it has 16g of sugar, more than triple its protein amount. 365 Chewy Protein Bites aren't much better, with various flavors having about 20g of sugar to 10g of protein.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration regulates marketing claims on packaged foods, restricting manufacturers from making big, overarching health claims without proof. For instance, companies can't claim their food prevents heart attacks or cures cancer, Pasiakos says. They also &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/12/19/nx-s1-5234143/fda-healthy-food-labels-diet" target="_blank"&gt;can't use the word "healthy"&lt;/a&gt; or derivatives of the word without meeting the FDA healthy standards of providing a specific amount of a nutrient within a food group.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So saying something is "high protein" can be a way of working around the regulations while signaling to consumers that a food might be good for them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to judge? Try a little math&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So how do you determine whether a snack making protein claims is worth eating? Pasiakos offers this simple calculation to get a sense of what share of the food's total calories is derived from protein.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Take the number of grams of protein in the product and multiply it by 4 — that's the number of calories &lt;a href="https://www.nal.usda.gov/programs/fnic" target="_blank"&gt;per gram of protein&lt;/a&gt;. Now you know the calories from protein in the food. Then take the protein calories and divide by the total calories in the food. That gives you the share of calories in the food that comes from protein.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For instance, let's say a protein bar has 20 grams of protein and 200 calories. You'd multiply 20 × 4 to get 80. Then you'd divide 80 by 200 and get 40%. "Anything that was high in protein would have 30% or more of protein by calorie count," says Pasiakos.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another option would be to check the percentage of the daily value (listed as DV) of protein listed on the Nutrition Facts label on the package. Anything 20% or above can be seen as high protein, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-facts-label/daily-value-nutrition-and-supplement-facts-labels#:~:text=5%25%20DV%20or%20less%20of,per%20serving%20is%20considered%20high" target="_blank"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But even if a snack is high in protein, is it automatically healthy? Not necessarily.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Protein's important, but it's not the only nutrient we should be looking at," says Clare Parme Miller, a New York-based registered dietician for &lt;a href="https://lifewaysnutrition.com/clare-parme-miller/" target="_blank"&gt;Lifeways Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;. It's equally important to get enough of other nutrients like fiber and to avoid foods high in added sugars or highly processed ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Look for snacks with added sugars of less than 10 grams that are less processed than most protein bars," she suggests.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And, you may not need your snacks to be high protein, she notes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The federal government suggests adults get at least 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (or 0.36 per pound), which is 51 grams for a 140-pound woman who isn't pregnant or breastfeeding. Some nutrition and fitness experts recommend more, especially for those seeking to build muscle and for older people.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So when it comes to snack time, says Parme Miller, "especially if you're getting 20 to 30 grams of protein at mealtime, snacks only need to provide 10 to 15 grams."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;(The &lt;a href="https://www.nal.usda.gov/human-nutrition-and-food-safety/dri-calculator" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Department of Agriculture has a handy nutrient calculator&lt;/a&gt; that takes into consideration your age and activity level.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Whole foods snacks can pack in protein too&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's not hard to meet protein minimums with whole foods, says Parme Miller, instead of reaching for packaged snacks with protein claims.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Greek yogurt or small cups of cottage cheese will fulfill your protein requirement and also provide calcium," says Parme Miller. Add berries for a boost in fiber and antioxidants.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nuts without other added ingredients and roasted chickpeas, in single-serving sizes, provide less protein than Greek yogurt but can be paired with other items to get to 10 grams. For instance, you could add whole grain crackers to boost protein a bit and get another food group in. An ounce of cheese plus a few whole grain crackers also gives you protein and whole grains, which are high in fiber and contain calcium and several B vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Other whole grain plus protein snacks include smearing a nut butter on whole grain crackers or doing the same with hummus, says Parme Miller. Adding broccoli or another vegetable for dipping slightly ups the protein value and adds fiber and calcium.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Whatever you do, don't eat gobs and gobs of protein, even if it says high protein on the label," says Parme Miller. "Protein foods, especially ones that also contain fats, are not calorie free."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reyna Gobel, MPH, MBA, is a health writer, author and nutrition educator who created the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://courses.bestnutritionclassever.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;30-Day Precision Nutrition Challenge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Apparently, the penis can appear bigger or fuller during the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/weather"&gt;heat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;At the time, GP Dr Chun Tang, from private healthcare clinic &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pallmallmedical.co.uk/"&gt;Pall Mall Medical&lt;/a&gt;, explained what can happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“So ‘summer penis’ is a term people use to describe when a male's penis seems a bit bigger or fuller during hot weather," the doc &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/29835169/summer-penis-truth-doctor-explains-hot-weather/"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; The Sun. “It’s not an official medical thing, just something people have noticed and talked about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“The idea is that in warmer months, especially when it’s hot and humid, the heat causes your blood vessels to expand a bit, which can make things down there look a bit different.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Dr Tang explained that the penis can look larger, especially when flaccid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Some men are suffering with 'summer long balls' (Getty Stock Photo)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“Some men notice that their penis looks a little larger, especially when it’s flaccid," he added. “Because of the increased blood flow, it might feel a bit softer or more relaxed than usual.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Turns out it's not just the penis that is susceptible to changes, but the testicles can also suffer from their own summer-induced 'condition' too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;'Summer long balls' - a term coined by The Cut - refers to men experiencing an increase in ball size during the hot weather. And apparently, it's causing a lot of discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“It sucks,” an unnamed person &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.thecut.com/article/mens-testicles-bigger-summer-long-balls.html"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the publication. “I wish I could wear sluttier shorts in the summer. But I can’t do so comfortably.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;And another said: “You have to make sure no one sees you grab your crotch to rearrange if you’re in public."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Some men are struggling in the hot weather (Getty Stock Photo)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The Cut reporter E.J. Dickson explained: "A man told me something a few years ago that haunts me to this day: Every summer, his balls get bigger. Not to the extent that he has to purchase new underwear or anything, but enough to make a noticeable difference when he wears trunks or loose boxers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"... Another told me he experiences a variation on summer long balls in which sweat causes the skin from his scrotum to stick to his leg, creating what he dubs a 'bat wing' effect."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Experts have since spoken out about the phenomenon, explaining that men with enlarged veins within the scrotum could be more likely to experience 'summer long balls'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“What you’re describing as summer long balls is, I suspect, really the varicocele becoming more pronounced as a result of the elevated temperature,” said urologist and surgeon, Yaniv Larish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Last year, men were contending with 'summer penis' (Getty Stock Photo)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“When you have a varicocele, the blood is not moving around efficiently, so instead of circulating around the testicle and pulling the heat away, it’s pooling up and actually insulating the testicle at an elevated temperature.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Varicoceles impact around 15 percent of men and according &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2658802/"&gt;to research&lt;/a&gt;, can decrease fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;They can be treated with surgery, but if you are suffering this summer, doctors recommend keeping as cool as possible and wearing snug-fitting underwear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Cleveland Clinic explain: "Varicoceles can contribute to about 40% of all cases of male infertility.

Eat probiotic-rich foods daily&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fermented foods like kimchi, yogurt and sauerkraut naturally contain an abundance of probiotics— the good live bacteria that can boost your gut health, says Wilkinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Regardless of your age, try adding at least one probiotic-rich food to your diet every day to help restore microbial balance and support digestion.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-cut-back-on-ultra-processed-foods"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Cut back on ultra-processed foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Highly processed foods often contain additives, emulsifiers and excess sugar that damages your gut microbiome and increases inflammation in the gut,” warns Wilkinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As you get older and your body struggles to break down foods, it’s important to limit the amount of ultra-processed food you consume to maintain gut health. Instead, try and opt for whole, natural foods wherever possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-stay-hydrated"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Stay hydrated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Keeping ourselves hydrated is important regardless of our age—though you may find yourself going to the bathroom slightly more often as you get older!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more hydrated we are, the smoother our digestive system runs—this helps to prevent constipation, supports the lining of our intestines and keeps things running smoothly. Whether you’re in your early 20s or pushing 70, try and keep yourself hydrated by consuming lots of water throughout the day,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-4-keep-moving"&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. Keep moving&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Physical activity enhances gut motility, reduces inflammation and promotes a more diverse microbiome. Even a daily &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/forget-the-gym-this-30-minute-walking-workout-will-help-you-clock-up-6-000-steps-and-boost-your-cardio" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/forget-the-gym-this-30-minute-walking-workout-will-help-you-clock-up-6-000-steps-and-boost-your-cardio"&gt;30-minute walk&lt;/a&gt; can make a huge difference to gut function and overall wellbeing,” says Wilkinson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-5-prioritize-sleep"&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. Prioritize sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lack of sleep can have a hugely negative effect on your gut health,” Wilkinson adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can disrupt your gut flora and increase the amount of stress hormones in the body, which in turn can affect digestion. Counter this by trying to keep a regular bedtime, limit screen use before bed, and avoid caffeine in the afternoon to ensure a good night’s sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;

Rich in antioxidants and naturally occurring compounds, coffee has been associated with improved cognitive function, better metabolic health, and reduced risk of certain chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes and Parkinson’s. However, many people unknowingly develop habits that diminish these benefits. According to health.com, from drinking coffee too late in the day to using it as a meal replacement or overloading it with sugar, these mistakes can interfere with sleep, hydration, gut health, and overall wellness. Health experts weigh in on the most common coffee-drinking mistakes and how to correct them for optimal results and sustained energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5 daily &lt;keyword id="27876272" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="coffee-drinking-habits" source="keywords"&gt;coffee drinking habits&lt;/keyword&gt; that could be harming you &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Drinking coffee too late can disrupt sleep quality&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine, the primary stimulant in coffee, can linger in the bloodstream for several hours, potentially interfering with the body's natural sleep-wake cycle. Studies have shown that consuming coffee even six hours before bedtime can significantly reduce sleep duration and quality. Since restorative sleep is essential for immune function, mental clarity, and overall health, experts recommend avoiding caffeine in the late afternoon and evening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Tip: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For better sleep hygiene, stop consuming caffeinated beverages at least six hours before bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Unfiltered coffee may increase LDL cholesterol&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While French press, Turkish coffee, and espresso are popular for their bold flavor, these brewing methods produce unfiltered coffee, which contains higher levels of diterpenes—specifically kahweol and cafestol. These compounds have been shown to elevate LDL (bad) cholesterol, which increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Tip:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Choose filtered brewing methods like drip or pour-over to minimize the intake of cholesterol-raising compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Excess &lt;keyword id="27355007" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="sugar-in-coffee" source="keywords"&gt;sugar in coffee&lt;/keyword&gt; undermines its health benefits&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding large amounts of sugar, flavored syrups, or artificial creamers to coffee can turn a health-promoting beverage into a source of empty calories and added sugars. High sugar intake is linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and even mental health issues. It also disrupts the gut microbiome, which plays a vital role in immune function and digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Tip: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aim to enjoy coffee black or lightly sweetened with natural alternatives to preserve its benefits without the sugar overload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Drinking coffee immediately after waking may blunt its effectiveness&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people reach for their first cup of coffee as soon as they wake up, but doing so can interfere with the body's natural production of cortisol, a hormone that helps regulate energy levels. Drinking coffee too early may also disrupt adenosine, a neurotransmitter that helps promote restful sleep and wakefulness balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Tip: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delaying coffee intake slightly may make it feel more effective and reduce your dependence on caffeine throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Coffee should never replace a balanced meal&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although coffee can slightly suppress appetite and is often associated with weight loss, it is not a suitable substitute for a meal. Coffee lacks essential nutrients such as protein, fiber, healthy fats, and vitamins required for sustained energy, blood sugar balance, and metabolic health. Skipping meals in favor of caffeine can result in mood swings, fatigue, and nutritional deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Tip: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consume coffee alongside a balanced meal, particularly breakfast, to support metabolic function and avoid energy crashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How smarter coffee habits can improve your well-being&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee can be a powerful ally in promoting mental alertness, metabolic health, and overall wellness—if consumed correctly. Small changes in your coffee habits, such as avoiding late-day caffeine, limiting sugar, choosing filtered brewing methods, and ensuring it complements rather than replaces meals, can help you maximize its benefits without compromising your health. With expert-backed guidance, your daily cup of coffee can remain both a satisfying ritual and a health-positive habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/i-eat-a-donut-every-morning-elon-musks-surprisingly-fitness-routine-and-diet-unveiled/articleshow/122759263.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;‘I eat a donut every morning’; Elon Musk’s surprisingly fitness routine and diet unveiled&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jul 2025 05:19:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiwJBVV95cUxPTUJqOVhadzhJQ0d5SjZ4d1BscmpzZm1qVUZpUkU0aTZOdnZvRG90QkJVOVU2NnprU0dUdHRFcUxvQ1h5dlkzbDdjZ1c5eXZrYzd1cDB2bmdDbW9FYTdSbG9meTVScEgycl9sY0FBSmVLS2E5UEgtOURUZlQ5bG4zSncyeGZmSXpMVm02Zml2MHotaGNkR3VoNDNkNGR3SE1Jd1BrcXM1WkhXZWg0TWlkYXpnVDJwSWQtRDlPMC0tRFBZMG9xQjNKa0dGNmVxelI0Q3I1T2NHVTVlcjZaUHZKdllFQ0FuQ1RvbEw0eXo1ZUNrdWtMbUUxbjE1d0VjeENvSTRGbHV5V0pYWnM</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，帮助你排便的6种最佳碳水化合物- EatingWell | The 6 Best Carbs to Help You Poop, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE5hWnliSHFFMU1RRnR4RmhTTXlrMEFFWWM4d0Z6a09iRjJia1lGT0RZYWhrRGhlbTg4NFhESG9LcU50REF2eVlzRy0xOS1hRENBVGk1QmxKS2ZDNFhVRWlKeW5PRUdUdVVfNzRxa1FsSXY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

The good news is that what you eat can make a big difference.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Oats are a great source of fiber that can help promote regularity. One cup of dry oats provides about 8 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Oats have both &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962360/what-is-the-difference-between-insoluble-and-soluble-fiber-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;soluble fiber, which forms a gel-like texture&lt;/a&gt; to soften stool, and insoluble fiber, which adds bulk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  This combination helps stool pass more easily through the digestive tract.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Oats contain beta-glucan, a type of soluble fiber that produces beneficial bacteria to promote regularity,” says &lt;a href="https://ksgnutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;KaTrina Samuels-Garrison, RDN&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lentils contain a type of fiber called &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-resistant-starch-11749332" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;resistant starch that supports digestive health&lt;/a&gt; in several ways. One cup of cooked lentils provides about 16 grams of fiber, which helps add bulk to stool while promoting movement.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The resistant starch in lentils has &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291159/what-are-prebiotics/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;prebiotic benefits that feed the beneficial gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt; to help break down fiber and create short-chain fatty acids. These fatty acids help support digestion, maintain a healthy colon and keep bowel movements regular.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; An apple a day might help keep constipation away. Apples are high in pectin, a soluble fiber that acts as a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-to-help-you-poop-11757815" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;natural stool softener&lt;/a&gt;. One medium apple provides about 4 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Eating it with the skin on adds even more insoluble fiber, which helps bulk up stool and promote regularity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Apples are also high in water, which can help lead to better bowel movements,” says Samuels-Garrison. Snack on raw apples, slice them into oatmeal or pair them with nut butter for extra nutrients.

Look for breads with at least 3 grams of fiber per slice to get the most benefit. Checking the ingredient list for “100% whole wheat” as the first ingredient can also help ensure that you’re getting a true whole-grain product that’s rich in nutrients and gut-friendly fiber.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Carbs often get a bad rap, but the right ones can actually be your gut’s best friend,” Winstead says. Whole grains like whole-wheat bread also offer B vitamins and minerals that support energy and digestion.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sweet potatoes contain a mix of soluble and insoluble fiber, making them especially helpful for promoting regular bowel movements. They’re also rich in water, which can help soften stool naturally. With 8 grams of fiber per 1 cup, they’re a delicious, nutrient-dense option that supports digestion and keeps you satisfied.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Enjoy them roasted, mashed or baked. Leave the skin on for an extra fiber boost.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beans, including black beans and kidney beans, are loaded with fiber and prebiotic resistant starch to feed good gut bacteria. Just a half-cup serving can provide 7 to 8 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Beans and lentils contain resistant starches that support &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacteria,&lt;/em&gt; a bacterium which helps you digest fiber,” explains Samuels-Garrison. Start by slowly increasing your intake of beans and drink plenty of water to reduce gas and bloating.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to including these high-fiber carbs in your meals, there are other small steps you can take to help get things moving.

&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drink water: &lt;/strong&gt;Staying hydrated softens stool and helps fiber do its job effectively. A common mistake is increasing fiber intake without also increasing water intake, which results in further constipation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move your body:&lt;/strong&gt; Regular exercise can help stimulate digestion and relieve constipation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t ignore the urge:&lt;/strong&gt; Go when you feel the need. Waiting can increase the risk of constipation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage stress: &lt;/strong&gt;Stress can slow down digestion. Take a few calming breaths throughout the day to help relax the body and digestive tract.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a routine: &lt;/strong&gt;Eating meals and visiting the bathroom around the same times each day can train your digestive system to stay regular.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Carbs that are loaded with fiber can be powerful foods to support digestive health and relieve constipation, thanks to gut-friendly prebiotics and stool-promoting benefits. “Fiber-rich carbs help add bulk and softness to your stool, making it easier to go,” Winstead says. Pair these foods with plenty of fluids, movement and consistent habits to keep your gut working smoothly. If constipation continues, consider talking to a health care professional to explore other solutions.&lt;br&gt;

As of 26 June, the number of malaria cases had risen to &lt;a href="https://x.com/MoHCCZim/status/1941038980050698434" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;119,648, with 334 deaths&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Zimbabwean health ministry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The distribution of essential control methods, such as mosquito nets, was also disrupted, leaving hundreds of thousands of people exposed to mosquito bites across the country. The health ministry said in May that 1,615,000 insecticide-treated nets were being distributed but that there was a shortfall of 600,000 due to the withdrawal of US funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Itai Rusike, director of Zimbabwe’s Community Working Group on Health, said funding shortfalls were jeopardising the country’s significant gains against malaria over the past 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Sustained domestic funding is critical to keep prevention and treatment efforts on track,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“If mosquito nets and preventive medicines for pregnant women are unavailable, lives will be lost. When the supply of test kits and first-line treatments is disrupted, malaria cases and deaths will spiral.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Children under the age of five account for 14% of total malaria cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Zimbabwe has set out to eliminate malaria by 2030, in line with the ambitious &lt;a href="https://alma2030.org/about-alma/our-role/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;goal set by the African Union&lt;/a&gt;, using various strategies such as raising community awareness, preventing mosquito bites with insecticide-treated nets and spraying, as well as improving surveillance systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Henry Madzorera, a former health minister, said Zimbabwe should mobilise its own resources to bridge the funding gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We have a lot of taxes earmarked for the health sector – let us use them wisely for health promotion and disease prevention,” he said. “People must be treated early for malaria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The country should not rely on donors to do malaria-elimination activities,” Madzorera added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In 2024, &lt;a href="https://foreignassistance.gov/cd/zimbabwe/2024/disbursements/1" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;USAID disbursed $270m for health and agriculture programmes&lt;/a&gt; in Zimbabwe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="58c24f09-be9b-4a59-afcb-1705eebf214f" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;In 2024, USAID provided $270m for health and agriculture programmes in Zimbabwe, such as this dam.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: USAID&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Zimbabwe’s deputy health minister, Sleiman Kwidini, admitted the funding gap left by the US cuts had disrupted the provision of mosquito nets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We are now taking over the procurement of those nets after the US withdrew funding.

Cases in people under 50 have been on the rise for at least the past 20 years, maybe even 30. That steady climb has experts seriously concerned. According to the latest numbers from IARC, around 1.9 million people are diagnosed with it every year, and over 900,000 lose their lives to it globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Why Daycare Cancer Centres Are a Game-Changer: Expert Insights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of colon cancer in the United States is significant. In 2025, an estimated 154,270 new cases of colon cancer are expected to be diagnosed, representing about 7.6% of all new cancer cases. The incidence rate stands at approximately 37.1 new cases per 100,000 people per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To lower the risk of colon cancer, the following are science backed strategies:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Get regular screenings&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting at age 45, regular colorectal &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/colorectal-cancer/prevention/index.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;screenings &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;are one of the most effective ways to prevent colon cancer. Screenings like colonoscopies can detect precancerous polyps—tiny growths in the colon or rectum that could turn into cancer over time. Removing them early prevents cancer before it starts. If you have a family history or other risk factors, you may need to start even earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screenings save lives by catching problems before symptoms appear. Talk to your doctor about which screening method is best for you and how often you should get tested based on your risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Which step do you think helps more in preventing colon cancer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Maintain a healthy weight&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carrying extra weight, especially around the belly, can increase inflammation and affect hormone levels that may raise your risk of colorectal cancer. Obesity is a major risk factor, so maintaining a healthy body weight through balanced eating and regular exercise is essential. Even losing a small amount of weight can make a big difference. Focus on gradual, sustainable habits like cutting back on processed foods, reducing portion sizes, and staying active. Avoid crash diets or quick fixes. The goal isn’t perfection, it’s progress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Stay physically active&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days does more than just burn calories—it also lowers colon cancer risk. Physical activity helps regulate digestion, reduce inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity, and boost immune function. Regular movement also helps counteract the harmful effects of prolonged sitting, which has been linked to higher cancer risk. You don’t need to be a gym rat—brisk walking, cycling, dancing, swimming, or even gardening count. The key is consistency. Bonus: exercise also reduces your risk for heart disease and boosts mood, so it’s a win all around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Eat more plants &amp;amp; fiber&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A diet full of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, and nuts provides fiber, antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals that support colon health. Fiber keeps things moving in your digestive tract, helping to flush out potential carcinogens. It also feeds the “good” bacteria in your gut, which can reduce inflammation and support immune function. Aim for a colorful plate—greens, berries, carrots, beans, brown rice, oats. These natural, nutrient-dense foods have been linked with a lower risk of colorectal cancer. Processed snacks and sugar? Not so much. Your colon will thank you for going green and whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cut back on red &amp;amp; processed meat&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a burger now and then won’t doom you, studies consistently show that high consumption of red meat—like beef, pork, and lamb—and especially processed meats like bacon, sausage, and deli slices can increase your risk of colon cancer. These meats contain compounds that can damage the lining of your colon, especially when cooked at high temperatures. Try swapping meat for plant-based proteins like lentils, beans, tofu, or lean poultry and fish. If you do eat red meat, keep portions small and limit frequency. Save the bacon for special occasions—your gut health depends on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Limit alcohol intake&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking alcohol increases your risk of colon cancer, especially if consumed regularly and in large amounts. Alcohol can damage the cells lining your colon and lead to inflammation, which may trigger cancer development over time. To lower your risk, stick to moderate drinking: no more than one drink per day for women and two for men—or better yet, cut back further or avoid it altogether. Swap alcohol with sparkling water, herbal tea, or mocktails for a healthier routine. Your liver, colon, and energy levels will all benefit from the change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Don’t smoke&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smoking is a well-known cause of lung cancer, but it also significantly increases the risk of colorectal cancer. The harmful chemicals in tobacco travel through your bloodstream and digestive tract, damaging colon tissue and potentially leading to cancer over time. The longer you smoke, the higher the risk—but quitting at any stage brings benefits. If you smoke, get help to stop. Use nicotine patches, support groups, or talk to your doctor about quitting strategies. It’s one of the single best things you can do for your overall health—including your colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Watch how you cook meat&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grilling, frying, or broiling meat at high temperatures can produce harmful chemicals like heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which may increase &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/cooked-meats-fact-sheet" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;cancer &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;risk. You can reduce this risk by marinating meat before cooking (which can lower harmful compounds), flipping meat frequently to avoid charring, or using lower-heat cooking methods like baking or steaming. Choose lean cuts, trim visible fat, and avoid overcooking. If you love BBQ, balance it out with plenty of vegetables and fiber-rich sides. It’s not just what you eat—it’s also how you cook it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Combine healthy habits&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no magic pill for cancer prevention, but the combo of multiple healthy habits has a powerful effect. Getting screened, exercising, keeping your weight in check, eating plant-based, skipping tobacco, limiting alcohol, and cooking smart all add up. Each habit stacks your odds in your favor and helps your body stay strong. Prevention isn't about perfection—it’s about giving yourself the best possible shot at long-term health. Make small changes, stay consistent, and remember: your daily choices can protect your future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This content is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

You’re told it's generally safe aside from needing a bit more sleep, and sometimes feeling like your head’s in a fog. But now... headlines say it might increase your risk of dementia by up to 40%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you yank your prescription and panic-type in Google, let’s break down what this all means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Gabapentin?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabapentin is a medication first approved in 1993 for treating epilepsy. Soon after, its knack for reducing nerve pain—from post-shingles neuralgia to diabetic neuropathy—made it wildly popular. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s generally considered safer and less addictive than opioids. Side effects? Sure—sleepiness, dizziness, headaches, nausea. But for many, the relief from chronic pain outweighs those little annoyances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;New study: What did researchers do and find?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40639955/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;published in Regional Anesthesia &amp;amp; Pain Medicine analyzed records from 68 U.S. health systems, comparing patients with chronic low back pain. The ones who’d had six or more prescriptions of gabapentin were 29% more likely to develop dementia, and 85% more likely to experience mild cognitive impairment (MCI)—all within a decade of their first pain diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The darker stat? People with 12 or more prescriptions faced a 40% increased dementia risk and a 65% bump in MCI risk versus those with fewer prescriptions. Age mattered too. Those aged 35–64 saw more dramatic effects, with dementia risks doubling for 35–49-year-olds and MCI risk tripling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should you ditch Gabapentin?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not without having a word with your doctor. Here’s the smart play:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors might explore alternatives, such as topical therapies, antidepressants (off-label), or even non-drug therapies like mindfulness or physical therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle remains king: exercise, brain games, healthy diet—all proven to protect cognition .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What about other dementia-linked medications?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just about gabapentin.

But could it also dull cognition over time? Possibly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chronic pain itself is linked to faster memory decline. So is pain causing dementia, or is gabapentin? Hard to say.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lack of physical activity and social isolation often accompany chronic pain—and both are known dementia risk factors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So it might be a combination of factors, not just the drug itself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What should you do if you’re on Gabapentin?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a mini checklist to guide your next steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Talk to your doctor—especially if you’ve been prescribed gabapentin frequently or long-term.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask about brain monitoring: cognitive assessments every year or two could catch changes early.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Explore alternatives: viability depending on your condition—other meds or therapy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Boost lifestyle defenses: walk, chat, do puzzles, eat well. (Yep, the brain benefits from spinach and Sudoku.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Educate your support system: family and friends can help notice memory lapses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t abruptly quit: stopping suddenly could worsen pain or trigger withdrawal—the switch should be managed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabapentin has been a go-to painkiller, especially as we try to avoid opioids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research suggests a link to dementia risks, particularly with frequent/prolonged use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s not a deal-breaker—especially if you use it responsibly and under medical supervision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, this is a wake-up call: time to talk to your doctor, think critically, and monitor brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabapentin-dementia risk FAQs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does gabapentin really increase the risk of dementia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recent research suggests that long-term or frequent use of gabapentin may be associated with a higher risk of developing dementia or mild cognitive impairment. However, the study was observational, so it doesn't prove causation. It highlights the need for more research and regular cognitive monitoring in long-term users.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is most at risk from gabapentin-related cognitive issues?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study found that people aged 35 to 64, especially those who had 6 or more prescriptions over time, were at higher risk. Those with 12 or more prescriptions had up to a 40% increased risk of developing dementia compared to people who used less or none.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I stop taking gabapentin if I’m currently using it for pain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;No—do not stop taking gabapentin suddenly, especially without consulting your doctor. If you're concerned, speak with your healthcare provider to review your dosage, explore alternatives, or discuss ways to monitor your cognitive health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there safer alternatives to gabapentin for managing nerve pain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, depending on your condition. Alternatives include physical therapy, certain antidepressants, topical treatments, or other medications. Your doctor can recommend the best option based on your specific needs and health history.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I protect my brain health while managing chronic pain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides regular medical reviews, focus on brain-friendly habits: stay physically active, eat a balanced diet, manage stress, stay socially connected, and challenge your mind with puzzles, reading, or learning.

It's important that New Yorkers ensure they are immunized against measles," State Health Commissioner Dr. James McDonald said. "Protect yourself and your family against measles and make sure you are up-to-date on immunization with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine."&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All partners are collaborating with Albany Medical Center and Saratoga Hospital to investigate the case and are taking the necessary proactive steps to prevent the spread of measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Albany Medical Center Executive Vice President and Hospital General Director Dr. Jason Mouzakes said, “As the region's only academic medical center and Level 1 Trauma Center, our Emergency Department is fully prepared for serious illnesses that may present at our doors. Our team acted immediately and appropriately to minimize exposure. We are working with the Department of Health and have notified those potentially exposed, offering vaccinations. The patient arrived masked and was immediately isolated at the hospital. The Department of Health was notified, per protocol, and we are continuing to monitor the situation.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;All New Yorkers are urged to protect themselves by making sure they're up to date on their measles, mumps and rubella vaccines along with other important, lifesaving immunizations and be aware of health advisories when traveling with unvaccinated individuals, especially young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious, serious respiratory disease that causes rash and fever.

Those traveling should plan to be fully vaccinated against measles at least two weeks before departure. One dose provides 93 percent protection while two doses provide 97 percent protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who are unsure of their vaccination status should locate their vaccination records and consult their health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Babies as young as 6 months should get one dose of the MMR vaccine if they are traveling abroad. After travel, these babies should then continue to get their next two MMR vaccines on schedule for a total of three vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department issued a travel advisory on April 2, available to all health care providers, that includes specific MMR vaccine schedules based on the age of the traveler. Anyone who is not protected can get measles while traveling and can easily spread it to others when they return home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WRGB</author><pubDate>Sat, 19 Jul 2025 01:17:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxONm9wZlRvQ2UtT3ZZdVR0eVdEMUZicVhiZEpsWVBodWxucXkxcDBITFZUU19ENS1iejB6ODVYbjFRcEF2VUtjYXREZ0VxMlgxSlVvR1RzMTF1MXpBSkdQRlVqZnVHVl9zc2o1NjZFT3RIRkJRckt1ZjJjQXN6X0M3REVlemNkT1VHVjdOUkxPUjU4ZE8xYWpYMFZqUTY</guid></item><item><title>纽约州卫生部：麻疹患者本周访问了AMC的萨拉托加医院-《每日公报》 | NYSDOH: Measles patient visited Saratoga Hospital, AMC this week - The Daily Gazette</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxNMS14bmJ0MURuemhSOTlRVGJkdmpDTEdGcjh5Wl84NVV4NnhLUXdXWmdGazlGZ3ZJMzFwaS10c3JJZEVjNzJGOHFDbi1uSWkzdG5tSHNNTnZNa3NKYWdCaGVVWEFzajhTSE5DZklqTTd5WjFEcEVvR0N1TmE4ZXlqel9yZ09Id1NQTTlNRVEtbDU5UUJrekdGWkpFZ0tCby1JcktwbEVFV1BHYksxcWgtM3dVYVN6clN6?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="form-group-flex"&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;Multiple children have been treated in Wake County emergency
rooms for a rare, but painful skin condition in recent weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Holly Rund shared her five-year-old daughter Lexi was in so
much pain last weekend that it caused Lexi to scream when she was touched. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“At first I thought it was hand-foot-and-mouth, and I
noticed she had a blister,” Holly recalled. “There were two on her legs and one
on her side.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Lexi’s pain grew worse, and she said her skin became itchy. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“The one on her side, when I looked at it, that was when I
knew something wasn’t right. It was yellow and puffed out and really big,” Holly
said. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Lexi described her symptoms in three simple words: “It
really hurt.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The mother took her daughter to the WakeMed Raleigh
emergency department on Sunday to get examined. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/ritters-disease-skin-health-july-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/ritters-disease-skin-health-july-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;That’s when the Runds learned Lexi had a rare but painful
condition called staphylococcal scalding skin syndrome (SSSS), also known as
Ritter’s Disease.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Lexi was kept overnight and treated with IV fluids and antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Dr. Graham Snyder is an emergency physician who sees patients
at WakeMed Raleigh and is the medical director of the hospital system’s medical
simulation center. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The physician shared he treated a different patient with the
same condition earlier this week. It was the first time he'd seen the condition this year. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“When I walked in the room and saw a patient recently, my first
thought was ‘Oh this is impetigo,’ which is just a little thing kids get from
scratching mosquito bites,” Snyder said. “The thing that was different was the
child had redness over their entire body, and their skin hurt. Normally rashes
don’t hurt. They may itch, but if a rash hurts you have to ask yourself if
something else is going on.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/ritters-disease-skin-health-july-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/ritters-disease-skin-health-july-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Snyder explained the bacteria behind SSSS sometimes grows after
a child gets a cut, or if they have been scratching their skin a lot – like if
they have allergies or eczema.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Staphylococcus, which is just like the staph infection you’ve
always heard of, emits a toxin into the blood that goes into the skin and
damages the skin, almost like a burn,” Snyder explained. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The rash and sores may sometimes be initially misdiagnosed
with pediatricians as other conditions, like hand-foot-and-mouth disease.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“The combination of pain being everywhere in the body and sometimes
you can have a combination of fever at the same time, should kind of raise your
suspicion,” Snyder warned. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;WakeMed has seen six cases so far this year, and all of them have
been pediatric.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Snyder says the number isn’t abnormal and added that multiple
cases have been reported within the past few weeks, which is slightly unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;WRAL also reached out to Duke Health and UNC Health
regarding any potential cases this year.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Duke Health officials reported they had not seen an increase
in cases and UNC Health shared they had not seen any cases this year.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Holly said she wants to warn other parents to take their
little one’s symptoms seriously and seek medical attention to keep it from
spreading to others. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“If you see one bump and it looks like that, go in. It’s
better to be safe than sorry. There’s no such thing as overreacting,” Holly said.
&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;SSSS is contagious and can live on surfaces for 24 hours. The
condition can be serious for children, &lt;a href="https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/conditions/staphylococcus-scalded-skin-syndrome#:~:text=SSSS%20is%20not%20a%20common,their%20noses%2C%20without%20getting%20sick."&gt;but
mild cases may be resolved on their own&lt;/a&gt;, according to the National Children’s
Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (KRDO) -- Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) confirms that they've received a report of dead bats found around the Black Forest area and are looking into the issue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CPW says they got a call from a resident who said that there were a number of dead bats on or near their property. The resident said they've noticed this a few times.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;As instructed by CPW, the resident was able to put on gloves and safely place a dead bat in a bag to turn over to the agency. CPW says they will be testing that bat, as well as one other bat, at a facility in Fort Collins.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;"Bats play an important role in the ecosystem, and we have a robust bat population regionally," said a spokesperson with CPW.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CPW won't know exactly what could have killed the bats until they are tested at the lab. However, as a general rule of thumb, the agency says that people should avoid handling bats and keep pets away. If you or your pet comes into contact with a bat, you should contact the El Paso County Public Health Department or your pet's vet.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;According to CPW, bats in Colorado are susceptible to certain diseases that can be harmful, or sometimes deadly, to them. One example is &lt;a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/recreation/recreation-programs/caves/colorado"&gt;White-Nose Syndrome, a fungal disease that results in a white fungus on their bodies&lt;/a&gt;. However, this disease is likely to be deadly in the winter, rather than the summer. CPW says the disease can cause bats to come out of their caves in the middle of the day during winter months, depleting fat reserves and essentially starving to death.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Rabies, while a more extreme scenario, can be spread to bats. According to CPW, bats and skunks are the main sources of rabies in Colorado. One sign of rabies in bats is if they are exhibiting unusual behavior, like being out during the day. They might also be found alive on the ground, unable to fly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CPW says people and pets should avoid all contact with bats, especially ones found on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you find a bat on the ground, do not touch it and report the bat and its location to animal control or the health department.&lt;/p&gt;

A new monthly &lt;a href="https://www.woah.org/app/uploads/2025/07/hpai-report-72.pdf"&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; from the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH), which covers activity in June, said though poultry outbreaks have decreased, with only 15 reported for the month, new outbreaks in wild birds are on the rise, especially in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early days of H5N1 outbreaks in dairy cattle, movement of infected cattle and contaminated equipment were thought to play major roles in the spread of the virus. However, outbreaks continued to occur, despite curbs on moving dairy cows among states and stepped-up biosecurity measures on farms, raising ongoing questions and intense scientific investigations into other contributing factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fly sequence stirs new buzz&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Raj Rajnarayanan, MSc, PhD, a computational biologist with the New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine at Arkansas State University, noticed that H5N1 sequence samples from a house fly from California in October had been recently uploaded to GISAID, the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, and posted his observations on &lt;a href="https://x.com/RajlabN/status/1945958715544244693"&gt;X&lt;/a&gt;. Like the virus spreading in cattle, the virus belonged to the B3.13 subtype of the 2.3.4.4b clade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Detection of avian influenza in house flies shows these insects can mechanically move virus around farms,” Rajnarayanan wrote in a follow-up post. “No evidence they spread H5N1 to people or animals but it’s another reason to step up farm biosecurity!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Coston, a former paramedic who has been chronicling avian flu scientific developments for decades on his news blog &lt;a href="https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2025/07/h5n1-in-california-return-of-fly.html"&gt;Avian Flu Diary&lt;/a&gt;, in a &lt;a href="https://afludiary.blogspot.com/2025/07/h5n1-in-california-return-of-fly.html"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; yesterday referenced a report from as far back as 2006 from Japan that showed blow flies found in the vicinity of a poultry outbreak could carry the virus and spread it by their feet or body following contact with infected material. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While we're not talking about classically &lt;em&gt;'infected&lt;/em&gt;' flies, it seems likely that contaminated flies may be one of many contributors to the spread of the HPAI [highly pathogenic avian influenza] virus,” he wrote, also pointing to a more recent preprint study that suggested blowflies at a Japanese crane colony could acquire the virus from dead birds or from fecal material of infected birds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coston also noted that peridomestic animals such as rodents and “poultry dust” have been suggested as other contributors. “Unless and until we get a better handle on how HPAI is spreading in the wild—and among and between farms—our ability to slow or contain these outbreaks will remain limited.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;‘Milk snatching’ among routes of cow mammary gland infection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other developments, a Chinese research team that studied experimental infections involving different inoculation routes and resulting transmission in dairy cattle found that mouth-to-teat transmission may be how the H5N1 virus initially infects mammary glands. The team published its findings earlier this month in &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/nsr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nsr/nwaf262/8180392?login=false"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Science Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that virus delivered through the nose only replicates in the mouth and respiratory tracts of dairy cattle, but inoculation into the mammary gland replicates only in that mammary gland, suggesting that entry through the teat is the only way the virus can naturally infect mammary glands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because some lactating cows “steal milk” through self-nursing or mutual nursing, mouth-to-teat transmission may be the route by which H5N1 initially infects the mammary glands, the team wrote. Calves were also able to transmit the virus through nursing. Investigators noted that bovine oral tissues contain high levels of sialic acid receptors, which may facilitate viral infections through contaminated feed and water and efficient replication that can last for several days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other experiments, researchers tested two vaccines in lactating cattle, H5 inactivated vaccine and hemagglutinin-based DNA vaccine.

Prolonged sitting isn’t just bad for your heart; it could also shrink your brain. This effect cannot be compensated for, even if you work out regularly. Yes, that’s right. A recent study found that sedentary behavior is linked with neurodegeneration and cognitive decline despite engaging in physical activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study led by researchers at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and the University of Pittsburgh found that increased sedentary behavior (time spent sitting or lying down) significantly increases the risk of brain shrinkage, related to risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease, especially among older adults. The findings are published in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12070248/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Surprisingly easy ways to protect your brain and prevent stroke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Link between brain shrinkage and prolonged sitting &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is known that prolonged sitting increases the risk of chronic diseases, musculoskeletal problems, and even premature death. But this new study has found that it could also lead to cognitive decline. The researchers found that despite regular physical activity, older adults who spend more time sedentary show greater signs of cognitive decline and brain atrophy over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you believe prolonged sitting can affect brain health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also suggests that sedentary behaviour may be an independent risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, a condition that already affects millions of people across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at 404 adults aged 50 and older for over a seven-year period to undestand the effects of sedentary behavior on cognitive health. The participants were asked to wear activity-monitoring devices for one week to track how much time they spent sitting or lying down. Their sedentary time was then related to their cognitive performance and brain scans captured over a seven-year follow-up period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that people who spent more time sedentary were more likely to experience cognitive decline and neurodegenerative changes, regardless of how much they exercised. This was prominent in participants who carried the APOE-e4 allele, a genetic risk factor for &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/alzheimers-disease-causes-early-symptoms-and-11-lifestyle-changes-that-could-help-prevent-it/articleshow/122627015.cms" rel="noopener" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. This stresses that reducing sedentary time may be especially important for older adults who are at increased genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reducing your risk for Alzheimer’s disease is not just about working out once a day. Minimizing the time spent sitting, even if you do exercise daily, reduces the likelihood of developing Alzheimer’s disease,” lead author Marissa Gogniat, PhD, assistant professor of Neurology at Pitt and former postdoctoral fellow at the Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer’s Center, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Sitting for prolonged hours at work: Beware of these side affects!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is critical to study lifestyle choices and the impact they have on brain health as we age. Our study showed that reducing sitting time could be a promising strategy for preventing neurodegeneration and subsequent cognitive decline. This research highlights the importance of reducing sitting time, particularly among aging adults at increased genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease. It is critical to our brain health to take breaks from sitting throughout the day and move around to increase our active time,” co-author Angela Jefferson, PhD, professor of Neurology and founding director of the Vanderbilt Memory and Alzheimer’s Center at VUMC, added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogJBVV95cUxPc2R2Q1RYNERKYkFnVk1tc2Z0WjhuZ0ZXejFaSnZYREpicEpMS3BSb0twWXlJYVh3eFRMdWFXYXBMaXR4TGk1Nk9vVGpSUWJSV0VoWEMteVVWa1VCUUlLVVg4Sjh3UUUydV9TNm5GLUdlU0ltOFgxc2tXQXliWWdkMUxNeWZlNF9hbHBjNW5wQlhCUlpHVG1TdmZIaV90WXNkTUlLYW0zM05HS1BNcFB5QlMzVHdKeDVQQ2ZrZFA0SUptRzkzZ09uWHFKa1lIaFYyU3JCOXlGdFRBS0h3SThNYlhBdUVDdFRJdlMwQWpaNDFDNTBaWmhRYTVRQm9mOV9PVXlCU3h0SFVELVJ6azVfN2Jfb0VBLUJ6Zkx6b0JMdFlSUQ</guid></item><item><title>人们正在分享他们最大的“等等，什么？” ”关于女性健康的启示- BuzzFeed | People Are Sharing Their Biggest “Wait, What?” Revelations About Women’s Health - BuzzFeed</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5MMkdMWHlzdURZR2hnNWlGSlB4T09QcGt1YU5tcUJQUmZ0eklJdm5jNldvZkt3Z05WeWJJN3RWOTVwZC1Qbk9kSklxek1SSEhyZVZIUW9xcEJoSkZ5dVhBQ2g3N2t6UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="subbuzz buzz-width--standard__subbuzz buzz-type--list__subbuzz subbuzz-text

Bray had become an advocate for medically assisted euthanasia, saying that had a bill been in place, it would have saved her family from suffering as they watched her

legalize the procedure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As per &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Reuters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the bill “now proceeds to Britain’s upper chamber, the House of Lords, where it will undergo months of scrutiny.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;VSED is not the same as medically assisted euthanasia&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p

U.K. said was important. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;During an interview with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bored Panda&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Aly Dickinson, who runs the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;‘Living well and dying well South West’ group, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;explained that “VSED is a legal, self-directed decision to stop eating and drinking, leading to a natural d*ath,” and that it doesn’t involve “medical professionals actively ending life.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dickinson, an end of life doula in the U.K., said with VSED the only thing medical professionals provide is comfort and care.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She explained that planning is key when it comes to the decision to participate in VSED.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Things like: “choosing the place of d*ath (typically at home, or in a hospice if the hospice is willing to support VSED, “ as well as writing an end of life plan that includes a statement of Advance Refused Treatment. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block"

data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dickinson said that when it comes to who should consider VSED, there are two main groups of people: “Those experiencing unacceptable suffering, or those seeking to pre-empt the final stage of d*ing, in order to avoid future suffering or a loss of dignity.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dickinson said VSED could also be suitable for those “diagnosed with early-stage dementia who retain mental capacity and wish to avoid a prolonged decline.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other possible candidates include people “living with a progressive terminal illness who have decision-making capacity,” or those “facing significant loss of independence due to frailty and chronic health issues, but who still have mental capacity.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But Dickinson stressed that more needs to be done to educate the public about VSED. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Stories like Emma Bray’s—shared so generously—helps bring much-needed visibility to this deeply personal choice,” she told Bored Panda.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Canada, instances of misusing MAiD were investigated by the UN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media"

the Netherlands and Switzerland as other countries where the service is permitted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Canada, the option is called MAiD, which stands for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Medical Assistance in D*ing, and is performed by a qualified medical practitioner “to provide a person with assistance to end their life, provided they meet specific eligibility criteria.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The procedure became legal in 2016 and has been a hot button issue in the country ever since, with some people saying it’s administered too flippantly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="3-687961db3e14d__700"

assistance in d*ing due to unmet needs, which was a systemic failure of the State party.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;b&gt;An ironic twist in the case of the Sarco pod proponent who was being

data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another case about medically assisted euthanasia that has been grabbing headlines revolves around the Sarco pod, a coffin-like device which fills with nitrogen to bring an end of life to users.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The first instance of someone using the device was last September in the forests of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Schaffhausen, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Switzerland, when an American woman who was reportedly terminally ill chose &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/euthanasia-pod-woman-switzerland-investigation-strangulation-marks/" class=" staff-link"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sarco&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to end her life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although medically assisted euthanasia is legal in Switzerland, the Sarco pod is not, partly due to the fact that the “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;use of nitrogen in the capsule also contravened with the Chemicals Act.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The only person to witness the woman using the pod was 47-year-old Dr. Florian Willet, the co-president and founder of The Last Resort, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;an assisted euthanasia organization that promotes the pod.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container

He was never charged, and was later cleared and released.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the trauma of being detained and suspected of strangulation led to an ironic twist in the story, with Willet taking his own life by assisted euthanasia in early June of this year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4grlqv76pno" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;the pod’s inventor, Philip Nitschke, said that his friend Florian Willet had endured too much psychological trauma. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“In the final months of his life, Dr. Florian Willet shouldered more than any man should,” Nitschke told the BBC, saying that Willet’s arrest had left him “broken.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The BBC says Willet used medically assisted euthanasia administered in Germany.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are six countries in Europe with some form of legalized assisted euthanasia including the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain, and starting later this year, Austria.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Netizens remain divided over the topic of medically assisted euthanasia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_1" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_2" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_3" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_4" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Bored Panda</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 18:14:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxOVG8zUnd2UlIyVXlhU29uZmhjdEY0Z2lZYTFXTHRkejZWRmI0Nl9mRlB3VXE5TVRuSkJrdlB0TktWTlhvdlRteDQxaUx6SHRHRmd0QTg0VDFKaHVfaVlpX1JvOFRuZllfLWNzOHFOekVEZlBsM3Q5c2cyQ3BhUng4NjJCU3N3d00tdlhINjlCYUUtOW8tZ29ENjNIWFdXVEVQV1ZzVkhBZUNuX05ubEMtSWZNcjBLVmFoeWc</guid></item><item><title>癫痫患者威胁对特立尼达和多巴哥Arima医院采取法律行动 | Epileptic patient threatens legal action against Arima Hospital - Trinidad and Tobago Newsday</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxQaFZZUVo1d28yeG1aaVlDMkRVTVdfQnNsMUkwN1FqNGN0VXFnUGZqak45ZjhDTmtDLUJLanMtUGRwSlA3VmlqcjVEbkFzSmxuaEpOa3pkR1pELUR0QllxS2dJa3BLcUNndF9yVWpkangwM2dfdXNLbkNfR2pvRXpaZ3ZLV0NaSXhJUjgxZC0zNFh6VHhIcDN0NGVRZ2todw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="article-content"&gt;

&lt;figure id="article-featured-image" class="article-featured-image"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/14094834-1024x683.jpg" alt="Arima General Hospital "&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Arima General Hospital &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shaquille Edwards, a 30-year-old father of one, is considering legal action after what he describes as medical negligence at the Arima District Hospital which left him with limited use of his left hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past five years, Edwards has been living with epilepsy, enduring increasingly frequent seizures, from every three months to nearly every month. On June 21, he was taken to the Arima Hospital during a seizure episode and was later transferred to the Mt Hope Hospital on June 23.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Edwards, while he was in the throes of a seizure, trainee nurses at Arima attempted to insert an IV line, allegedly causing severe trauma to his wrist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four days later, he was finally treated for the injury. When Newsday visited him at his Arima home on July 16. His left wrist was visibly bandaged and swollen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to Edwards' claims, Health Minister Lackram Bodoe, in a brief WhatsApp message on July 17, said, "The ministry has asked the relevant regional health authority to investigate."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239531467-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newsday also spoke to the CEO of the North Central Regional Health Authority Davlin Thomas, the same day, who was not aware of the claim but confirmed an investigation has been ordered.&lt;br&gt;
Recalling the day of the incident, Edwards said, "Honestly, it was all a blur. I was having a seizure when I got there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he was discharged, the hand was swollen, numb, and painful. Later, medical staff told Edwards it was an IV burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I can't move my hand as before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwards, who operates a fruit stall to support himself and his daughter, says it has become difficult to pick fruit and do other basic chores as well as play with his daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This hand is my livelihood. Without it, I can’t lift or move produce. It's not just painful – it’s taken away part of my income."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His mother, Lesley-Ann Mark, who was with him during the hospital visit, shared her concern. She and the family had visited the hospital many times before and when they got there, she suggested to staff they should put in the IV before the seizure got worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they waited, and she alleges when it did get worse, trainee nurses were allowed to insert the IV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They took him to the back, and I didn’t know what happened after that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark said they had initially been hesitant to speak out, fearing victimisation during future visits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239585826-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve had good experiences with some staff, don’t get me wrong,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But people come to the hospital already in pain and distress. A little more empathy would go a long way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwards says his experience reflects deeper systemic issues in the healthcare system. Despite being enrolled in the epileptic clinic, he claims he has never been seen by a specialist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve asked for a proper assessment for years. They keep postponing appointments, and there’s no follow-up care after I’m discharged. They just give instructions and send you off.”&lt;br&gt;
Medication availability has also been inconsistent, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They switch my epilepsy meds all the time, first Epilim, then something else, and then something new again. It feels like I’m being experimented on. And every time they change it, my body reacts. Sometimes I end up right back in the hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photos shared with Newsday show swelling and discolouration in his left hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwards said the injury was only treated properly weeks later by a doctor who acted immediately after seeing the condition of the wound. “She didn’t even wait for wound care day, she just dressed it right away. That’s how bad it was.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also alleged despite being told he would be admitted for observation, he was removed from the ward and placed back in the emergency area to sit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We didn’t choose to leave. They just didn’t keep me. And now I’m left with the aftermath.”&lt;br&gt;
Edwards says his family is now seriously exploring legal options. “It’s not just about my hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239666137-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s about years of poor treatment, neglect, and being ignored. All we’ve asked for is decent care and a chance to heal properly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He says he is prepared to share all medical documentation, photos, and evidence to support his case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re not trying to start trouble. We just want justice, and a system that listens and cares.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;

It found evidence that an infant’s birth sex is associated with maternal age and specific genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GCXW6DS4Y5CGZC4XDO6WXSWIZA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The findings challenge assumptions that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/16/two-sexes-trump-executive-order-gender-science/" target="_blank"&gt;birth sex&lt;/a&gt; is random. They mirror the results of similar studies in Europe that have also found that birth sex does not follow a simple 50-50 distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BA7QPHWAANAK3JLIYNVXNYADVA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Scientists have long documented a global imbalance in which &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2015/08/19/see-where-women-outnumber-men-around-the-world-and-why/" target="_blank"&gt;slightly more boys&lt;/a&gt; are born than girls.

Chan School of Public Health analyzed data from more than 146,000 pregnancies from 58,000 nurses in the United States between 1956 and 2015. They found that some families were more likely to have children of the same sex than would be expected if each baby had an equal chance of being a boy or a girl. Moms with three or more kids were more likely to have all boys or all girls than expected by chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="QX7MUMBMLZHVNP3IIQ23LZVV3M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study suggests that sex at birth follows a weighted probability and that biological influences may sway the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/its-a-boy-its-a-girl-for-some-parents-learning-their-babys-sex-is-a-disappointment/2018/12/12/8aef32c0-f8be-11e8-8d64-4e79db33382f_story.html" target="_blank"&gt;sex of the child&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2G7Y4RPIVBBJXBR6Y5T452CTKI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“If you’ve had two girls or three girls and you’re trying for a boy, you should know your odds are not 50-50,” said Jorge Chavarro, the study’s senior author. “You’re more likely than not to have another girl.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AUN7PYD2PREOPB4NNYL4YIE57I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers estimated that families with three girls had a 58 percent chance of having another girl, while families with three boys had a 61 percent chance of having a fourth boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EJLGIG7YVRAZ7EFCYO262C3ZKU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Maternal age is a key factor. Women who started having children after age 28 were slightly more likely to have only boys or only girls. Chavarro said this could reflect age-related biological changes that influence the survival of the Y chromosome carried by boys, such as increased vaginal acidity. Paternal factors could also play a role because maternal and paternal ages are often closely linked. But the study did not include data on fathers, which was noted as a limitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MGJUNFE4ZBEJ7HFO5V7QXZAITE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Researchers also identified two genes associated with giving birth to only boys or only girls. “We don’t know why these genes would be associated with sex at birth, but they are, and that opens up new questions,” Chavarro, a professor of nutrition and epidemiology, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TOF22PWULVH4FIIDPNUHH4B64E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Iain Mathieson, a professor of genetics at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine who was not involved in the study, said the genetic associations should be viewed cautiously. He said the study’s genetic analysis was based on a relatively small sample and may be influenced by other factors, making the results more speculative until confirmed by further research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BZUIS64PMJGUBDARJFDY76WFTI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I don’t find the genetic factors identified here particularly convincing,” Mathieson said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4ZRFJORWN5H2POSUCWTZ6DQFQ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The researchers also found that parents were more likely to have one boy and one girl than would be expected by chance, a pattern they believe reflects a tendency to stop having children once both sexes are represented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YX6XXSCPEJEDVHLZBCOX5KLJWI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;To reduce bias from such family planning decisions, they analyzed data after removing each woman’s final child. They also excluded women who had experienced miscarriages or stillbirths to test whether pregnancy loss changed the results. They still found the same pattern: The odds of birth sex did not follow mere chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EWJJ65PXBJFBBCJ53DZSX5AH6A" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The study suggests it may not have been so improbable for the fictional parents in the TV sitcom “Malcolm in the Middle” to have five sons or for the Bennet family in “Pride and Prejudice” to have five daughters. Even in history, patterns like this have drawn attention. King Louis VII of France, for example, remarried after his first two wives each gave birth to daughters, depriving him of a male heir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2DO6FWXSB5ABBAZ53UXEW53YCQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Chavarro said it might take years to fully understand why some families consistently have children of one sex, but this research is an important place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NMMQB2EFAZG3LDKZE5PMHHARSI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;His team said future studies should explore how lifestyle, nutrition and exposure to environmental chemicals might affect these patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UKJJADTPKNB4JMPZRGGMDLUACE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Certain factors such as race, natural hair color, blood type, body mass index and height were not associated with having children of only one sex. But the study sample was 95 percent White and made up entirely of nurses, a group that may have different occupational exposures or health patterns compared with the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NURIM5QGI5B45FJ2UD2PEQUIIU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;David A. Haig, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University who was not involved in the study, said it offers evidence that the probability of a baby’s sex varies by family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CTF3VAYQ6JGWBHPQNVESLKJGWM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Different families are flipping different coins with different biases,” Haig said. “It speaks to something very intuitive and personal, even if the underlying biology is complex.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 18:02:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxOaUIzSjRCWDVobFlMNHkzRWE1N1hQQXo4TmFROFpVWXpIajc4RXFENGlVUER4WnlCN0w1WHdka05OVWx0Z2g3WXNxZXM4OHdZdVppZnEweHFzUzJtSXdLY3EwT0hOVWxMaUFHUDd1UE1hS1F6U3ZSc1dXeEowRm1Hbw</guid></item><item><title>狗在症状开始前几年通过嗅觉检测到帕金森氏症- NewsNation | Dogs detect Parkinson’s by smell, years before symptoms start - NewsNation</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE94VEg5dG1xQ1RZaUpfeG54Z3NfekpXNXVXQXdValh6MEkzR055WTVyTnZwNkMxaks4Y3NveFFrREFyVHp4ck82bEI3dDFTazN3MFNLakFtVkc1Y29NXzFwTk9PYTFrRVlNNUZNdHVvN2NjdElGN0kyd0QyM0hLTlnSAYQBQVVfeXFMTm1zeWhwWGFvTGowdTcwbGpmQkdMNDBvejNLNmlVRVRpUGkyZTFiODE3TmhlY1lUXzIwbFprcU15Uk1VOGs1Yy1RdXBQeXpTSHVEWVUyUS1yYWdHblJNa1AxRGIwcU4wSkRleVpLYWF6d09fYjVNMXRxdTZ4WGFtSkl0V2J6?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ketogenic diet is a very low-carb, high-fat diet often used for weight loss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This study suggests the keto diet may increase the risk of all cancers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Following an anti-inflammatory diet may help reduce the risk of cancer by lowering inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Heart disease still holds the top spot for causes of death in the U.S., but cancer isn’t far behind, with each condition claiming the lives of over 600,000 Americans every year.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And while researchers are more certain about how to prevent heart disease through lifestyle changes, cancer remains a bit more elusive. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Scientists are continually searching for ways to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cancer-and-how-diet-and-lifestyle-choices-lower-the-risk-8777651" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prevent cancer&lt;/a&gt; and increase survival rates for those with the disease. Researchers from China analyzed data from a long-running U.S. survey called the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) collected between 2001 and 2018. They wanted to know what association, if any, exists between a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/289764/should-you-follow-the-ketogenic-diet/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;ketogenic diet&lt;/a&gt; and cancer. They published their findings in &lt;em&gt;Nutrition and Cancer&lt;/em&gt;—let’s break down what they found.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For this analysis, almost 44,000 participants from the NHANES met the researchers’ criteria. The participants were fairly evenly split between genders, but did skew slightly more female. Participants were at least 20 years of age. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; All the data were self-reported, including history of cancer, dietary information and demographics. To determine if a participant had a history of cancer, they answered yes or no to the question, “Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that you had cancer or a malignancy of any kind?” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dietary intake was calculated using the average of two 24-hour dietary recalls, which researchers used to calculate each participant’s dietary ketogenic ratio (DKR). The DKR is a calculation that indicates the likelihood of someone entering ketosis based on their macronutrient ratio. Ketosis occurs when carbohydrates, the body’s preferred source of energy, are not available. In this case, the body turns to fat as an energy source, and then the liver converts fat into ketone bodies, which can also be used as an energy source. Based on their DKRs, participants were placed into one of four quartiles, with Q4 having the highest DKRs and Q1 having the lowest. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Demographics that would be adjusted for during statistical analyses included age, sex, ethnicity, income and education levels, marital status, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/could-the-body-roundness-index-replace-bmi-8658684" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;BMI&lt;/a&gt;, smoking status and medical history. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Researchers found that as DKR increased, so did the risk of cancer. But not just one or two types of cancer—all cancers. In other words, they found a significant association between the keto diet and the risk of developing cancer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While these study authors note that there are likely some short-term benefits of a keto diet, the long-term risks may outweigh the benefits. Why keto may raise cancer risk needs to be explored further, but researchers provide a few possible explanations. First, they note that ketones have been implicated in increasing oxidative stress, causing cellular damage, which increases the risk of developing cancer. They also point out that while cancer cells typically prefer to use glucose as an energy source, research suggests that some cancer cells can utilize ketones as an alternative energy source to survive and proliferate. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to these findings, these researchers also found that as the degree of ketosis increased, there was a notable decline in the antioxidant properties of vitamins A, C, and E, as well as trace elements such as manganese, zinc, and selenium. This aligns with numerous studies that have consistently shown deficiencies in antioxidant vitamins and trace elements can substantially increase the risk of all cancers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One significant limitation of this study is that participants’ ketosis levels were not directly measured with bloodwork. Also, information was all self-reported, which leaves room for error and bias. This includes cancer diagnoses, which might have been more accurate had they used participants’ medical records. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While a ketogenic diet does have some legitimate medical uses—like reducing seizures in children with epilepsy—beyond that, it’s mainly used to lose weight.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The problem is following it long-term—let’s face it, one can only eat so much cheese and bacon. And while all foods can fit into a healthy eating pattern, it’s important to eat a variety of foods to ensure your body gets the nutrients it needs. Though this study can’t say that a keto diet causes cancer, based on this data, there appears to be a strong connection between the two, and more research should be done. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since we know there’s also a correlation between chronic inflammation and cancer, eating an &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-an-anti-inflammatory-diet-8764103" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory diet&lt;/a&gt; may help reduce cancer risk. An anti-inflammatory diet focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains and healthy fats. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides eating a varied, balanced diet and maintaining a healthy weight, the American Cancer Society recommends engaging in regular physical activity, managing your stressors, getting plenty of quality sleep, avoiding or limiting alcohol and not smoking to help lower your cancer risk.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study suggests a connection between the ketogenic diet and cancer risk. While keto may help you lose weight, the risks may outweigh the benefits. If you feel better reducing carbs, there are healthier and more moderate ways to do so that don’t go to keto extremes. To get started, choose from our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7885079/30-minute-low-carb-high-protein-dinner-recipes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;low-carb, high-protein dinners&lt;/a&gt; that come together in just 30 minutes or our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291575/high-protein-low-carb-breakfasts-to-help-you-lose-weight/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high-protein, low-carb breakfasts&lt;/a&gt; to help you lose weight. If cancer prevention is top of mind, taking a holistic approach may not only help prevent cancer but also other diseases, including heart disease and diabetes. Include plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, lean proteins and healthy fats in your diet. In addition, move your body often, deal with what’s stressing you out, get enough quality sleep and spend time with loved ones.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EatingWell</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 17:27:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTE15RTQ3RlFCV2NFdjkweWhLN2FhSHJsV1UxS3d4V0J3NWJKenRjUFNRcVJSUTVJT216eWpydEExYzB5N2lhNkZNMmZjeXBKSGtxRVRJZFh4U0h0VU1sU0dXMldVX3YyQmViRFY2NjVocFA1NEQtUU53MTZsLVVKQQ</guid></item><item><title>特朗普政府浪费了近80万非洲疫苗：报告- Ars Technica | Trump admin squanders nearly 800,000 vaccines meant for Africa: Report - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxNZDdHck1ZNS1qamIwaUVzTDNrQ3p5bllFWFVGdjlUWmduWGU5UXhUQnVXeEdJdDAyRWlhWG5VSU9pZ2l1b0lHRFJ6SFlMM3lmOW44WkQ0c1ZPemdRbFJKSGxJampIeDR3MFZWazhoaHU0ZUI0aXBjTUZfdFo4NE5pa2RXdTVISkJBRFB6VTdoYzBLQ0xnbURJTWoyMUdMczBBU21SODk2VFNWWmhF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;Nearly 800,000 doses of mpox vaccine pledged to African countries working to stamp out devastating outbreaks are headed for the waste bin because they weren't shipped in time, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/07/17/us-has-wasted-hundreds-of-thousands-of-vaccines-meant-for-africa-health-officials-there-say-00460290?utm_campaign=KHN:+First+Edition&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz--eszRHhuI8X2faI-mZVE2luzzBgtK1oFhRnCmThGQYTOQfpxJ6mH-8hqkNJJl3U2D6dRENrJ8VXScM47-IJLTksbKauA&amp;amp;_hsmi=371897914&amp;amp;utm_content=371897914&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;according to reporting by Politico&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nearly 800,000 doses were part of a donation promised under the Biden administration, which was meant to deliver more than 1 million doses. Overall, the US, the European Union, and Japan pledged to collectively provide 5 million doses to nearly a dozen African countries. The US has only sent 91,000 doses so far, and only 220,000 currently still have enough shelf life to make it. The rest are expiring within six months, making them ineligible for shipping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For a vaccine to be shipped to a country, we need a minimum of six months before expiration to ensure that the vaccine can arrive in good condition and also allow the country to implement the vaccination," Yap Boum, an Africa CDC deputy incident manager, told Politico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politico linked the vaccines' lack of timely shipment to the Trump administration's brutal cuts to foreign aid programs as well as the annihilation of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which administered those aid programs.&lt;/p&gt;

So I’ve never been super into her, until the most recent episode of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/articles/just-season-3-starts-twist-124527827.html" data-ylk="slk:And Just Like That;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;And Just Like That&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. In season 3, episode 8, she has an unexpected attack of vertigo, an illness that’s played for laughs but is no joke, evidenced by the polarized comments about it online. As a vertigo alum myself, I've done a deep dive into the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Near the top of the episode, Charlotte is at her gallery, assembling a mattress installation clearly inspired by Tracy Emin’s seminal work &lt;em&gt;My Bed&lt;/em&gt;, when she bends over and moans softly:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Kai, may I have your hand? I think my vertigo is back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I didn’t think vertigo is real?” the gallery worker responds. “You know, like Epstein-Barr.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Oh, it’s a real thing,” Charlotte nods, woozily. “I had it last year, I had to take to my bed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Charlotte’s condition subsides, then recurs during a long set piece at the gallery, in which Charlotte pratfalls while rushing across the room. Again, when Charlotte explains that she fell due to vertigo, another character looks her dismissively and says “Is that even a real thing?” Later that same evening, Charlotte is shown entering her home alone, still bent over from the condition, trying to talk to Lisa on her phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Craig Blankenhorn/HBO Max&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Granted, vertigo isn’t as serious as Charlotte’s husband’s prostate cancer or Miranda’s alcoholism, but online banter calls out the show for its misinformation and insensitivity. In &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/and-just-like-that-recap-season-3-episode-8-happily-ever-after.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Vulture’s comment section;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Vulture’s comment section&lt;/a&gt;, for example, Mediaqueen1985 says she has vertigo, then criticizes the depiction: “Ugh. More Charlotte as Lucy Ricardo but with vertigo as an excuse. Vertigo usually involves heights, so WTH?” Next, an ear-nose and throat specialist writes “vertigo isn’t a fear of heights, but a room-spinning sensation. Charlotte likely had BPPV, although the depiction was a little…off.” Johnandtara chimes in: “Nurse here—and I have a few friends in menopause experiencing vertigo, so I think they are throwing it into the mix as a women of a certain age thing.” And finally Nnfowlds opines: “They sent Charlotte home on her own in a vertigo state? Goofy and irritating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Reality check—according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/21769-vertigo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cleveland Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, “vertigo causes dizziness and makes you feel like you’re spinning when you’re not. It most commonly occurs when there’s an issue with your inner ear. But you can also develop it if you have a condition affecting your brain, like a tumor or stroke. Treatments vary and can include medication, repositioning maneuvers or surgery.” It may or may not involve heights. There are two main types, peripheral and central; peripheral is the common sort. A decade-long &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4110114/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of nearly 1,000 women showed that one type of peripheral, BBPV (Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo), is increasingly common in perimenopausal women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Watching the show, I was perplexed by the lack of sympathy given to Charlotte when she's incapacitated, since I have had stress-induced bouts of the condition. Initially, I woke up with the room spinning so profoundly, alone and frightened, that I speed-dialed a friend to come take me to the emergency room. (My condition was diagnosed and I was given anti-nausea medication.) After subsequent attacks, an ENT taught me the Epley Maneuver, a head movement exercise designed to reposition the ear crystals that cause BBPV. It’s a recurring condition for me, in the manner of commenter Itcouldbeworse: “I had it for months, but only when I got up from bed too quickly (luckily.) The room would spin. Even after it stopped happening, I got up very slowly for a long while, in case it had come back. (The first time it had happened, there was no warning.)”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Here's the rub: Never once did anyone suggest that I might be fantasizing my illness, or doubting that the condition even exists. Nor would anyone have sent me home, unaccompanied, if I couldn’t walk straight. Charlotte deserves better—the poor woman is just regaining her footing, so to speak. She's just been through a recent major health scare with her husband, a massive career responsibility and caretaking a heartbroken daughter and teetotaling friend!

These factors damage the cells that keep your cornea clear, and they don’t grow back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Specifically, the team found that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine caused a patient's cornea to go from 528 to 542 micrometers in thickness, or roughly 0.0208 inches to 0.0213 inches. This is a roughly two-percent increase in micrometers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A slightly thicker cornea isn't automatically harmful. The cornea can thicken temporarily due to inflammation, fluid buildup, or stress on the endothelium from minor illnesses or injuries to the eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If it stays too thick for months or years, however, it could make the cornea less clear, potentially affecting vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team did not recommend against vaccination and will still need to conduct long-term testing on patients to see if these changes continue to appear months and years after taking the shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (pictured) has also been tied to rare inflammatory heart conditions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average number of endothelial cells, which keep the cornea clear by pumping out excess fluid, dropped from 2,597 to 2,378 cells per square millimeter in the study, a loss of about eight percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Normal endothelial cell counts range from 2,000 to 3,000 cells per square millimeter in healthy adults, so 2,378 is still within a safe range for most people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, for someone with a low cell count to start with, due to a previous eye surgery, infection, or disease, this loss could be riskier for their vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers also discovered that these cells became less uniform after the vaccination, with their coefficient of variation - each cell's difference in size - increasing from 39 to 42.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When cells die, nearby cells stretch to fill the gaps, leading to bigger differences in size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could mean the endothelium is less healthy. If this trend continued for years, it could affect the cornea’s clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;After vaccination, the study found fewer cells kept their healthy six-sided shape, with the total dropping from 50 to 48 percent of the cells in the eye.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Healthy endothelial cells are usually shaped like hexagons, which allows them to fit together tightly, like a honeycomb.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although the two-percent drop was not a direct sign of damage, it suggested to the team that the cells might be reacting to some sort of stress over those two months to three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers said their results also showed evidence that the changes had a high likelihood of being directly linked to taking the vaccine, meaning it wasn't just a random anomaly in the testing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;If the signs of stress and inflammation drop off shortly after receiving the Pfizer shot, the impact of these minor changes would not be overly harmful. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A woman undergoes an eye exam. Scientists have found multiple signs of stress in the eye after taking the Pfizer COVID-19 shot (Stock Image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;To find these results, the team studied 128 eyes, 64 pairs in total, before each person received their COVID vaccinations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They followed up with the group approximately 75 days after they got their second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The team used a machine called Sirius corneal topography to measure the corneas' thickness and shape, and another device, the Tomey EM-4000 specular microscope, to take detailed pictures of the endothelial cells to check their number, size and shape.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Each participant also took a full eye exam, including tests for vision sharpness, eye pressure and scans of the eye’s front and back parts to ensure overall eye health.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;By comparing the measurements taken before vaccination to those after, the researchers could see if the Pfizer vaccine was influencing the health of the eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The new data on potentially harmful side-effects linked to Pfizer's COVID vaccine added to a growing list of concerns the Trump Administration has highlighted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In May, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) forced Pfizer and Moderna to use &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14739333/trump-fda-covid-vaccine-pfizer-moderna-heart-damage.html"&gt;expanded warning labels&lt;/a&gt; about the risks of heart damage tied to COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The shots previously included warning labels about the rare chance of patients suffering myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis, inflammation of the sac-like lining surrounding the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new labels expanded that warning to certain age groups, particularly men between the ages of 16 and 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found that this seemingly healthy group appeared to be at the highest risk of the rare complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Once a week, the group dresses in neon leggings and acid-washed denim to “&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/power-walking-exercise-rcna19052" target="_blank"&gt;power walk&lt;/a&gt;” a 3.5-loop around the Lloyd Center in Portland. While the point is fitness, mall walkers love the lively chatter, ample rest stations and &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/dietitian-tip-carbs-protein-muscle-recovery-rcna207356" target="_blank"&gt;post-workout snacks&lt;/a&gt;, like Auntie Anne’s Pretzels and bubble tea.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-11ce8c" class="body-graf"&gt;Catwood admits she used to giggle at mall walkers when she worked in a mall. Now, she admires them — along with the electrifying fashion that enriched the 1980s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a42c0b" class="body-graf"&gt;As a self-professed “female Richards Simmons,” Catwood leads the pack wearing her blonde ponytail in a scrunchie, metallic fuchsia lipstick, a bright tracksuit and a fanny pack. Bringing up the caboose is Catwood’s sister Melissa Dickerson, who carries speakers blasting music by Paula Abdul, C+C Music Factory and Prince. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-daf4b5"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-06-9c43ca.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-06-9c43ca.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-06-9c43ca.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-06-9c43ca.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-06-9c43ca.jpg" alt="Krista Catwood leads a 1980s-inspired weekly walking group called “Food Court 5000.”"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Krista Catwood leads a 1980s-inspired weekly walking group called “Food Court 5000.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Amoxtli Reyes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-316475" class="body-heading"&gt;The Unique Benefits of Mall Walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-77a1b6" class="body-graf"&gt;The benefits of a walking routine are well documented. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d343a6" class="body-graf"&gt;“Walking is a low-impact exercise that offers a wide range of benefits for people of all ages and fitness levels,” Stephanie Mansour, a certified personal trainer and &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/fitness" target="_blank"&gt;TODAY Fitness &lt;/a&gt;contributor, tells TODAY.com. She adds that walking can help you "maintain a healthy weight by burning calories and boosting metabolism while also strengthening the bones and muscles.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-715cd1" class="body-graf"&gt;Plus, she says, “It strengthens the heart and reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke and high blood pressure.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-03ca43" class="body-graf"&gt;According to Mansour, walking also improves balance and coordination, helping to prevent falls and injuries, and improves mental health. “Walking has a positive impact on mental and emotional well-being as it reduces stress, anxiety and depression by releasing endorphins, which are natural mood boosters,” says Mansour. “Walking also improves cognitive function, enhancing memory and concentration. It provides an opportunity to clear your head, and gain a sense of calm and relaxation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-0937fa"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-03-825713.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-03-825713.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-03-825713.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-03-825713.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-03-825713.jpg" alt="Krista Catwood (R) and her group of mall-walkers called “Food Court 5000” wave to shoppers.

Mansour says the environment is a reliable, climate-controlled space “making it accessible year-round, regardless of weather conditions, which can encourage more regular exercise habits.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1c35a3" class="body-graf"&gt;The “visual stimulation” of a mall (bright lights, special events, excited children) can make walking feel less “monotonous” than walking on a treadmill, says Mansour.  Stroll by an Orange Julius or Cinnabon stand and you time-travel back to the good ‘ole days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a8c403" class="body-graf"&gt;“Emotionally, mall walking can tap into feelings of nostalgia and comfort, as many people associate malls with positive memories of social interactions and leisure activities of years past,” explains Mansour. “Mentally, mall walking provides an opportunity to connect with others, combatting feelings of loneliness and isolation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-b2f386"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-02-fd0bbc.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-02-fd0bbc.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-02-fd0bbc.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-02-fd0bbc.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-02-fd0bbc.jpg" alt="Members of “Food Court 5000,” a mall-walking group, stretch it out at the Lloyd Center in Portland, Oregon.

I needed to work movement into my life that was fun, free or cheap, and didn’t feel like a chore.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-470655" class="body-graf"&gt;And so “Food Court 5000” was born. The group welcomes anyone who vibes. “We are a friendly, joyous, blur of neon, waving at kids, shop owners, security guards,” says Catwood. “Everyone knows us.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b86259" class="body-graf"&gt;Not only does it provide a fun, social environment, but a dose of motivation and accountability, too. “You have to &lt;em&gt;look &lt;/em&gt;like a mall walker by pumping your arms in a power walk,” says Catwood. “Otherwise you’re just walking in the mall — you’re not mall walking.” Catwood often yells into her mic, “Get those arms moving! You can do it!” If someone slows down, a buddy pauses to walk alongside them. The group’s mantra: There is no shaming at 'Food Court 500.'”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-d18a08"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-04-31a265.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-04-31a265.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-04-31a265.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-04-31a265.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-04-31a265.jpg" alt="Leslie Kelinson (L) and Krista Catwood (R) lead the way in their walking group “Food Court 5000” at the Lloyd Center in Portland, Oregon.

Start with a comfortable pace and duration. “Even 5 minutes a day can make a difference,” Mansour says, suggesting to gradually increase time and intensity as stamina builds. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-6d1675" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bring a buddy.&lt;/strong&gt; “Walk with a friend or join a mall-walking group for motivation and social support,” says Mansour. “Make mall walking a regular part of your routine by setting specific days and times each week to walk, turning it into a consistent and enjoyable habit.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-9b7fc3"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-05-2d7998.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-05-2d7998.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-05-2d7998.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-05-2d7998.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/1980s-mall-walkers-zz-250710-05-2d7998.jpg" alt="Krista Catwood says that while mall walking did help her lose weight, the biggest benefit was how it changed her mindset on exercise."&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Krista Catwood says that while mall walking did help her lose weight, the biggest benefit was how it changed her mindset on exercise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Melissa Dickerson&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-a937ad" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond Weight Loss: An Attitude Change About Exercise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-350421" class="body-graf"&gt;Catwood says the 10 pounds she lost through “Food Court 5000” is inconsequential. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e76094" class="body-graf"&gt;“It was a catalyst to re-think how I can seek out ... more fun activities that ... get my heart rate up,” says Catwood, adding that changing her attitude toward fitness, “Has relieved a lot of unnecessary pressure and shame that I was putting on myself.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4b75e5" class="body-graf"&gt;Catwood is now roller skating, jumping at the trampoline park, dancing and — her personal favorite — exercising to 80’s and 90’s aerobics videos by Jane Fonda and Richard Simmons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fa4465" class="body-graf"&gt;“Mall walking” is Catwood’s self-care.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7976ef" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Moving my body, getting offline and into my community has really been beneficial to my mental health,” says Catwood. “When we’re out there blasting our tunes and laughing through the halls of the mall, it’s joyous.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>TODAY.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 16:00:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxNUm5HMTVIWkJZajBHYlBGTTFRWFZRT3NHdkFUckRIZjBnQnZJQW5telhTSGZMaWY2UnBvbk42aVgtenR3T1llMXc3NHRQWVVqVjNyUkpQbDRQdHVmZ2RGR1JMVlpraVVvRm5aa2JuT0RtcWxfWWMtVkdheTVpOUhmaUNYLWw1dzB3WG9XRWlYOGU4RlozTmJxazRn0gFUQVVfeXFMTmdXX2NMRWgtR05HdldXOWEyWnpuM3lpa1NRTXRrQXNEbXV0aVBGLWF1ZDlnQ2lCWm9USHVzZmtlUlFsVFNtSF8tdlYtRTVqdGRSb29y</guid></item><item><title>在英国出生的婴儿携带3个人的DNA ：医学突破可以预防遗传疾病-德干先驱报 | Babies born in UK with DNA from 3 people: Medical breakthrough could prevent genetic disorders - Deccan Herald</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1AFBVV95cUxQSFFqUWhwZ3JHeXdxeUZsNk9xcDlpQmhTUTRCdUdSY3RFT2JzWGpnblY1b0Q0NTJFUExfVEhyWnNCbFQ3ZzdIWGJhYWoxdUZ4WUlDVlRiTnpWY0JRRURHUEEtNTEtN2ZLTkFPalZaZ0dRdllCVkQ3RlZJdUxGcnhqa25jajNoVHZzdU4yTnZ2QjdCbndOWEItZ0FLNkZxbGc4WnlYSXRhSkhCdGZNWGVXb2QtLTcxczBlNzZYdDZRaFNiY3IyX3hfdnBqbXhkWEdXV1JtRQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="story-content-952d0531-7a28-48ca-a9e8-372474d020c3" class="story-cards taboola-read-more-container"&gt;&lt;p class="wW6Na"&gt;Published 18 July 2025, 15:54 IST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deccan Herald</author><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jul 2025 15:54:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1AFBVV95cUxQSFFqUWhwZ3JHeXdxeUZsNk9xcDlpQmhTUTRCdUdSY3RFT2JzWGpnblY1b0Q0NTJFUExfVEhyWnNCbFQ3ZzdIWGJhYWoxdUZ4WUlDVlRiTnpWY0JRRURHUEEtNTEtN2ZLTkFPalZaZ0dRdllCVkQ3RlZJdUxGcnhqa25jajNoVHZzdU4yTnZ2QjdCbndOWEItZ0FLNkZxbGc4WnlYSXRhSkhCdGZNWGVXb2QtLTcxczBlNzZYdDZRaFNiY3IyX3hfdnBqbXhkWEdXV1JtRQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
