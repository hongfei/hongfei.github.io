&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin C is necessary for a healthy immune system, joints and disease prevention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The average adult needs 75 mg to 90 mg per day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin C is found in citrus fruits, bell peppers and cruciferous veggies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It may take a sniffly nose, sneezing or a pesky cough to bring vitamin C to mind. Getting sick reminds us of our immune function, which may leave you wondering whether you should take vitamin C daily. Vitamin C is a well-known vitamin in citrus fruits that many people turn to when under the weather. That's because it can enhance immune health and may reduce the length of a cold.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But immune function isn't the only thing vitamin C is necessary for. It's also a crucial nutrient and antioxidant that aids in producing compounds that support different body functions. So, can you benefit from taking a regular vitamin C supplement? Read on to learn more about what happens when you take vitamin C every day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-we-love-vitamin-c"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Why We Love Vitamin C &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Support Immune Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it's common to find bare shelves of vitamin C during flu season, how it impacts immunity is unclear. That said, we do know the skin needs normal levels of vitamin C to maintain a healthy barrier to keep harmful pathogens from entering the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin C is also present in immune cells, so having sufficient levels is vital. Low levels of vitamin C could make you more susceptible to sickness. As an antioxidant, vitamin C protects cells from oxidative damage and regulates anti-inflammatory pathways, helping reduce inflammation and, therefore, the risk of chronic health conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Prevent Lead Poisoning &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Consuming vitamin C may help alleviate lead exposure. Lead is a heavy metal found in some paint, jewelry, soil and other products that is poisonous in high concentrations. Even the most minor blood levels of lead can impact how well a child performs in school. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, routinely eating foods rich in iron, calcium and vitamin C may help keep lead out of the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, more research is needed to understand the beneficial effects. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Might Improve Iron Levels &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to one small study, iron deficiency is the most prevalent micronutrient deficiency.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Populations most at risk are infants, young children, pregnant people and females of reproductive age.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The CDC recommends improving iron absorption by pairing an iron-rich food with a vitamin C-rich food, such as mandarin oranges with salad greens.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And some studies have seen significant differences in iron levels when supplementing with vitamin C and iron compared to iron alone.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is especially true of non-heme iron, the type of iron found in plants.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Improve Joint Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin C is necessary to form collagen, a vital part of connective tissue, which helps mend wounds. While research is mixed on this topic, many studies support vitamin C supplementation for reducing pain and inflammation related to osteoarthritis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is partly due to vitamin C's role in collagen formation, as well as its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Act as an Anti-Tumor Agent &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Thanks to vitamin C's powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, there is evidence that it may act as an anti-tumor agent.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Researchers note that vitamin C is not a replacement for traditional cancer treatment, but an adjunct to it. When used in this way, it may improve treatment results.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Improve Brain Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There is evidence that vitamin C protects neurons (brain cells) against oxidative stress and may be helpful to mental health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For example, one study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that older adults with higher vitamin C intake had lower rates of cognitive decline.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Researchers note that these benefits plateaued at about 500 mg/day of vitamin C, suggesting that more than this offers no further brain benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most people have sufficient vitamin C intake because many consume foods naturally rich in vitamin C or fortified with it. Yet, others may need more. According to the National Cancer Institute, 7% of people in the U.S. have scurvy, a condition where vitamin C levels fall below normal.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Scurvy happens from eating too few vitamin C sources or impaired absorption in the digestive tract. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Symptoms of vitamin C deficiency include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Loss of teeth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swollen, bleeding gums&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle weakness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poor wound healing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anemia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weight loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hyperkeratosis (thickening of the skin's outer layer)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arthralgia (stiff joints)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; How much vitamin C you need depends on your age, sex and whether you're pregnant or breastfeeding. The average adult male needs 90 mg per day, while the average adult female needs 75 mg per day. If you're pregnant, you need 85 mg per day, and if you're breastfeeding, shoot for 120 mg per day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While oranges tend to be the go-to for vitamin C, this nutrient hangs out in lots of nourishing sources, with many of them &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2052728/6-foods-with-more-vitamin-c-than-an-orange/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;having more vitamin C&lt;/a&gt; than an orange. Some of these foods include:

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The recommended daily amount of vitamin C for adults is 90 mg.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Overloading yourself with vitamin C is unlikely, since our body rids what it can't use in urine, but it is still possible to overdo it. For example, digestive upset, including stomach cramps, diarrhea and nausea, commonly occurs when unabsorbed vitamin C is in the intestines.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High vitamin C levels can cause increases in oxalates, which make you more prone to kidney stones, especially for people with poor kidney function. For example, one review reports that vitamin C doses greater than 1 gram may increase the chances of stone formation by 41%.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The same review reported that women taking too much vitamin C during pregnancy could result in rebound scurvy in newborn babies. Excess vitamin C may also affect vitamin B12 and copper levels and cause dental enamel erosion. Because of these health risks, an upper limit for adults ages 19 and up is 2,000 mg daily.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, some people may be taking more under the supervision of a medical provider.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can find &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-vitamin-c-supplements-8686368" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin C supplements&lt;/a&gt; in various forms, such as powders, gummies, chewable tablets, non-chewable tablets and capsules. When looking for one, consider what form of vitamin C will help you be consistent. If mixing powdered vitamin C with water isn't for you, you might choose chewable. If you dislike swallowing pills, you may enjoy gummies, but if you are sensitive to added sugar, you might opt for a capsule. Choose the form that works best for your lifestyle.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Take a close look at supplement ingredient lists to pinpoint any additives it may have, such as artificial colors, added sugars, preservatives or fillers. And while the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-supplement-8645052" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;doesn't regulate supplements&lt;/a&gt;, you can still take steps to ensure your supplement is reliable, safe and effective. Independent labeling can help identify a trustworthy supplement. USP, NSF and ConsumerLabs are examples of independent labels to seek on the packaging or bottle to help ensure you're getting honest ingredients.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Supplements can be costly, and a routine daily dose of a vitamin C supplement isn't necessary for healthy people, since most people have healthy vitamin C levels. Talk to your healthcare provider first if you're considering taking a vitamin C supplement. Otherwise, if you're concerned about getting enough vitamin C foods, simply turn to your local market and stock up on vitamin C-rich fruits and vegetables. Whether fresh, frozen or canned, produce like pineapple, potatoes and bell peppers are plentiful in vitamin C, and enjoying more of them can meet your everyday needs.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin C can be safe to take daily; however, it's helpful to know that you can meet your daily needs by eating vitamin C-rich foods. For instance, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/health-benefits-of-kiwi-8650515" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;a half-cup of kiwi&lt;/a&gt; offers 134 mg of vitamin C, which provides 148% to 178% of the recommended daily needs. Before taking any new supplements, it's best practice to speak with your medical provider and stay below the upper limit for vitamin C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing beats getting vitamin C from whole foods, which is the ultimate form. Many foods are brimming with vitamin C, like citrus fruits, cruciferous veggies and potatoes. If you're still interested in a vitamin C supplement, the best form to take is synthetic ascorbic acid and the presentation you can easily ingest, which for some could be a mixable powder and, for others, an easy-to-swallow capsule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vitamin C supplements can benefit people, especially those with low vitamin C levels. But vitamin C-rich foods, packed with many other essential vitamins and minerals, are better for you.

No, there is no magical pill, but the answer lies in your very own body. Yes, that is right! Movement is one of the most powerful tools for anti-ageing, and reducing the risk of major chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and cognitive decline. Dr. Sanjay Bhojraj, a US cardiologist with 20 years of experience, emphasises that how we move daily is more important than complex health fads or medicine cabinets. Let’s dig deeper…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why movement is the most powerful anti-ageing tool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bhojraj highlights that over 80% of chronic diseases are driven by lifestyle factors - how we move, eat, sleep, and manage stress. Among these, intentional movement is the “most powerful anti-ageing tool” we have. It does not mean intense workouts only; any movement that challenges your muscles and lungs teaches your cells to stay strong and alive. This sets the foundation for healthier ageing. He says, “How you move, eat, sleep, and manage stress determines far more about your longevity than what’s in your medicine cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Why are women more at risk for heart disease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet… most people start at the pharmacy instead of with their physiology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How movement cuts disease risk by 50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Bhojraj, regular strength and aerobic exercises can lower your risk of heart disease, diabetes, and cognitive decline by up to half. This is huge because no medicine can come close to providing these benefits. The movement signals to the mitochondria in your cells - your energy engines to thrive on oxygen and sunlight, powering your longevity naturally. According to Dr Bhojraj, “Studies show consistent strength and aerobic training can lower your risk of heart disease, diabetes, and cognitive decline by up to 50%. No pill comes close to that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Walking: A simple yet powerful step&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need fancy equipment or a gym membership. Dr. Bhojraj points out that consistent daily walking can bring remarkable heart benefits. Walking 10,000 steps or even 20 to 30 minutes daily helps regulate blood pressure, improves circulation, and supports healthy heart rhythms. A study shows that walking daily can reduce heart disease risk by nearly 50%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Movement is key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Movement is not just physical; it also lowers cortisol, the body’s main stress hormone. High cortisol harms the heart and brain. Regular movement eases stress, improving mood and cognitive function. Slower walking pace or lack of movement correlates with higher risks of depression, anxiety, and memory issues, while regular movement protects brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Movement is for everyone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bhojraj encourages integrating movement into daily life in any form—walking, yoga, swimming, or strength training. The message is clear: “To age well, start here, not at the pharmacy.” He further added, “That’s not a hack—it’s how your body was designed to heal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 08:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswJBVV95cUxPc1Z6ZVh6eU5UOFlZS0JGU0dfWmswcklxNnNTZUFibGM1TDRKV3E5Q1BjZzEwRE5UTHVYaEt1QzBicXNoOWlEZFo4aEx3SVh1d1NJRFlZSVJwYU9MMXhRWms5MUp6YzJMOWRDYTB4YmtTYjlEaE9RTDdWWnBKbWNwTEphMno2ZDc2QWR6SG1VelZQT2NsRjRQWWd4NVRQaktYUzRKZzd1RE40bFRmUW5RbFVGNzNPTXV5LWh1d0Y4RXdzWFVQZUdUTFp5Tnh6M1lSOUl3c25pTDM5NHNCS2FndG5YRkNZTjNuUE5PRzdieGtVRDcyRkhkOEY2NHFEeF9Ib0JJcG9Kc1RKbUNSR1ZHVnRfdnBmMWh1ZGloZWN6OVd6c2NkbFZ5eE9QVkdDTlpHOEdj</guid></item><item><title>杂货店里6个最差的热狗品牌- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/finance/6-worst-hot-dog-brands-211701585.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Justin Sullivan/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hot dogs get a bad rap. But a good one, a real one, can hold its own next to a burger or even a steak. The problem is, most of what ends up in grocery carts isn’t that. With summer cookouts around the corner, we looked at some of the most popular grocery brands and checked &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/18x9h8g/what_is_a_hotdog_brand_you_dont_like/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:which ones get the most hate from shoppers on Reddit.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;which ones get the most hate from shoppers on Reddit.com&lt;/a&gt; — and why. Here are the six worst grocery store hot dogs, according to shoppers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gwaltney Great Dogs Original&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwaltney claims these are &lt;a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Gwaltney-Original-Chicken-Hot-Dogs-Bun-Size-3-lb/10452733" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:“America’s No. 1 chicken hot dog,”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;“America’s No. 1 chicken hot dog,”&lt;/a&gt; and their main selling point is that they have 40% less fat than regular beef hot dogs. They’re marketed as a lighter, affordable option, and you’ll usually find them at places like Walmart, Food Lion, and other big grocery chains for about $1.50 to $2 a pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you’re actually getting is a hot dog made mostly of mechanically separated chicken, with some pork, water, corn syrup, and generic “flavorings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re not big in the flavor department either — and judging by Reddit, people have some strong feelings about that. “They are absolutely horrific and the way they look in the frying pan is disturbing me to my core,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/1fujwa2/comment/lpzzhrr/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said one Redditor.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;said one Redditor.&lt;/a&gt;“They’re the second worst hot dog I’ve ever had the displeasure of biting into and then promptly spitting into a napkin and throwing away,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/1fujwa2/comment/lpzx4t8/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:adds another.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;adds another.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;FUD Hot Dogs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll mostly find them at Walmart and select grocery stores, especially in areas with a large Hispanic customer base. They’re priced in the low-to-mid range, usually around $2.50 to $3 a pack, but you’re mostly paying for disappointment. These are made from mechanically separated chicken and pork, with salt, flavoring, and sodium lactate to round out the flavorless parade. Reddit users have roasted FUD consistently for years — many say they couldn’t even finish the pack. The texture is rubbery, the taste is bland and off-putting, and even boiling doesn’t help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bar-S Classic and Beef Franks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bar-S is an ultra-budget brand owned by Sigma (yes, same as FUD), and it’s one of the top-selling hot dog brands in America, not because it’s good, but because it’s dirt cheap. You can find it everywhere from Walmart to Dollar General, usually under $1.50 per pack. It’s also one of the most hated hot dog brands out there. The classic franks are made with mechanically separated chicken and turkey, with a little pork thrown in and beef hearts for flair. Ingredients include corn syrup, sodium nitrite, and potassium lactate. On Reddit and Chowhound, they’re called “possessed,” “mushy,” “too sweet,” and “unsettling in texture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bar s dogs of all flavors are like eating marshmallow meat and they don’t get plump when you cook them”&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/18x9h8g/comment/kg2waog/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one Redditor said.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one Redditor said.&lt;/a&gt; “Mystery meat dogs at their worst.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Oscar Mayer Classic Wieners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oscar Mayer proudly claims their hot dogs have “no fillers,” which feels a bit rich when you flip the package over and see what’s actually in them. The ingredient list starts with mechanically separated chicken and turkey, plus some pork, which translates to mystery meat and a long scroll of additives like sodium phosphate, sodium benzoate, and sodium nitrite. This isn’t exactly a clean label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find these just about everywhere — Target, Kroger, Safeway — for around $3.50 to $5 a pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They do have a nostalgic fan base, but they are also wildly roasted on Reddit for being the “default bad hot dog.” ​​I sometimes think about buying Oscar Mayers hot dogs then I see them on the shelf and I look at their color and then always pass,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/18x9h8g/comment/kg9k6hj/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one user sums it up.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one user sums it up.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ball Park Franks (Regular and Grillmaster)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ball Park is everywhere — Costco, CVS, your neighbor’s Fourth of July cookout. Owned by Tyson Foods, the brand has been around forever and sells a dizzying number of varieties. The regular franks are made from a blend of mechanically separated chicken and pork, corn syrup, and a long list of preservatives. They’re soft, overly sweet, and don’t grill particularly well. According to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/18x9h8g/comment/kgglubl/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one Redditor;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one Redditor&lt;/a&gt;. “They taste like what you imagine hot dog water tastes like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beef versions, especially the Grillmaster line, get noticeably more respect. They’re made with actual beef — no mystery meats — and they cook up with better texture and flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Jennie-O Turkey Franks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennie-O is known for turkey, but these franks don’t do the brand any favors. They show up in most grocery stores — Safeway, Meijer, Albertsons — for around $3 to $4 a pack, and they’re sold as the “healthier” option. But low fat doesn’t mean much when the end result is dry, dense, and painfully bland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ingredients aren’t great either — mechanically separated turkey, water, corn syrup, and not much else. No real seasoning to speak of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;More Hot Dog Stories From Cheapism&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 06:11:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5PbnZ3OVNkT21YS3F6dml2OW1zYXFaeWZxck9aSVI4bnI3VV8tUjY1MVVWeDBTajUxcnBWMENneU9CQjFqSXhoUEoyMWhyVUZWWi1xemRJS3RNbXZaUTNhY1p5R0dZdzFoYjAtTUhmOWxsdm8</guid></item><item><title>哈佛大学训练有素的胃肠病学家AIIMS分享了不健康肠道的5个早期迹象：对饭后腹胀的免疫力低下|健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/aiims-and-harvard-trained-gastroenterologist-shares-5-early-signs-of-unhealthy-gut-weak-immunity-bloating-after-meal-101760237662285.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/aiims-and-harvard-trained-gastroenterologist-shares-5-early-signs-of-unhealthy-gut-weak-immunity-bloating-after-meal-101760237662285.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A compromised &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/gut-microbiota" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="gut"&gt;gut &lt;/a&gt;often becomes the cause of many underlying issues in our body.

Funhealthy gut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the gastroenterologist trained at AIIMS, if you're always feeling gassy or bloated after meals, it could mean your gut bacteria are imbalanced.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Irregular bowel movements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stating irregular bowel movements as a sign of an unhealthy gut, the gastroenterologist said, “Chronic constipation or diarrhoea is often your gut's way of signalling trouble.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Unexplained fatigue&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Poor gut health affects nutrient absorption, leaving you tired even after proper rest,” Dr Saurabh Sethi pointed out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Food intolerances&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If certain foods trigger discomfort, according to the gastroenterologist, your gut microbiome may be struggling to process them properly, which can be an early sign of compromised gut health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Weakened immunity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, a weakened immunity is also an early sign of an unhealthy gut. Dr Sethi noted, “70 percent of your immune system lives in your gut. Frequent colds or infections can mean your gut needs attention.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

This number is projected to increase by 73% by 2040, resulting in approximately 1.6 million deaths per year, according to the WHO. This type of cancer is becoming increasingly common in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjs/article/112/7/znaf102/8191209" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;young people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, and factors including lifestyle play a crucial role. While certain foods can increase the risk of colon cancer, some others can reduce it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine eating some delicious snack and protecting yourself from colon cancer. Yes, you read it right. An indulgent snack and its key ingredient are linked to reduced risk and recurrence of colon cancer. An observational study found that the chance of colon cancer recurrence was nearly cut in half in people who eat nuts and nut butter. The findings are published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5891130/#s8" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Journal of Clinical Oncology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in India and it’s fully treatable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The role of nuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Basic healthy eating can often be overlooked during cancer treatment. This study demonstrates that a simple dietary change, such as eating tree nuts, may have a significant impact on a patient's long-term survival. Nut consumption and a healthy diet are generally factors that clinicians and patients should perhaps pay attention to as they design the approach to treatment for colorectal cancer," ASCO President Daniel F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hayes, MD, FACP, FASCO, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The observational study examined 826 patients with stage III colon cancer. They found that nuts, especially peanuts, had a profound impact on colon cancer. In patients who consumed two ounces or more of nuts per week, they saw a 42% lower chance of cancer recurrence and a 57% lower chance of death than those who did not eat nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the benefit of nut consumption was limited to tree nuts in a secondary analysis. These include almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts, cashews, and pecans, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Numerous studies in the fields of heart disease and diabetes have shown the benefits of nut consumption, and we felt that it was important to determine if these benefits could also apply to colorectal cancer patients," Temidayo Fadelu, MD, a clinical fellow in medicine at Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and lead author, said. "Patients with advanced disease who benefit from chemotherapy frequently ask what else they can do to reduce their chances of recurrence or death, and our study is an important contribution to the idea that modifying diet and physical activity can be beneficial," Fadelu added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They observed no associated reduction in cancer recurrence and death among patients who consumed peanuts or peanut butter. It could be because being legumes, peanuts have a different metabolic composition than tree nuts, the authors said. Also, peanuts are by far the most widely consumed nut in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with stage III colon cancer have up to a 70% chance of surviving three years after treatment, which typically includes surgery and/or chemotherapy. Though previous studies have looked at the role of diet as a potential cancer prevention role, this is the first to examine the benefits of nuts in treating colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the study, the researchers analyzed a questionnaire from a CALGB clinical trial of patients with stage III colon cancer that began in 1999. They asked about the patients’ dietary intake, including whether or not patients ate nuts and what types of nuts they consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were eager to know about nut consumption, as it is already linked to lower incidence of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and a reduction in insulin resistance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study focused on the associations between overall nut consumption and just tree nut consumption and the risk of cancer recurrence and death. They found that patients who consumed two or more ounces of all types of nuts per week (19% of all patients in the study) had a 42% lower chance of cancer recurrence and a 57% lower chance of death than those patients who did not eat nuts after completion of their cancer treatment. In people who reported tree nut consumption, the chance of recurrence was 46% lower and the chance of death was 53% lower in those who ate at least two ounces per week, compared to those who didn’t. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Trump Undergoes Mystery Health Checkup At Walter Reed Amid Growing Speculations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the experts saying?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tree nuts consumption can be crucial in both preventing and cutting the risk of recurrence of colon cancer. "It should be emphasized that the authors are not suggesting that eating nuts should be considered a substitute for standard chemotherapy and other treatments for colon cancer, which have dramatically improved survival. Rather, patients with colon cancer should be optimistic, and they should eat a healthy diet, including tree nuts, which may not only keep them healthier, but may also further decrease the chances of the cancer coming back," Dr. Hayes said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to look at the potential positive impact of nut consumption on survival at other stages of colon cancer, particularly stage IV. Ultimately, we need to understand how nuts confer this protective effect, as well as possibly conduct a randomized, controlled clinical trial where diet recommendations are given at the start of the study to prove that tree nuts can reduce recurrence and death after treatment for colon cancer," Dr. Fadelu added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 01:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi8AFBVV95cUxQck1lTDdRN25kdm1MT3pNQWR3NUZsaTB3NTd0UVU2ajJJSHZPN0M4aWE0SkJFQUpUekFYbnBZYzdNaEM1Q2pEeVdLQlVKblIzd1JOcEgtNEdMNmVvY0laZVdnR3RiM0tjcGc5NkJ3eG9ROFlXZzFwb2NMOFZPV3YzLU9uSWxZMTN1UXhPS1dUWnVFMnlZSXgxQkRiTFpZXzJ0azZHUDVnMVM1M0p1emVwV2FSSG5JSUVHMl9uemxYYi1iTHVXazNkVUdtcFV5UnZuTlRRT09TbDhXSzF2OXNHOFl1cFlxRHNUaDBwOFdDQzc</guid></item><item><title>又一场大流行即将来临？致命疾病袭击日本，超过4000人住院，学校因...而关闭，最高- india.com</title><link>https://www.india.com/news/world/another-pandemic-coming-deadly-disease-hits-japan-over-4000-hospitalised-due-to-influenza-schools-kindergartens-childcare-centres-closed-highest-case-reported-in-okinawa-prefecture-8127388/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="expandheight"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The world has not yet moved on from the deadly COVID-19 pandemic that caused global shutdowns, left lives in disarray, and millions dead across the planet. Now, as countries continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, Japan is facing another health crisis: a sudden outbreak of seasonal influenza.  Reports suggest that over 4,000 people have already been infected, and the numbers will likely continue to climb as the temperature decreases daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt; 
            &lt;/p&gt;
           
&lt;p&gt;Japan’s Ministry of Health announced an epidemic on October 3 after 4,030 people were treated for influenza at country-designated medical institutions in the week starting September 22 – an increase of 957 cases from the previous week. Citing Japan’s Ministry of Health, Japan Today reported that this is the second time in 20 years that an early seasonal change has led to a widespread outbreak of the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;According to the Japan Today report, approximately 3,000 hospitals nationwide reported a combined 4,030 flu patients during the seven-day period through Sunday. The highest number of flu patients per hospital is reported in Okinawa Prefecture. Tokyo and Kagoshima have also witnessed higher numbers of flu patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="v-india-v0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;According to Japan’s Ministry of Health, the number of patients exceeds the epidemic threshold, with an average of 1.04 patients per medical institution. The infection spread rapidly among children. In that same timeframe, 135 schools, kindergartens, and childcare centres were closed due to outbreaks among children, which was three times the number reported in the same week last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="PreferredSources-content"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Add India.com as a Preferred Source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i class="google-preferred-source-btn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=https://www.india.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img class="lazy" data-src="https://static.india.com/wp-content/themes/icommobile/images/google-preferred-source-btn-mobile.png" src="https://static.india.com/wp-content/themes/icom/images/cwv-icon/1x1.svg" alt="Add India.com as a Preferred Source"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="cre_render_news" class="cre_render_news"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Typically, the flu season in Japan occurs from December to March. Last season began in early November, peaked just before New Year’s, and was called over by April. Due to the rising cases, the Ministry has urged the public to exercise caution and practice preventive behaviors, which include handwashing and wearing masks. The specific strain has not been identified yet, and officials have suggested vaccination for young children, the elderly, and/or those with comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While speaking to the South China Morning Post, Professor Yoko Tsukamoto from the Health Sciences University of Hokkaido said, “The flu season has started really early this year, but in the changing global environment this might become a more common scenario.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;According to health officials and scientists, there are several reasons behind the surge. One important factor has been the return of mass international tourism in the post-pandemic environment, which has greatly increased the movement of people, and therefore, the movement of viruses, across national borders.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;“We are seeing a greater circulation of people, both in Japan and globally, with people taking the virus to new places, which is another factor behind the virus adapting to new environments,” she further added. With the height of flu season predicted to come earlier than typical, Tsukamoto urged the community to get vaccinated early.&lt;/p&gt;

Immunity has waned and people are getting ill." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;There are actually more than 100 different viruses that cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections, plus some bacterial infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;Is there more illness than normal?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ukhsa-dashboard.data.gov.uk/" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;Data collection from the UK Health Security Agency&lt;/a&gt; (UKHSA) shows Rhinovirus – what many of us would call the common cold – has been on the increase in recent weeks and seems to be the most common cause of illness at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Covid is also doing the rounds, driven by two new variants – XFG, called Stratus by some, and NB.1.8.1, known as Nimbus. But there is already a high degree of immunity built up in the population meaning, for most, it's a fairly mild infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;There are signs flu may be on the rise too – there has been an increase in the 15-25 age group over the past week - while RSV, which can cause serious illness in young children, also tends to take off in the autumn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"There is often, although not always, a pattern," says Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, a consultant epidemiologist at UKHSA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"You tend to see Rhinovirus take off first and then RSV," he explains. "Flu tends to come later in December and January. But that's not always the case – and certainly the pandemic disrupted the traditional seasonal trends. What we've seen in the last year or so is those trends return to something like normal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;He says the levels of illnesses at the moment are not particularly high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Covid is above baseline and there's a lot of Rhinovirus around. The uptick in flu in that younger age group has perhaps come a little bit earlier than we would expect, but it is still at a low level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;Is it a cold, flu or Covid?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The most common symptoms, according to the NHS, are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;b id="colds" class="sc-d16436d-0 kPzeuB"&gt;Colds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 bYhyhr"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Symptoms appear gradually&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Mostly affect nose and throat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Early sign - pressure in your ears&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Chestier, mucus cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;b id="flu" class="sc-d16436d-0 kPzeuB"&gt;Flu&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 bYhyhr"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Comes on suddenly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Feel wiped out&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Fever, muscle aches, exhaustion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Need bed rest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Dry cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;b id="covid" class="sc-d16436d-0 kPzeuB"&gt;Covid&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 bYhyhr"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Typical flu symptoms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Loss of taste of smell&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Diarrhoea or tummy upset&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Many of the symptoms between cold, flu and more serious viruses like Covid overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;How can you protect yourself?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Respiratory infections can, of course, be really dangerous for vulnerable people - in a bad winter tens of thousands of people can die of flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But there is nothing to suggest the respiratory viruses circulating now are causing more serious illness this year in otherwise healthy people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"We all react in different ways – and we don't really understand why," admits Prof Ball. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Of course, age and fitness have a lot to do with it, but sometimes it is just your individual genetics or how tired and rundown you may be, or when you were last exposed to that particular virus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In terms of protecting yourself, the most important step to take, if you are eligible, is to get vaccinatinated. Shots are being offered for &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/vaccination-and-booking-services/get-a-free-rsv-vaccination/" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;flu, Covid and RSV&lt;/a&gt; to protect those who are most at-risk of serious illness, which includes older people and those with certain health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;If you are ill, UKHSA says you can help protect others by washing your hands regularly, especially after coughing or sneezing, staying at home if you can and consider wearing a mask if you do have to go into public places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Prof Ball says it is right to take precautions to try to protect vulnerable people, but adds if you are healthy and young or of working age, getting the odd respiratory illness is pretty inevitable and not necessarily a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Most people will get one or two respiratory infections every year. In some ways, it's a good thing when you are a child or healthy adult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"By getting exposed you are building up your immunity through natural infection - so when you are older you hopefully have enough immunity to not get severely ill."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 23:07:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1SMWdvdzItbTc5T2lXdml6VERIN25XUHR2YU92NGxNVExPSmg0cEVnMDFRcWYzOVFTYnFPQWwxaWFxUEFvM3VoS0FJOXhwTW5nNHV2eFZFRDZuQdIBX0FVX3lxTE1uTkUtSEVldXB3NTJ0WVR1MVJ4Vml2RW1HNDNUWDl4aXBYZ1NMN24zLTVEWXNfX1NEZzNaODNEQjlVQzFIcmhqWFotUVRMZDU4WDlqclZxaWRiWW5KQ0l3</guid></item><item><title>由哈佛大学训练有素的医生推荐的5种抗衰老补充剂-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/5-anti-aging-supplements-recommended-by-a-harvard-trained-doctor/photostory/124472716.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;PectaSol is a pure citrus pectin for increased absorption.

The need for a new "out-of-the-clump" way of thinking about Alzheimer's is emerging as a top priority in brain science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My laboratory at the Krembil Brain Institute, part of the University Health Network in Toronto, is devising a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/trc2.12283"&gt;new theory of Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on our past 30 years of research, we no longer think of Alzheimer's as primarily a disease of the brain. Rather, we believe that Alzheimer's is principally &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1567205018666211202141650"&gt;a disorder of the immune system within the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immune system, found in every organ in the body, is a collection of cells and molecules that work in harmony to help repair injuries and protect from foreign invaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_launch"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Launch" class="alignnone wp-image-177073 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a person trips and falls, the immune system helps to mend the damaged tissues. When someone experiences a viral or bacterial infection, the immune system helps in the fight against these microbial invaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact same processes are present in the brain. When there is head trauma, the brain's immune system kicks into gear to help repair. When bacteria are present in the brain, the immune system is there to fight back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144645" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144645" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/WhiteBloodCellsImmuneSystem642.jpg" alt="Bright green cells with orange spots in between them" class="size-full wp-image-144645" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/WhiteBloodCellsImmuneSystem642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/WhiteBloodCellsImmuneSystem642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/WhiteBloodCellsImmuneSystem642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144645" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;White blood cells of the immune system, activated to fight a bacterial infection.

It is supposed to be there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When brain trauma occurs or when bacteria are present in the brain, beta-amyloid is a key contributor to the brain's comprehensive immune response. And this is where the problem begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of striking similarities between the fat molecules that make up both the membranes of bacteria and the membranes of brain cells, beta-amyloid cannot tell the difference between invading bacteria and host brain cells, and mistakenly attacks the very brain cells it is supposed to be protecting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This leads to a chronic, progressive loss of brain cell function, which ultimately culminates in dementia – all because our body's immune system cannot differentiate between bacteria and brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When regarded as a misdirected attack by the brain's immune system on the very organ it is supposed to be defending, Alzheimer's disease emerges as an autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many types of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, in which autoantibodies play a crucial role in the development of the disease, and for which steroid-based therapies can be effective. But these therapies will not work against Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain is a very special and distinctive organ, recognized as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234155/#"&gt;the most complex structure in the Universe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144646" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144646" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderCoupleReadingABookTogether642.jpg" alt="A senior man and woman looking at a book together" class="size-full wp-image-144646" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderCoupleReadingABookTogether642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderCoupleReadingABookTogether642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderCoupleReadingABookTogether642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144646" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Alzheimer's is arguably one of the most important diseases confronting humankind. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAD5TsR1koQ/"&gt;Robert Kneschke/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our model of Alzheimer's, beta-amyloid helps to protect and bolster our immune system, but unfortunately, it also plays a central role in the autoimmune process that, we believe, may lead to the development of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though drugs conventionally used in the treatment of autoimmune diseases may not work against Alzheimer's, we strongly believe that targeting other immune-regulating pathways in the brain will lead us to new and effective treatment approaches for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/first-of-its-kind-study-identifies-how-the-brain-could-thwart-alzheimers"&gt;First-of-Its-Kind Study Identifies How The Brain Could Thwart Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other theories of the disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to this autoimmune theory of Alzheimer's, many other new and varied theories are beginning to appear. For example, some scientists believe that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mito.2022.05.001"&gt;Alzheimer's is a disease of tiny cellular structures called mitochondria&lt;/a&gt; – the energy factories in every brain cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria convert oxygen from the air we breathe and glucose from the food we eat into the energy required for remembering and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some maintain that it is the end-result of a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/1673-5374.339476"&gt;particular brain infection&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/prd.12429"&gt;bacteria from the mouth often being suggested as the culprit&lt;/a&gt;. Still others suggest that the disease may arise from an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/biom12050714"&gt;abnormal handling of metals within the brain&lt;/a&gt;, possibly zinc, copper, or iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is gratifying to see &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2021-327370"&gt;new thinking about this age-old disease&lt;/a&gt;. Dementia currently affects more than 50 million people worldwide, with a new diagnosis being made every three seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, people living with Alzheimer's disease are unable to recognize their own children or even their spouse of more than 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's is a public health crisis in need of innovative ideas and fresh directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144650" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144650" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/YoungPersonKissingASeniorLadyOnTheCheek642.jpg" alt="A young person kissing an older lady on the cheek" class="size-full wp-image-144650" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/YoungPersonKissingASeniorLadyOnTheCheek642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/YoungPersonKissingASeniorLadyOnTheCheek642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/YoungPersonKissingASeniorLadyOnTheCheek642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144650" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Often, people living with Alzheimer's disease are unable to recognize their own children.

But the label that people often unthinkingly slap on toxic bosses or reality TV villains hides a much more complicated psychological picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychologists have studied narcissism for many years, but over time, our understanding has evolved. One of the biggest changes is that today, narcissism is no longer seen as just grandiosity, arrogance or egotism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early scientific descriptions of narcissism &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735807001602?via%3Dihub"&gt;focused on dominance&lt;/a&gt;, ambition and self-importance, all of which are traits associated with traditional masculine stereotypes. That meant narcissistic tendencies in women were often misread or overlooked. When those traits &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0038231"&gt;show up as emotional sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;, insecurity or relational manipulation, they sometimes still are misdiagnosed as anxiety, mood disorders or &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1090746/full"&gt;borderline personality disorder&lt;/a&gt; traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most extreme and persistent forms of narcissism can sometimes be diagnosed as narcissistic personality disorder. This condition was added to the &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-14907-000"&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&lt;/a&gt;, the American Psychiatric Association’s diagnostic manual, in 1980. But most people with narcissistic tendencies won’t meet the threshold for a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So what does the research actually say?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Narcissism in general is &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09637214211044109"&gt;now understood&lt;/a&gt; as a complex set of personality characteristics that can show up in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychologists had long suspected that there might be different kinds of narcissism, but it wasn’t until 1991 – when researcher Paul Wink and his colleagues &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.61.4.590"&gt;presented a model&lt;/a&gt; including grandiose and vulnerable subtypes – that they were more formally recognised. Although there are other models, this remains one of the more popular approaches to understanding narcissistic tendencies in the wider population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09637214211044109"&gt;2021 review&lt;/a&gt; by US psychologist Joshua Miller and his colleagues pulled together decades of research to offer one of the most authoritative summaries of how psychologists now understand narcissism. It explains that narcissism has a common foundation, which includes things such as self-importance and entitlement. It then branches into different forms of narcissism, such as grandiosity, antagonism and vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers now often use the terms &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735807001602?via%3Dihub"&gt;grandiose and vulnerable&lt;/a&gt; to describe two major forms of narcissism. One person with narcissistic traits may be bold with high levels of grandiose traits, confidence and emotional resilience. Another might be defensive, anxious and hypersensitive to criticism. Both show signs of narcissistic self-focus, but they end up looking quite different in how they experience and express emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S019188692100773X?via%3Dihub"&gt;2022 research paper&lt;/a&gt; I wrote with colleagues, we carried out the first meta-analysis examining how narcissistic traits relate to the ability to control one’s emotions. The results showed that vulnerable narcissism is consistently associated with greater emotional difficulty, which means these people might find it harder to keep their emotions in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, people with high scores on vulnerable narcissism scales are more likely to rely on suppression. Suppression is a strategy that people use to hide or inhibit their emotional expressions, and has been linked to &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.85.2.348"&gt;poorer wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;. On the surface, suppression might sound like self-control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some situations, it can be. For example, keeping a lid on your emotions when your boss is yelling at you. But trying to mute emotional expression without addressing the underlying emotions increases stress when it becomes our default strategy. It can worsen mental and physical health over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, grandiose narcissism wasn’t linked with emotion regulation difficulties. In fact, several of the studies included in our analysis suggest that people with higher levels of grandiose traits may not experience as much emotional distress in the first place. This challenges the popular idea among researchers that people who exhibit narcissistic tendencies are also experiencing emotional instability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Emotional intelligence and self-perception&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The differences between forms of narcissism show up in emotional intelligence research as well. In a &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17540739211014585"&gt;2021 systematic review&lt;/a&gt; on narcissism and emotional intelligence, my colleagues and I found that people with grandiose traits often said they were good at understanding and managing emotions. For instance, how well they think they can handle anger or recognise other’s emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when their skills were tested using emotion tasks (such as recognising facial expressions or identifying the best way to respond to an emotional situation), their performance didn’t always match up with how skilled they said they were. This is consistent with a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01606/full"&gt;2018 study&lt;/a&gt; which also found that people with grandiose tendencies rated themselves as emotionally skilled but performed worse on skill-based emotional intelligence tasks compared to other participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, people with vulnerable narcissistic traits tend to rate themselves lower in emotional intelligence, and seem to genuinely struggle more with managing emotions in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So what should we make of all this?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s time to move beyond the pop-psych trend of labelling difficult people as narcissists. Narcissism isn’t about taking too many selfies. And no, the partner who ghosted you or the colleague who dominates meetings isn’t necessarily high in narcissistic traits either – no matter how much we might like to complain about them over coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These kinds of casual diagnoses aren’t just unhelpful, they’re often wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Narcissism is a complex psychological pattern that can show up in different ways and can reflect a deeper struggle with things such as self-esteem, emotion regulation and social connection. Understanding this doesn’t excuse people’s bad behaviour – not at all. But it does help us look past the stereotypes to get a clearer picture of what narcissistic traits look like in everyday life.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/258505/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/258505/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

The Maricopa County Environmental Services Vector Control Division said they’ve been receiving more complaints in the last 10 days compared to all of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Division manager John Townsend said they’ve received almost a thousand community complaints in the last week or so, bringing them up to about 3,000 for the calendar year so far. All of 2024, Townsend said, they received around 1,000 community complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’ve been very small, and it’s been a lot at once. They bit me up. This is the most I've ever been bit by mosquitoes in my life,” said Phoenix resident Tayja.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In the video player above, find out the difference between the mosquitoes you see during the day and at night and what you can do to protect yourself. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Particularly in Tokyo, Okinawa and Kagoshima at least 135 schools and childcare centres have been temporarily shut down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Warning of a fast-evolving virus&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Professor Yoko Tsukamoto of the Health Sciences University of Hokkaido spoke to the Japanese media, saying, “The flu season has started really early this year, but in the changing global environment this might become a more common scenario.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tsukamoto advised common precautions like vaccination, wearing masks, washing hands regularly and avoiding spreading infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have been urging the vulnerable population including the elderly, children and those with pre-existing conditions to get vaccinated immediately. “For most healthy individuals, the flu may be unpleasant but not dangerous. But for vulnerable groups, early vaccination is crucial,” added Tsukamoto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 17:11:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>25年前，果园港的人预计会得阿尔茨海默氏症。为什么不呢？ -《西雅图时报》</title><link>https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/port-orchard-man-was-expected-to-get-alzheimers-25-years-ago-why-hasnt-he/</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxNSUdCMGdOaEVFWGdDSVppbjdOYkZjZE1KdGZ2RkZUNFVQVU5zYjNUbWh5NmlMRDNrcDkwSS0zSjhBaTdHR0pZS1hJWEV1OTdCeV9fUEpuR09vV0llbXdWaXJhcV84T3kya1ZLQVZaNEVvZXRLSGlUSVZVNmNmTFJnQ3Jjd2lHV0swV1FKOHZUOVB4ZS05Wk01S2lFTGFrd3pETzU1VFJRR3pBN291UzRKQ2Z2UTZ4YWhpYU5MdVpSQ2o?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Port Orchard man was expected to get Alzheimer’s 25 years ago.

&lt;p&gt;Of course, not scratching isn’t the only way to speed up your recovery, and there are a few &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/about/about-mosquito-bites.html" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7956216" data-affiliate="true"&gt;other steps&lt;/a&gt; you want to take to prevent infection and make sure your bite gets better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The very first thing you want to do after you get bit is wash the bite out with soap and water. This will help remove &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/insect-bites-and-stings/#:~:text=Easing%20your%20symptoms,do%20to%20ease%20your%20symptoms." target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7956216" data-affiliate="true"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; near the bite that could cause an infection. A mosquito bite is technically a small wound, said Frable, and “it’s generally a good idea to wash all wounds gently with soap and water.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, you want to apply ice to the bite, ideally for about 10 minutes or so, Pritt explained. Ice can drastically reduce the itching along with inflammation, pain and swelling, according to the &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17695-mosquito-bites#:~:text=Ice:%20Ice%20can%20slow%20down,vera%20is%20a%20succulent%20plant." target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7956216" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next up: Cover the bite with an anti-itch or antihistamine cream, such as calamine lotion or hydrocortisone. &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17695-mosquito-bites" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7956216" data-affiliate="true"&gt;These products&lt;/a&gt; can drastically reduce itchiness and, most importantly, prevent you from scratching the bite and break the scratch-itch cycle, Pritt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t have these items in your medicine cabinet or aren’t able to get to a pharmacy, you can whip up an &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mosquito-bites/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20375314" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7956216" data-affiliate="true"&gt;anti-itch paste&lt;/a&gt; at home. Simply combine a tablespoon of baking soda with a splash of water to create a thick paste. Then, rub the mixture over the bite, wait 10 minutes, and wash it off. This DIY concoction reduces itch, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mosquito-bites/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20375314" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7956216" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;, but, better yet, it prevents you from scratching the bite and making things even worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, you want to keep an eye on the bite and pay attention to any symptoms you develop over the next week or two. It’s fairly common to develop a fever or even swollen lymph nodes immediately after the bite, so don’t panic if you experience &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/about/about-mosquito-bites.html#:~:text=What%20happens%20when%20a%20mosquito,soreness,%20and%20redness%20can%20occur.&amp;amp;text=The%20body%20reacts%20to%20mosquito%20saliva%20following%20a%20blood%20meal." target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7956216" data-affiliate="true"&gt;these symptoms&lt;/a&gt; right away, Pritt said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all mosquitoes carry disease, but some spread Zika, dengue and West Nile virus, all of which can cause severe illnesses and health complications. You can’t tell if a mosquito carried a pathogen by simply looking at the bite, according to Frable, which is why it’s crucial to pay attention to any symptoms. So, if you get a fever, a rash, severe headache, or confusion a week or two after the bite, check in with a physician. They can run diagnostics tests to determine if you contracted a mosquito-borne disease and administer supportive care to help you recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, most mosquito bites resolve without any issues. But the less you itch and the better you take care of it, the sooner it’ll clear up … until the next mosquito comes along. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-to-do-mosquito-bite_l_66c4c636e4b0047d36bf6f3a" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7956216"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, researchers have successfully fabricated and characterized a fully functional mirror-image nanopore—a molecular gateway built entirely from D-amino acids, the mirror-image forms of the natural building blocks of proteins. The work, led by Prof. Dr. Kozhinjampara R. Mahendran at the Rajiv Gandhi Center for Biotechnology (India) in collaboration with Constructor University and other partners, demonstrates not only a major milestone in nanoscience but also opens promising biomedical applications, including potential cancer therapies.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;Proteins in nature are almost exclusively built from L-amino acids, while their D-amino acid counterparts usually play only minor roles. Constructing entire proteins from D-amino acids is extremely challenging, yet offers striking advantages: Such mirror-image structures are often more resistant to degradation and may interact differently with biological systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, the team designed a synthetic stable and well-defined D-peptide &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/pore/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;pore&lt;/a&gt; called DpPorA. Remarkably, by modifying the charge distribution, they were able to create superior versions of these pores with enhanced conductance and selectivity under different salt conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experiments revealed that these pores can detect a broad spectrum of biomolecules at the single-molecule level, including peptides, cyclic sugars, certain proteins including one that is central to Parkinson's disease research. Fluorescence imaging confirmed that the pores form large, flexible channels in membranes, enabling size-dependent transport of molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our simulations provided the molecular-level picture needed to prove that these mirror-image pores are exact counterparts of their natural analogs," says Prof. Dr. Ulrich Kleinekathöfer, Professor of Physics at Constructor University in Bremen and co-author of the study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-64025-6" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt;. "This understanding was essential to explain the experiments and will guide the design of improved pore variants in the future."&lt;/p&gt;

																																						&lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
    
     
&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="8188791252"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;The simulations carried out by scientists at Constructor University were key to verifying the architecture of the mirror-image pore. By comparing the D-pore with its natural L-counterpart, the molecular dynamics studies confirmed that the two are perfect structural reflections, while also explaining subtle differences in conductance and selectivity observed in the experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The computational work gave us the confidence that we were indeed looking at a true mirror-image pore," explains Dr. Kalyanashis Jana, postdoctoral researcher in Kleinekathöfer's group and equally contributing first author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond fundamental science, the results suggest exciting biomedical potential. In cell studies, fluorescently tagged mirror-image pores showed strong membrane-disrupting effects in &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/cancer+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cancer cells&lt;/a&gt; but had no impact on &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/normal+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;normal cells&lt;/a&gt;, hinting at selective cytotoxicity that could one day be harnessed for cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also reflects the continuity of scientific collaboration across borders and generations. Both Mahendran and his colleague Dr. Harsha Bajaj earned their Ph.D.s under Prof. Dr. Mathias Winterhalter at the former Jacobs University Bremen (now Constructor University). Today, they continue to collaborate with Constructor University scientists, exemplifying the long-lasting networks of expertise that drive scientific progress.&lt;/p&gt;

Choline is an essential nutrient also found in protein sources such as salmon and beef and chicken livers that supports memory, mood and muscle control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's thought to boost levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which controls memory and learning, and reduce levels of neurotoxins like homocysteine that damage neurons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Eggs are rich in brain-healthy nutrients like choline, which supports memory and learning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002231662400289X"&gt;The Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; found that older adults who consumed more than one egg per week had a 47 percent reduced risk of dementia compared to those who had less than one egg in a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers, from the Rush University Memory and Aging Project in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/chicago/index.html" id="mol-b7c70501-ae68-11ef-a4f6-17bf25becc42" class=""&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, noted this was likely due to the choline in the eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another study published last month in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/16/19/3340"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt; looked at more than 400 adults in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/china/index.html" id="mol-b7c70500-ae68-11ef-a4f6-17bf25becc42" class=""&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; over age 50, half of whom were diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found that participants who ate eggs every day had a lower risk of dementia than those eating them only weekly or monthly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One large egg also contains six grams of protein, which provides amino acids needed to produce neurotransmitters like serotonin. Serotonin is crucial for cognitive function and reducing levels of toxic amyloid-beta plaques, a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Berries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dark chocolate contains compounds called flavonoids, which increase blood flow to the brain and prevent damage (stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chocolate is generally seen as a 'guilty pleasure' and something most people should limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in moderation, dark chocolate has been shown to lower the risk of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dark chocolate is rich in flavonoids, compounds found in plant-based foods that have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, much like berries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Flavonoids also increase blood flow to the brain, preventing damage and improving overall function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A bar of dark chocolate can contain anywhere from 200 milligrams to 1,000 milligrams depending on the size, manufacturer and cacao percentage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent study published in &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-025-01176-1"&gt;Nature Food&lt;/a&gt; of 125,000 people found those who consumed the widest variety of flavonoids, including dark chocolate, had a 14 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/your-brain-on-chocolate-2017081612179"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;

A meta-analysis of 27 randomized trials, showed that statin therapy helped reduce adverse cardiovascular events &lt;a href="https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2016/11/17/09/03/summarizing-the-current-state-and-evidence-on-efficacy-and-safety-of-statin-therapy#:~:text=In%20a%20meta-analysis%20of,mortality%20is%20reduced%20by%2010%25."&gt;by twenty to twenty-five percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are statins right for me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason statins are so widely prescribed is because they work. They’re often prescribed as the first level of defense. This isn't to say that they’re the only way to get your cholesterol levels down. Dropping weight, moving more, and changing your diet can also make big shifts. Still, sometimes lifestyle changes alone are not enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“​​Diet can lower LDL by about ten to fifteen percent which may be sufficient for some people to achieve their LDL goal level,” said McGowan. “However, there are many people for whom diet is insufficient either because they already have cardiovascular disease or because they have genetic conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on what your doctor advises, a combination of lifestyle changes and medications might be necessary. People more prone to heart disease or stroke, including &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cholesterol/treating_cholesterol.htm#:~:text=Statin%20drugs%20lower%20LDL%20cholesterol,is%20already%20in%20the%20blood."&gt;men over forty&lt;/a&gt;, should also think more seriously about medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the side effects of statins?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statins come with a number of potential side effects. Some of these can be relatively minor like dizziness, constipation, or flatulence. They can also include things like muscle pain. More rarely, statins have been associated with things like memory loss, liver inflammation, and an increase in diabetes. Board-certified cardiologist R. Todd Hurst found that in his clinical experience side effects impacted about &lt;a data-offer-url="https://blogs.webmd.com/heart-health/20210121/considering-statins-what-a-cardiologist-wants-you-to-know" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://blogs.webmd.com/heart-health/20210121/considering-statins-what-a-cardiologist-wants-you-to-know"}' href="https://blogs.webmd.com/heart-health/20210121/considering-statins-what-a-cardiologist-wants-you-to-know" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ten percent of people&lt;/a&gt;, which was similar to the numbers found in research trials, with the most-common side effect being sore muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p role="heading" aria-level="3" class="heading-h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ideally, statins are paired with a healthy lifestyle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many experts, lifestyle changes take center stage, especially as preventative measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people prefer to avoid taking medications and try to lower their cholesterol, as statins have been shown to increase cortisol, which in turn trigger a chain reaction with your body’s natural hormone production,” said Dr. Darren Clair, Chief Medical Officer at &lt;a data-offer-url="https://rebalancehealth.com/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://rebalancehealth.com/"}' href="https://rebalancehealth.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Rebalance Health&lt;/a&gt;. “Eating a whole food plant-based diet, as well as managing stress, getting enough quality sleep, and maintaining natural, healthy hormone levels in a comprehensive manner is the best way to achieve optimal health and minimize your risk of all chronic health conditions including heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the best course of action for figuring out whether or not you should be using statins is always going to be talking things through with a medical professional and chatting about the potential cost/benefits. But if you're a person who is at higher risk for a cardiovascular event—again looking at men over forty and overweight folks—then that might be a conversation you want to be having sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div class="ExternalLinkEmbedWrapper-hyhwEF gAlnVg" data-testid="external-link-embed--inline"&gt;&lt;div class="ExternalLinkEmbedText-gqUJZT bQrYnp"&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE ExternalLinkEmbedRubric-hJfSsX bLcSov cpCFUv"&gt;Read More&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a attributes="[object Object]" class="external-link-embed__hed-link button" href="/story/cholesterol-explained"&gt;&lt;span class="BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE ExternalLinkEmbedHed-dDmZdb deqABF fHNWjh jMVqeX"&gt;The Good and the Bad of Cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gzmcOU BaseText-eqOrNE ExternalLinkEmbedDek-bINJOE deqABF eKqexI pjXVm"&gt;Cholesterol isn't straightforward.

&lt;p class="pw-incontent-excluded article-paragraph skip"&gt;Scientists have developed a nanoparticle-based treatment that successfully reversed Alzheimer’s disease in mice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;As detailed in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-025-02426-1" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy&lt;/em&gt;, the team co-led by the Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia, Spain (IBEC), and West China Hospital, Sichuan University, developed bioactive “supramolecular drugs” that can proactively repair the blood-brain barrier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The barrier plays an important role in the health of the brain, defending it from harmful substances and other pathogens. Alzheimer’s has been linked to a weakening of the barrier’s integrity, allowing for impairing toxins to make it through.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;More specifically, the disease causes a “waste” protein, called amyloid-beta, to accumulate in the brain by interrupting its natural clearance system. The team’s approach allows these protein molecules to pass through the blood-brain barrier and be eliminated through the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;In a series of experiments, the team used gene-hacked mice that produce large amounts of the protein and therefore show Alzheimer’s-like declines in cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Administered doses of the supramolecular drugs caused levels of the protein to decline almost immediately in the mice’s brains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Only one hour after the injection, we observed a reduction of 50-60 percent in amyloid-beta amount inside the brain,” said coauthor and West China Hospital of Sichuan University researcher in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-10-scientists-reverse-alzheimer-mice-nanoparticles.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;It’s a promising new approach to treating a disease that &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/facts-figures" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;affects over seven million Americans&lt;/a&gt; age 65 and older. Barring any breakthroughs, that number could grow to almost 14 million by 2060, according to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38689398/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Many treatments have been designed to clear amyloid beta, the sticky protein that builds up in Alzheimer’s brains,” principal investigator and IBEC research professor Giuseppe Battaglia &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2025/10/06/scientists-use-nanoparticles-clear-Alzheimers-brain-toxins-mice/1391759759260/" rel="nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;United Press International&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Some of these can remove the plaques, but that alone hasn’t stopped memory loss or slowed the disease enough.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Our work suggests a different approach: instead of focusing solely on removing what’s already gone wrong inside the brain, we aim to repair the system that keeps the brain healthy in the first place — its blood vessels and protective barrier,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;Particularly exciting: the researchers found that the cognitive improvements in the mice were substantial. A mouse that they said was roughly the equivalent of a 90-year-old human, had “recovered the behavior of a healthy mouse” after receiving the treatment six months prior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“The long-term effect comes from restoring the brain’s vasculature,” Battaglia explained in the statement. “We think it works like a cascade: when toxic species such as amyloid-beta accumulate, disease progresses. But once the vasculature is able to function again, it starts clearing Aβ and other harmful molecules, allowing the whole system to recover its balance.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“What’s remarkable is that our nanoparticles act as a drug and seem to activate a feedback mechanism that brings this clearance pathway back to normal levels,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;The supramolecular drugs reset the brain’s ability to pass amyloid-beta through the blood-brain barrier by mimicking the natural processes that are interrupted by Alzheimer’s. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;By renewing these waste-clearing pathways, the drugs allow levels of the harmful protein to drop — while simultaneously maintaining the brain’s vascular system for improved brain function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“Restoring this barrier improves blood flow, reduces inflammation, and helps the brain recover its balance,” Battaglia told &lt;em&gt;UPI&lt;/em&gt;. “This approach could slow Alzheimer’s progression more effectively by treating one of its earliest and most overlooked causes, the breakdown of the brain’s own defense system.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;However, plenty more research still has to be done before we can trial similar approaches in humans suffering from Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="article-paragraph skip"&gt;“There are many ongoing efforts in animal models to find innovative methods of crossing the BBB to improve efficiency and precision for drug delivery,” Alzheimer’s Association director of scientific engagement Courtney Kloske told &lt;em&gt;UPI&lt;/em&gt;, “but we are still a long way from these technologies being proven safe and effective in humans.”&lt;/p&gt;

							&lt;p data-start="371" data-end="579"&gt;We’ve all been told that mindfulness is the holy grail for managing anxiety. And sure—it helps. Sitting still, focusing on your breath, observing your thoughts without judgment… it sounds great in theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="581" data-end="719"&gt;But if you’ve ever tried to meditate with a racing mind, you know the struggle. Sometimes, stillness actually makes your anxiety louder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="721" data-end="947"&gt;The truth is, mindfulness isn’t for everyone. Some of us need movement, texture, and engagement to calm our minds. And psychologists are increasingly recognizing that anxiety relief often comes from &lt;em data-start="920" data-end="927"&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt;—not just &lt;em data-start="937" data-end="945"&gt;being.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="949" data-end="1144"&gt;That’s where these “weirdly specific” hobbies come in. They don’t just distract you; they regulate your nervous system in ways that mirror mindfulness—but often feel more natural and enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1146" data-end="1286"&gt;So, if sitting in silence isn’t your thing, here are eight activities that can ground you just as deeply (and sometimes more effectively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="1293" data-end="1308"&gt;1) Pottery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1310" data-end="1501"&gt;There’s something deeply grounding about working with clay. It’s sensory, messy, and fully in the moment—everything mindfulness &lt;em data-start="1438" data-end="1445"&gt;tries&lt;/em&gt; to be, but without the pressure to “clear your mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1503" data-end="1801"&gt;Dr. Cathy Malchiodi, a psychologist and expressive arts therapist, explains that tactile art forms like pottery help &lt;a href="https://www.cathymalchiodi.com/resources/expressive-art-therapy-articles-links?.com"&gt;discharge emotional tension&lt;/a&gt; through the body. The rhythmic motion of shaping and smoothing activates the parasympathetic nervous system—the part responsible for rest and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1803" data-end="1999"&gt;When your hands are busy centering clay on a wheel, your brain naturally settles into a calm, focused rhythm. You’re not &lt;em data-start="1924" data-end="1934"&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt; your way out of anxiety; you’re &lt;em data-start="1967" data-end="1976"&gt;feeling&lt;/em&gt; your way through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2001" data-end="2294"&gt;I took a pottery class a few years back after a stressful job transition. I wasn’t great at it—half my bowls collapsed like deflated soufflés—but I didn’t care. My mind was quiet for the first time in months. There’s something humbling about creating something imperfect with your own hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2296" data-end="2464"&gt;That’s the secret: pottery teaches you to release control and embrace imperfection. You don’t need to make something beautiful—you just need to make something &lt;em data-start="2455" data-end="2462"&gt;real.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2471" data-end="2487"&gt;2) Foraging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2489" data-end="2550"&gt;Foraging is part mindfulness, part adventure, part therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2552" data-end="2781"&gt;When you’re wandering through the woods searching for edible mushrooms or wild herbs, your mind can’t afford to spiral. It’s fully absorbed in observation—the color of a cap, the smell of damp soil, the sound of birds overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2783" data-end="3036"&gt;Psychologists refer to this as &lt;a href="https://positivepsychology.com/attention-restoration-theory/?.com"&gt;attention restoration theory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em data-start="2814" data-end="2845"&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; It suggests that time spent in natural, lightly engaging environments helps your prefrontal cortex recover from overstimulation. In plain English: nature resets your brain’s stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3038" data-end="3182"&gt;There’s also something primal and grounding about foraging—it reconnects you to a sense of agency and survival that modern life tends to dull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3184" data-end="3531"&gt;I joined a local foraging group last spring. I’ll be honest, I was mostly in it for the excuse to get outside and meet people. But after a few hikes, I noticed something unexpected: I was sleeping better, thinking clearer, and feeling calmer during the week. My therapist later said, “That’s your nervous system responding to rhythm and nature.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3533" data-end="3619"&gt;Turns out, you don’t have to meditate under a tree—you just have to walk among them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3626" data-end="3646"&gt;3) Birdwatching&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3648" data-end="3809"&gt;Birdwatching might sound like a hobby for retirees with binoculars and floppy hats—but it’s quietly one of the most effective anti-anxiety practices out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3811" data-end="4067"&gt;A 2022 study published in &lt;em data-start="189" data-end="209"&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; found that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/10/221027093319.htm?.com"&gt;seeing or hearing birds&lt;/a&gt; was associated with noticeable boosts in mental well-being lasting up to eight hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4069" data-end="4305"&gt;Here’s why: birding trains your brain to shift from rumination to observation. Instead of looping on anxious thoughts, you’re scanning for movement, listening for calls, noticing details. It’s mindfulness that comes with a soundtrack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4307" data-end="4490"&gt;There’s also a subtle joy in delayed gratification. You wait, you watch, and suddenly—there it is. A flash of red, a flutter of wings, a moment that pulls you entirely into the now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4492" data-end="4701"&gt;A friend of mine started birdwatching after her therapist suggested it for social anxiety. She said, “It’s the first time I can stand in silence and not feel awkward.” That line has stuck with me ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4708" data-end="4730"&gt;4) Jigsaw puzzles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4732" data-end="4837"&gt;Mindfulness tells you to “focus on one thing at a time.” Jigsaw puzzles make that happen automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4839" data-end="5165"&gt;The repetitive motion of sorting pieces and fitting them together triggers a state psychologists call “flow”—the same deep focus artists and athletes experience when they’re completely immersed in an activity. In this state, your brain releases dopamine, which improves mood and concentration while lowering stress hormones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5167" data-end="5443"&gt;A longitudinal trial called PACE (Jigsaw Puzzles As Cognitive Enrichment) showed that solving jigsaw puzzles strongly &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/aging-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2018.00299/full?.com"&gt;engages a variety of cognitive skills&lt;/a&gt; (spatial perception, mental rotation, working memory, flexibility, reasoning) and is correlated with better visuospatial cognition—especially in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5445" data-end="5648"&gt;During lockdown, I rediscovered puzzles as a way to decompress. What started as “something to do” became my evening ritual. I noticed I was calmer, sleeping better, and far less tempted to doom-scroll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5650" data-end="5852"&gt;There’s a sense of progress in puzzles that’s hard to find in daily life. Piece by piece, you remind yourself that order can emerge from chaos—and that’s a comforting metaphor for anyone with anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5859" data-end="5876"&gt;5) Gardening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5878" data-end="6004"&gt;As someone who spends her weekends elbow-deep in soil, I can say with confidence: gardening is therapy disguised as a chore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6006" data-end="6146"&gt;You dig, plant, water, prune. You get sun on your face and dirt under your nails. It’s tactile and sensory—two things anxious minds crave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6148" data-end="6403"&gt;Researchers at the University of Florida found that gardening activities &lt;a href="https://biotech.ufl.edu/gardening-can-cultivate-better-mental-health/?.com"&gt;significantly reduced stress&lt;/a&gt;, anxiety, and depression in participants, even for healthy people who’d never gardened before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6405" data-end="6641"&gt;And here’s the fun part: soil contains &lt;em data-start="6444" data-end="6466"&gt;Mycobacterium vaccae&lt;/em&gt;, a natural microbe shown to boost serotonin levels—the same neurotransmitter targeted by antidepressants. So, yes, you can literally cultivate happiness from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6643" data-end="6935"&gt;One of my favorite moments each week is checking on my tomato plants at sunrise. The stillness, the smell of earth, the faint sound of bees—everything slows down. It’s not about productivity or results. It’s about remembering you’re part of something bigger and steadier than your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6942" data-end="6963"&gt;6) Improv comedy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6965" data-end="7112"&gt;At first glance, improv sounds like the last thing someone with anxiety should do. Standing in front of strangers with no script? Nightmare fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7114" data-end="7321"&gt;But psychologists are starting to use improv principles in therapy for exactly that reason. It’s controlled unpredictability. You learn to adapt, think on your feet, and—most importantly—laugh at yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7523" data-end="7757"&gt;Every time you say “yes, and…” you’re reinforcing flexibility and presence. There’s no time to overthink. You have to respond instinctively, which trains your brain to handle anxiety-provoking situations with humor instead of panic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7759" data-end="8024"&gt;I tried an improv class once at a friend’s urging. I was nervous beyond belief, but halfway through, something shifted. Everyone was laughing at themselves, failing cheerfully, and cheering each other on. It was liberating. I left lighter than I’d felt in months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8026" data-end="8132"&gt;It reminded me that joy isn’t the absence of anxiety—it’s the ability to hold it loosely and still play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8139" data-end="8161"&gt;7) Model building&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8163" data-end="8301"&gt;Whether it’s assembling a miniature train set, crafting tiny houses, or designing scale models, this hobby has a strangely calming pull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8303" data-end="8592"&gt;Model building demands attention to detail, but not perfection. You measure, glue, paint, and adjust, entering what psychologist Mihály Csíkszentmihályi famously called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psychology%29?.com"&gt;“the flow state.”&lt;/a&gt; In this zone, time blurs, and your sense of self quiets down—a physiological parallel to meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8594" data-end="8795"&gt;For people with anxiety, this kind of structured engagement provides safety and predictability. You control small, manageable outcomes, which helps restore a sense of mastery when life feels chaotic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8797" data-end="9102"&gt;A retired engineer once told me that model shipbuilding “stills the noise.” I didn’t get it until I tried building a wooden miniature greenhouse last winter. The process was slow, precise, and oddly absorbing. When I finally snapped the roof into place, I felt a calm I hadn’t realized I’d been missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9104" data-end="9189"&gt;Sometimes what we need isn’t less stimulation—it’s the &lt;em data-start="9159" data-end="9171"&gt;right kind&lt;/em&gt; of stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="9196" data-end="9217"&gt;8) Trail running&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9219" data-end="9342"&gt;I might be biased here—I’ve been a trail runner for years—but it’s the single most reliable thing I’ve found for anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9344" data-end="9560"&gt;Unlike road running, trail running forces full-body awareness. You’re scanning roots, adjusting pace, balancing on uneven terrain. There’s no space for mental chatter because your brain is busy keeping you upright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9562" data-end="9881"&gt;Psychologists call this embodied mindfulness — a form of movement-based presence. In fact, a systematic review of rhythmic physical activity (dance, walking, etc.) showed &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/22/7084?.com"&gt;meaningful reductions in anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and improvements in quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9883" data-end="10066"&gt;I’ve had moments mid-run where I feel so in sync with my body and surroundings that everything else fades away—the deadlines, the worries, the what-ifs. Just breath, ground, rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10068" data-end="10190"&gt;And honestly, that’s what mindfulness aims for anyway: the freedom of presence. Trail running just gets me there faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="10197" data-end="10216"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10218" data-end="10381"&gt;Here’s the truth: mindfulness isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. For some of us, the quiet feels claustrophobic. For others, the stillness invites overthinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10383" data-end="10475"&gt;But that doesn’t mean we can’t experience its benefits—we just need different doorways in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10477" data-end="10677"&gt;Pottery, puzzles, foraging, gardening, even improv—they’re all mindfulness in disguise. They give your hands something to do, your senses something to engage with, and your mind a break from itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10679" data-end="10783"&gt;If sitting in silence doesn’t soothe you, stop forcing it. There’s no single “right” way to find calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="10785" data-end="10913"&gt;Because sometimes the best way to quiet the mind is to give it something joyful to do—something beautifully, weirdly specific.&lt;/p&gt;
						&lt;/div&gt;
