			&lt;p&gt;Noticing somebody fidgeting can be distracting. Vexing. Even excruciating. But why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to research, the stressful sensations caused by seeing others fidget are an incredibly common psychological phenomenon, affecting as many as one in three people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Called &lt;a href="https://www.misokinesia.ca"&gt;misokinesia&lt;/a&gt; – meaning 'hatred of movements' – this strange phenomenon had been little studied by scientists until recent years, but was noted in the context of a related condition, &lt;a href="a-super-sensitive-brain-connection-could-be-why-some-people-can-t-stand-certain-sounds"&gt;misophonia&lt;/a&gt;: a disorder where people become &lt;a href="can-t-stand-the-sound-of-people-chewing-blame-your-brain-science-misophonia"&gt;irritated upon hearing certain repetitious sounds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misokinesia is somewhat similar, but the triggers are generally more visual, rather than sound-related, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"[Misokinesia] is defined as a strong negative affective or emotional response to the sight of someone else's small and repetitive movements, such as seeing someone mindlessly fidgeting with a hand or foot," a team of researchers, led by first author and psychologist Sumeet Jaswal, then at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Canada, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96430-4"&gt;explained in a study published in 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Yet surprisingly, scientific research on the topic is lacking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144167" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144167" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nervous_fidget.jpg" alt="hands fidgeting" class="wp-image-144167 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nervous_fidget.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/nervous_fidget-600x370.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144167" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Misokenesia creates strong emotional responses on seeing small, repetitive movements. (PeopleImages/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To improve our understanding, Jawal and fellow researchers conducted what they said was the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96430-4"&gt;"first in-depth scientific exploration"&lt;/a&gt; of misokinesia – and the results indicate that heightened sensitivity to fidgeting is something a large number of people have to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across a series of experiments involving over 4,100 participants, the researchers measured the prevalence of misokinesia in a cohort of university students and people from the general population, assessing the impacts it had upon them, and exploring why the sensations might manifest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We found that approximately one-third self-reported some degree of misokinesia sensitivity to the repetitive, fidgeting behaviors of others as encountered in their daily lives," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-96430-4"&gt;the researchers explained&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results support the conclusion that misokinesia sensitivity is not a phenomenon restricted to clinical populations, but rather, is a basic and heretofore under-recognized social challenge shared by many in the wider, general population."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the analysis, misokinesia sometimes goes hand in hand with the sound-sensitivity of misophonia, but not always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon seems to vary significantly among individuals, with some people reporting only low sensitivity to fidgeting stimuli, while others feel highly affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They are negatively impacted emotionally and experience reactions such as anger, anxiety, or frustration as well as reduced enjoyment in social situations, work, and learning environments," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2021/08/31/do-you-hate-seeing-people-fidget-new-ubc-research-says-youre-not-alone/"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; UBC psychologist Todd Handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Some even pursue fewer social activities because of the condition.".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Handy began researching misokinesia after a partner told him he was a fidgeter and confessed she felt stress when he fidgeted (or anybody else for that matter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"As a visual cognitive neuroscientist, this really piqued my interest to find out what is happening in the brain," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2021/08/31/do-you-hate-seeing-people-fidget-new-ubc-research-says-youre-not-alone/"&gt;Handy said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the million-dollar question stands: Why do we find fidgeting so annoying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, the researchers ran tests to see if people's misokinesia might originate in heightened visual-attentional sensitivities, amounting to an inability to block out distracting events occurring in their visual periphery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results based on early experiments were inconclusive on that front, with the researchers finding no firm evidence that reflexive visual attentional mechanisms substantively contribute to misokinesia sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we're still only at the outset then of exploring where misokinesia may spring from on a cognitive level, the researchers do have some hypothetical leads for future research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One possibility we want to explore is that their '&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron"&gt;mirror neurons&lt;/a&gt;' are at play," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2021/08/31/do-you-hate-seeing-people-fidget-new-ubc-research-says-youre-not-alone/"&gt;Jaswal said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These neurons activate when we move but they also activate when we see others move… For example, when you see someone get hurt, you may wince as well, as their pain is mirrored in your own brain."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By extension, it's possible that misokinesia-prone people might be unconsciously empathizing with the psychology of fidgeters. And not in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A reason that people fidget is because they're anxious or nervous so when individuals who suffer from misokinesia see someone fidgeting, they may mirror it and feel anxious or nervous as well," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2021/08/31/do-you-hate-seeing-people-fidget-new-ubc-research-says-youre-not-alone/"&gt;Jaswal said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to whether that's what's really going on here with misokinesia, only further research into the phenomenon will be able to say for sure. A &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0313169"&gt;follow-up study&lt;/a&gt; conducted by Jaswal in 2024 on 21 volunteers found the condition may be linked to challenges in disengaging from a stimulus, rather than about the initial distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing is certain though. From the results seen here, it's clear that this unusual phenomenon is much more usual than we realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"To those who are suffering from misokinesia, you are not alone," &lt;a href="https://news.ubc.ca/2021/08/31/do-you-hate-seeing-people-fidget-new-ubc-research-says-youre-not-alone/"&gt;Handy said&lt;/a&gt;. "Your challenge is common and it's real."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings are reported in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-96430-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in September 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Some ideas revolve around chemical changes in specific neurons, while others focus on structural shifts among brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tcd.ie/research/profiles/?profile=tryan6"&gt;Dr. Tomás Ryan&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.tcd.ie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Trinity College Dublin&lt;/a&gt; is among the neuroscientists who have explored these questions by tracking cells involved in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/memory-isnt-only-stored-in-our-brains-other-cells-can-remember-too/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;learning&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)01512-9"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; suggest memory formation hinges on connections between groups of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-023-02137-5"&gt;engram cells&lt;/a&gt;, which are neurons thought to capture and store distinct experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-memories-become-linked"&gt;How memories become linked&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe each experience leaves a pattern of brain cell activation that can be switched on later. To see this process in action, neuroscientists tracked two sets of engram cells, each tied to a different memory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They discovered that when one set of cells was reactivated, the other set sometimes lit up too, as if the memories had become linked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This idea runs counter to the old notion that an individual neuron stores an entire memory. Instead, the memory might be in the connections these &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sleep-rewires-the-brain-to-strengthen-memories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cells&lt;/a&gt; build and reshape over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such structural rearrangements help us handle new information without losing old experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-which-brain-cells-store-memories"&gt;Which brain cells store memories?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Memory engram cells are groups of brain cells that, activated by specific experiences, change themselves to incorporate and thereby hold information in our brain,” said &lt;a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8365-2762" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Clara Ortega-de San Luis&lt;/a&gt;, Postdoctoral Research Fellow and lead author on the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She and her colleagues monitored how similar or related memories were stored across different brain areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They used genetic techniques to label neurons that fired for one event, then watched how those same &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/smartphones-are-teaching-us-how-to-supercharge-our-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;neurons&lt;/a&gt; responded to a second event that felt related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One major clue came from measuring how well these labeled neurons made new links with cells that were tied to older, separate experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optogenetics, a method that turns cells on or off with light, let them test whether blocking these newly formed links disrupted the memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-one-protein-shapes-memory"&gt;How one protein shapes memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A specific protein, &lt;a href="https://molecularbrain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13041-019-0520-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PSD-95&lt;/a&gt;, emerged as a gatekeeper of these engram cell connections. This protein sits at nerve cell junctions called &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/24790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;synapses&lt;/a&gt; and helps anchor receptor molecules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the team lowered the amount of PSD-95 in the neurons storing a given memory, these connections behaved differently. Under certain conditions, the memory seemed to linger even when researchers tried to dampen it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That persistence hints at how the brain can hang on to memories that we might assume should fade. It also hints at why a shortage or disruption of PSD-95 could derail normal learning &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/why-memories-close-in-time-feel-connected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;patterns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brain-cells-build-on-old-memories"&gt;Brain cells build on old memories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work taps into a broader shift in neuroscience. Rather than focusing on single cells, many researchers now examine how multiple cells form networks that hold our daily experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using cutting-edge genetic tagging, scientists can identify where new links are happening and whether these connections are essential for recalling the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/forgetting-things-is-a-natural-part-of-the-memory-process/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the previous studies mapped separate steps: encoding a memory, storing it, then reactivating it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This project took it one step further by showing how the brain might slot fresh information into an existing network, so the old memory is updated instead of replaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-these-findings-matter"&gt;Why these findings matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have debated how new learning manages not to overwrite older memories in the same region of the brain. According to Dr. Ryan, “we should search for information ‘between’ cells.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This view suggests memories are not locked inside one specific location but scattered as connections that can be modified. If true, it may explain how we learn quickly from everyday life without dismantling what we already know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therapies could one day target the proteins that enable these shifting connections. If molecules like PSD-95 shape synapses to store a memory, then changing them might help reframe harmful memories tied to fear or trauma, though more studies are needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-brain-cells-shape-daily-memory"&gt;How brain cells shape daily memory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Memory isn’t purely academic. Our daily routines demand constant learning, whether it’s recalling names, navigating busy streets, or picking up a new hobby. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding how the brain cells keep all that information flexible, yet stable, offers hope for tackling age-related memory issues or conditions that affect learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional work in the field has shown that certain neurons can take on multiple roles depending on the situation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those roles often shift over time, especially when new experiences pile up. By homing in on the connections, scientists add a piece to the puzzle of how these cells adapt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-this-research-could-lead"&gt;Where this research could lead&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unraveling the complicated dance among engram cells might eventually guide how we teach, treat memory disorders, or support mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If wiring changes are at the core of learning, there might be clever ways to prompt healthy rearrangements in people struggling with conditions like post-traumatic stress or depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study gives a peek into that process. It reveals a fragile, but critical, balance at the heart of learning: strengthen certain neural links for new knowledge, but keep enough structure so older skills and memories remain intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)01512-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 20:23:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxNYjY2WTNHQjBzSUJOSllETy10Zk1TMUlocWVyTW9tV184QlJYTHdxOTRubEFlNXhhRWJvd0Z5aGtqN29yeC1mTmVDRXNtdXUzS3AxYWtHN2NyaU94T0hHR2dMa2Z6cTBNOXAxTEVtSi1MSDFUdGFhY3ZSdmowMHM3aFpwTVAwVDRJbzFBY2RvMVdibXJ3YWxCZXhHN2ZpMmpfMVkxTw</guid></item><item><title>Second child died from measles-related causes in West Texas, where cases are nearing 500 - AP News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxQNFpVY1QwMkh5NEZZRUYzVVJWTmRucXRKY2FxYi1CYnd0djlmSTVPVlN5ekMxYnRsWDJhaWFoMXNjWncxbjZNQTBnQzU5VThhMlRtMzJ5MGZDNDlZUFpib01BcHdsZEtZTXBnMGxtc3lhNWFPTVFUdDR0ZUl1OUlTdDRPWTJaTk1VSmhRdFpqTFpRTGlLR1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AP News</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 17:50:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxQNFpVY1QwMkh5NEZZRUYzVVJWTmRucXRKY2FxYi1CYnd0djlmSTVPVlN5ekMxYnRsWDJhaWFoMXNjWncxbjZNQTBnQzU5VThhMlRtMzJ5MGZDNDlZUFpib01BcHdsZEtZTXBnMGxtc3lhNWFPTVFUdDR0ZUl1OUlTdDRPWTJaTk1VSmhRdFpqTFpRTGlLR1E</guid></item><item><title>California town reports third fatality related to rare virus linked to death of Gene Hackman’s wife - KTLA</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMizAFBVV95cUxQQmRUZWpOT3VidXpmNDZYOUNMM0o3RVI5RkVJOGVrZ3ZVa3Q5dWdnY0R5Zzh6c0JxckVtWnQ3eDU5c2hMXzZ1dk5XZGNmalUxdnZHRjhQVmpIZHh5ZlA2bjVDZkQwUmt4NjNmcHhWbW5FUGFWMU5PZlFuek1kRGhsY0FhQ2VmUG9YVnRGbzYtOEtxbENyODJoZ2dqdWhDd1hUemxrZG9CVHZLN0lEcThRVm13R2NfZzRzOXF1VGJqX081NFhsd1ZZTm1kSjbSAdIBQVVfeXFMTmU2cDBCRnl4SzhvVmdudzdaUnFOS0JFYVhhTTZNVF84eXJLYldTV2p1eGxBYnl0a0otVEtIY1BPTmY4d0hCa1ZENmRIOGwzbkk5N3NwWnE2VnJPaTVhcXZhLURseVl6NkNYSElIU3ZxcGVsbjkyMGJfMlFFYUxjX0VmVzNfRTVxV1B2Q0ZtQ24yelM0QVgzNjB0blluN0NsM29mRWtPRDUxcnBmTVlHQWY1ODYxVEswVlpaSzQ1Q0diLTFIeU5TaDBqTlBzTEFsbzN3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content article-body rich-text "&gt;
		
		
&lt;p&gt;A third person in the remote California town of Mammoth Lakes has died of hantavirus, the sometimes-fatal illness that authorities say Betsy Arakawa, the wife of actor Gene Hackman, &lt;a href="https://ktla.com/news/nationworld/officials-to-give-update-on-gene-hackman-betsy-arakawa-death-investigation-what-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;died of earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/monohealthdepartment/posts/pfbid0zW43aGawceHQdXW7VDi1HTPgyaTXSf8V5W1gaKam1YtJHT2FaLGLXmzRkDhWZ7rbl?__cft__[0]=AZV5uoqSXoyei-EN9EzNxlf3ZlmfcVqaD2E_auZIlaJKkXI5XFZnnXW8F1uiX7BLt1OqRI9uDTAiFIMWqg_8tH9YBhZSJNyyMkBmvT83wwkDCqkbghWOBOCtFfWgLxJsJ5PTTHXPhUR19Llc4AHNlBx3y13HW2ebKci22t_ZowWUFAXdWbAQxAulNAO2AmRu7FA&amp;amp;__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; shared Thursday, Mono County Health &amp;amp; Human Services confirmed that a young adult had died from the illness. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We don’t have a clear sense of where this young adult may have contracted the virus,” Dr. Tom Boo, the county’s public health officer said. “The home had no evidence of mouse activity. We observed some mice in the workplace, which is not unusual for indoor spaces this time of year in Mammoth Lakes. We haven’t identified any other activities in the weeks before illness that would have increased this person’s exposure to mice or their droppings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="88fw2hsm" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/nexstar_media_wire/5183395-gene-hackmans-wife-betsy-arakawa-died-from-hantavirus-but-what-is-it/?ipid=promo-link-block1"&gt;Hantavirus&lt;/a&gt;, found throughout the world, is spread by contact with rodents or their urine or feces. It does not spread between people. There is no specific treatment or cure, but early medical attention can increase the chance of survival. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An infection can rapidly progress and become life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“It really starts like the flu: body aches, feeling poorly overall,” said Dr. Sonja Bartolome of UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. “Early in the illness, you really may not be able to tell the difference between hantavirus and having the flu.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The virus can cause a severe and sometimes deadly lung infection called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, according to the CDC. All three deaths in Mono County were connected to this syndrome, which is spread by deer mice, health officials said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Boo said deer mouse numbers are believed to be high this year in the Mammoth Lakes area, noting that “an increase in indoor mice elevates the risk of Hantavirus exposure.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Boo noted that of the three deaths reported in the county so far, they do not believe that any of them “engaged in activities typically associated with exposure, such as cleaning out poorly ventilated indoor areas or outbuildings with a lot of mouse waste.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Instead, these folks may have been exposed during normal daily activities, either in the home or the workplace.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the press release from Mono County Health &amp;amp; Human Services, all three residents began to feel ill in February. In all three cases, “there was some evidence of mice” in their workplaces “but no major infestations were found,” while one had “numerous mice in their home.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One person had been vacuuming “in one or more areas where investigators later found mouse droppings,” the department noted, adding that vacuuming “can aerosolize the virus through the air and lead to infection.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid the germ is to minimize contact with rodents and their droppings. Use protective gloves and a bleach solution for cleaning up rodent droppings. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC began tracking the virus after a 1993 outbreak in the Four Corners region — the area where Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah meet. Ever since, the majority of U.S. cases have been reported in western states. That includes &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/data-research/cases/index.html"&gt;78 cases&lt;/a&gt; reported in California between 1993 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="civic-science-article-container civic-science-more-14 civic-is-mr3" id="civsci-id-civsci-id-305934525" data-civicscience-widget="3f127ebd-287e-0b64-a901-d55ec286348a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While hantavirus is not uncommon in Mono County — there have been 27 cases reported since 1993 — cases are typically seen during late spring or summer, making the three cases reported already this year “strikingly unusual.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prior to the cases confirmed this year, Mono County had not seen a hantavirus infection since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hantavirus is not spread between people, health officials said. Roughly one-third of people who do become infected die.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last month, New Mexico authorities confirmed that Arakawa — &lt;a href="https://www.krqe.com/news/new-mexico/search-warrant-reveals-details-surrounding-the-deaths-of-gene-hackman-his-wife-and-dog-in-santa-fe/"&gt;found dead in the home she shared with her husband&lt;/a&gt;, Hackman — had died from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Authorities have not said how Arakawa, 65, may have become infected. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yourcentralvalley.com/news/u-s-world/judge-to-consider-request-to-withhold-investigation-records-related-to-deaths-of-gene-hackman-betsy-arakawa/"&gt;Investigators determined&lt;/a&gt; Hackman, 95, died of heart disease with complications of Alzheimer’s days after his wife died. Their dog, Zinna, was found dead of starvation and dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;

He just didn’t have anything concrete to tell them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Until recently, the answer was, ‘I don’t know,’ ” said Dr. Pastuszak, who is now a urologist at the University of Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;So he started looking for an answer. Cannabis is legal for either medicinal or recreational purposes in all but 11 states and was used at least once by 52.5 million Americans in 2021, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cdc.gov/cannabis/data-research/facts-stats/index.html" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Yet because it remains illegal under federal law, it’s hard to study, and its long term health effects are still poorly understood, said Dr. Omer Raheem, a urologist at the Cleveland Clinic who practices in the United States and Abu Dhabi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Even so, when it comes to the male reproductive system, some effects of cannabis are becoming clear. By looking at 48 studies from around the world, Dr. Pastuszak &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7385722/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;found in 2019&lt;/a&gt; that cannabis products &lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; harm a man’s chances of conceiving children. Finally, he feels, he has an answer for his patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“THC, certainly in smoked form, can impact semen,” Dr. Pastuszak said, and therefore damage male fertility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

The Hollywood star and his wife were found dead in their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, on Feb. 26. While Hackman is believed to have died from “hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with Alzheimer’s disease as a significant contributory factor," his wife died from a rare illness. Arakawa, who was 65 years old, died from hantavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The virus, spread by rodents, can cause fatigue, fever, muscle aches, coughing and shortness of breath, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In severe cases, like Arakawa's, it can be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Tragically, three people in the town of Mammoth Lakes, California have died from the same illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gene Hackman and Betsy Arakawa during Gene Hackman Sighting at Spago - September 5, 1986 at Spago in West Hollywood, California, United States.

			&lt;p&gt;The benefits of getting fish in your diet are well known (it's in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-mediterranean-lifestyle-really-can-help-you-live-longer-study-shows"&gt;the Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, for example), but &lt;span&gt;mercury&lt;/span&gt; poisoning &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/mercury-in-fish"&gt;remains a concern&lt;/a&gt;. Now, scientists have figured out how to cut levels of &lt;span&gt;mercury&lt;/span&gt; in fish by up to 35 percent with a tweak to how it's packaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences and Chalmers University of Technology experimented with adding the amino acid cysteine to canned tuna – one of the types that can have &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/mercury-in-tuna"&gt;the most mercury in it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When tuna is immersed in water containing cysteine, the novel solution removed 25 to 35 percent of the &lt;span&gt;mercury&lt;/span&gt; from the fish, according to lab tests. The more fish flesh that was in contact with the solution, the more &lt;span&gt;mercury&lt;/span&gt; was taken out into the liquid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156736" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156736" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MercuryChart.jpg" alt="Mercury chart" class="wp-image-156736 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MercuryChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MercuryChart-511x415.jpg 511w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/MercuryChart-600x487.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156736" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers tested different types of fish and different concentrations of cysteine. (Strachowski et al., &lt;em&gt;Global Challenges&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cysteine was picked for the solution because of the way &lt;span&gt;mercury&lt;/span&gt; strongly binds to it – which is how it's able to build up in fish in the first place – and following on from a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2024.135562"&gt;previous study&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;span&gt;mercury&lt;/span&gt; removal by the same researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We believed this would allow some of the &lt;span&gt;mercury&lt;/span&gt; to be drawn out and instead bind to the solution and be discarded," &lt;a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/current/news/life-mercury-content-in-tuna-can-be-reduced-with-new-packaging-solution/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; chemist Przemysław Strachowski, from Chalmers University of Technology. "Further research is needed to take care of the removed &lt;span&gt;mercury&lt;/span&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you've been eating fish without any knowledge of any potential &lt;span&gt;mercury&lt;/span&gt; contamination, don't worry: you're &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/11-things-people-think-are-terrible-for-your-diet-that-actually-aren-t"&gt;unlikely to be consuming enough&lt;/a&gt; of it for there to be a danger, though &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.colsurfa.2024.135562"&gt;it's recommended&lt;/a&gt; that pregnant women and young children only eat a limited amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In most cases, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/nordic-diet-provides-health-benefits-even-without-weight-loss-blood-tests-show"&gt;health benefits&lt;/a&gt; of eating fish outweigh the potential health risks – though finding a way to reduce &lt;span&gt;mercury&lt;/span&gt; levels in fish through the way the food is packaged would certainly &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1006876"&gt;reduce those risks&lt;/a&gt; even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The beauty of this type of packaging is that it is active while the product is on the shelf," &lt;a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/current/news/life-mercury-content-in-tuna-can-be-reduced-with-new-packaging-solution/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Strachowski. "No additional production steps would be needed if a method like this were used industrially."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The application of our results could increase the safety margin for fish consumption."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no noticeable changes in the appearance or smell of the fish samples treated with cysteine in the study, and &lt;span&gt;mercury&lt;/span&gt; removal continued for up to two weeks. No extra additives were required for the solution to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's going to take further research to turn this into a practical option for fish storage, but the early signs are promising – and the team thinks the methods outlined could be improved in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our study shows that there are alternative approaches to addressing &lt;span&gt;mercury&lt;/span&gt; contamination in tuna, rather than just limiting consumption," &lt;a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/current/news/life-mercury-content-in-tuna-can-be-reduced-with-new-packaging-solution/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; food scientist Mehdi Abdollahi, from Chalmers University of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our goal is to improve food safety and contribute to enhanced human health, as well as to better utilize food that is currently under certain restrictions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/gch2.202400161"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Global Challenges&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It can develop into hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a lung disease that may kill about 38 percent of people who develop respiratory symptoms, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hantavirus/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4MXKSFBXMRHPFPHBVIX4QOTCVE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Symptoms of the infection, which is generally not transmitted person to person, typically start to show one to eight weeks after the first contact with the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AWTPQIESSJCDXBTSCNHB7GAIJY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Hantavirus is rare but not unusual, and deer mice — the only source of the virus in the area — are widespread in the Eastern Sierra region, according to county health officials.

It is the second confirmed measles death in a decade in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The first was an &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/26/us/texas-measles-outbreak-death.html" title=""&gt;unvaccinated child who died in West Texas&lt;/a&gt; in February.

Kennedy, the nation’s health secretary, has faced intense criticism for his handling of the outbreak. A prominent vaccine skeptic, he has offered &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/health/measles-vaccination-texas-kennedy.html" title=""&gt;muted support for vaccination&lt;/a&gt; and has &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/04/health/texas-measles-outbreak-kennedy.html" title=""&gt;emphasized untested treatments&lt;/a&gt; for measles, like cod liver oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;According to doctors in Texas, Mr. Kennedy’s endorsement of alternative treatments has contributed to patients delaying critical care and ingesting &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/health/measles-kennedy-vitamin-a.html" title=""&gt;toxic levels&lt;/a&gt; of vitamin A.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-3"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Experts also fear that the Trump administration’s recent decisions to dismantle international public health safeguards and pull funding from local health departments have made &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/health/measles-outbreaks-texas-kennedy.html" title=""&gt;large, multistate outbreaks more likely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Measles is one of the most contagious pathogens. The virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person has left the room and spreads when a sick person breathes, coughs or sneezes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Within a week or two of being exposed, those who are infected may develop a high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes. Within a few days, a telltale rash breaks out as flat, red spots on the face and then spreads down the neck and torso to the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In most cases, these symptoms resolve in a few weeks. But in rare cases, the virus causes pneumonia, making it difficult for patients, but especially children, to get oxygen into their lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-5"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It may also cause brain swelling, which can leave lasting problems, like blindness, deafness and intellectual disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;For every 1,000 children who get measles, one or two will die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Symptoms such as memory loss are often misinterpreted as normal aging signs. However, your sleep patterns could also be impacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Alzheimer's Society has explained that those suffering from dementia may encounter specific sleep-related issues. The charity stated on its website: “A person with dementia experiences physical changes in their brain because of their condition. These changes can affect how much, and how well they sleep."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charity continued: “A person with dementia may have problems with sleeping at night, and may sleep more during the day. They may find it difficult to get to sleep or they may wake up in the night. The person you care for may not feel well rested when they wake up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Over time, if these problems happen often, poor sleep may make the symptoms of dementia worse. You may find this difficult to cope with.For a person with dementia, getting enough sleep can be a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sleeping well can be difficult for a person aged over 55, as the parts of the brain that control sleep may not work as well. An older person is likely to go to sleep earlier and may have difficulty sleeping through the night as much as they used to.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the society, a person with dementia might:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Have difficulty getting to sleep&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wake up several times during the night&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sleep less deeply&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sleep for less time overall&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The society points out that a person with dementia might experience increased daytime sleepiness and trouble sleeping at night. "This process can start to happen even before a person has dementia, or if they have mild cognitive impairment (MCI)," the charity noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking study in the journal Neurology suggests that your sleep patterns could be an early indicator of dementia risk. The research indicates that individuals who feel excessively sleepy during the day and may indulge in "excessive" napping could face twice the likelihood of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this five-year study, 733 participants were divided into three distinct groups:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stable sleep (SS) - stable or slightly improved sleep, which 321 women (43.8%) demonstrated&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Declining nighttime sleep (DNS) - decreases in nighttime sleep quality and duration, moderate increases in napping, and worsening circadian rest-activity rhythms (RARs), which 256 women (34.9%) demonstrated&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increasing sleepiness (IS) - large increases in both daytime and nighttime sleep duration and quality, as well as worsening circadian RARs, which 156 women (21.3%) demonstrated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;After five years, researchers assessed whether the participants had normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, or dementia, using various neuropsychological tests, physician diagnoses, or admission to residential nursing home care as benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among women in their 80s, 164 (22.4%) developed mild cognitive impairment and 93 (12.7%) went on to develop dementia. Notably, women categorized as having increasing sleepiness were found to have about double the risk of dementia compared to those with stable sleep patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mantis-recommender-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors concluded: "Among community-dwelling women in their 80s, those with increasing 24-hour sleepiness over five years had doubled dementia risk during that time. Change in multidimensional 24-hour sleep-wake activity may serve as an early marker or risk factor for dementia in oldest old women."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text-description"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent research has shed light on the connection between sleep patterns and dementia risk. A 2016 study in the Alzheimer's and Dementia journal found that both too much and too little sleep could heighten the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthering these findings, a 2021 study published in Nature Communications revealed a link between shorter sleep duration in middle age and an increased risk of dementia. The NHS outlines several "common" early signs of dementia, emphasizing the importance of consulting with a doctor if you or someone you know is exhibiting symptoms of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Express US</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQRHZqd0FqbFlWX3h0YW1LSHVNbFJvVGVWTkxLMVc4cU9XV1lraTZPUHF4eVdYMUY3OXdqNDhkeUJLNTZtSmRrZ2ZPcmtvNlRKeVd4eEN5c3o2RnNqR3g4dXpUWEJyN0pLSjZmUHpIcl93Yi00aTFvUGg5MUdPVWFHR1hGVWNnUk1QUFVoZjN5XzZSS0Q4WlA2akk3bjTSAaIBQVVfeXFMTk9uUXJmWDZldWpWMjJnZll4XzBBQmx0QU9OWFpOY3ZyU2kxVnU5TnpiSHBfbVpROXBvUkJXblZydXNtUHVQQm5CcVBybGpBWG5WY2NfX0FfcmdQcUc2NWhZd2N6TGZuNnN0SlBtcEFyRVluWkV0OTZYR3NHcDdZdmN6aWRZUFpoVF9xRTZRU1VZVWZFNmJOeHdqQzVIUmM3TnJ3</guid></item><item><title>How does marital status impact dementia risk?

However, the incidence of pregnancy-associated cancer (PAC) has &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542454824000109" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gradually increased;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:6;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;gradually increased&lt;/a&gt; in recent decades. “As women are having children at older ages, cancer diagnoses are becoming more common,” &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1" class="link " href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/elena-ratner/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Elena Ratner;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:7;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Dr. Elena Ratner&lt;/a&gt;, a gynecologic oncologist at Yale Cancer Center, tells Yahoo Life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That said, diagnosing cancer during pregnancy can be especially challenging, Ratner notes. “Imaging is more limited, and hormone levels during pregnancy can make breasts feel lumpy,” she explains. “Women commonly feel fatigued during pregnancy, which can mask symptoms of cancers like leukemia or lymphoma.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Pregnancy also makes cancer treatment complex and highly individualized, Cohen says. “It’s the patient’s journey,” he says, emphasizing the need to consider the wishes of the mother and her loved ones. Decisions are made by weighing risks to both mother and baby, factoring in the cancer diagnosis, gestational age and concerns about the cancer’s spread. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all approach,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s a situation that forces women to navigate the challenges of cancer during one of the most joyful, yet vulnerable, times of their lives. It’s also something the women below — all of them now cancer-free — have experienced firsthand. Here’s what it’s like to be diagnosed while pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="i-was-very-focused-on-what-everything-would-mean-for-the-baby"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘I was very focused on what everything would mean for the baby’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Laura Pearson was pregnant with her second child when she discovered a pea-size lump in her breast on the day of her 20-week routine scan. “I didn’t have any pain or anything obvious other than the lump,” Pearson, who lives in the U.K., tells Yahoo Life. But a subsequent ultrasound and biopsy confirmed that the then 35-year-old had breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Being pregnant meant considering her treatment options carefully. “The hardest part was weighing the risk to my baby with the risk of not treating the cancer right away,” she says. Doctors made the decision to perform a &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/happens-during-lumpectomy-130000529.html" data-ylk="slk:lumpectomy;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;lumpectomy&lt;/a&gt; while Pearson was still pregnant, but chemotherapy would have to wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I think the whole experience [of having cancer] was so tied up with being pregnant because all the decisions were based on that, and I was very focused on what everything would mean for the baby,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Doctors ended up deciding to induce Pearson’s labor early at 35 weeks; she started chemo when her daughter was a week old. The birth of her daughter, though joyous, marked the beginning of a new chapter in her fight against cancer. “I was quite lucky with how I dealt with chemo. Most of the time, I was still able to look after my toddler and newborn during the treatment,” she says, adding that her husband took on much of the nighttime care. “I wasn’t allowed to breastfeed, which had the advantage that anyone could help out by feeding the baby in the night.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Pearson, now 44, drew strength from her support system. “You go into a sort of autopilot, I think. You get on with things and carry on because you have to, especially if you have another child already, as I did,” she says. The emotional strain, however, was hard to ignore. “It’s hard to talk about your fears of dying and leaving your children behind with the people who love you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="i-didnt-want-to-bond-with-the-baby-because-i-didnt-think-i-would-ever-meet-him"&gt;‘I didn’t want to bond with the baby because I didn’t think I would ever meet him’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In 2019, Emily Dilger from New York was 14 weeks pregnant and caring for her 2-year-old when she began struggling to breathe. She was initially diagnosed with pneumonia, but, she tells Yahoo Life, “I never seemed to get better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After multiple visits to the doctor, Dilger was told her symptoms were just part of the pneumonia healing process. But 22 weeks into her pregnancy, she insisted on a chest X-ray, which revealed a mass between her heart and lungs. The following week, she was diagnosed with&lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1" class="link " href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24405-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:large B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:9;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt; large B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Honestly, I didn’t think I was going to survive,” Dilger says. “I was tired and scared. It felt very lonely. I didn’t want to bond with the baby because I didn’t think I would ever meet him or live long enough for him to remember me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Unlike Pearson, Dilger began chemotherapy quickly, which meant she had to stop breastfeeding her toddler; the treatments also took a toll and made it difficult to care for her family. “I was really sick. I would cough so hard I’d throw up every single day,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At 32 weeks, she developed &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1" class="link " href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21637-hellp-syndrome" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HELLP syndrome;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:10;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;HELLP syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, a rare pregnancy complication that can cause sharp abdominal pain, headache and blurred vision, and was transferred by ambulance to Rochester, N.Y., where she delivered her baby prematurely. “He was so tiny,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sharing her experiences on social media helped, however. She also has a new perspective on life these days. Says Dilger: “Walking out of the hospital after I was diagnosed, I looked at flowers differently. I’m so thankful I’m alive to see them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="every-morning-i-felt-like-i-was-waking-up-in-a-bad-dream"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Every morning, I felt like I was waking up in a bad dream’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Katie Wolf’s breast cancer journey began with months of reassurance from doctors that the lump she discovered early in her second pregnancy was nothing to worry about. “I felt the lump while breastfeeding my son, who was about a year and a half [old] at the time,” she tells Yahoo Life. Initially, her ob-gyn believed it was just a cyst or &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1" class="link " href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15690-fibroadenomas-of-the-breast" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fibroadenoma;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:11;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;fibroadenoma&lt;/a&gt;, likely caused by the hormones from breastfeeding and pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But after she moved to her hometown and joined a local midwifery practice, Wolf’s concerns persisted. “I had weaned my son by that point, and it still hadn’t gone away,” she says. The midwifery practice sent her for an ultrasound, and despite the radiologist’s initial lack of concern, a biopsy was recommended to “rule everything out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Soon after, at 24 weeks pregnant, Wolf received the news: She had breast cancer. The tumor was aggressive, hormone-negative and at least stage II, measuring nearly 5 cm. The surgeon who delivered the results made it clear that her pregnancy limited her treatment options. “Every morning, I felt like I was waking up in a bad dream,” she says of that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Wolf underwent six rounds of chemo while pregnant, battling extreme fatigue and anemia and requiring multiple blood transfusions. “I was so focused on trying to survive that I would sometimes forget I was even pregnant ... until I felt a kick,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While her baby thrived, Wolf struggled to gain weight. She switched to a high-risk ob-gyn in Boston, who collaborated with her oncologist. Together, they decided to induce labor at 37 weeks. After a break to regain strength after giving birth, Wolf resumed treatment nine days postpartum, now incorporating a new chemotherapy drug and immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Wolf began to feel physically better after birth, but the struggle was far from over. “It was one foot in front of the other every day,” she says. After a further 10 rounds of chemo, she was declared cancer-free, a milestone she marked just over a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Wolf is grateful to now be raising two small boys as a cancer survivor. “I gained a new appreciation for my body, and my perspective on life will forever be changed,” she says. “I know my story could have gone very differently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="it-was-a-constant-mental-battle-between-preparing-for-labor-and-preparing-for-a-fight-i-wasnt-ready-for"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘It was a constant mental battle between preparing for labor and preparing for a fight I wasn’t ready for’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At her 20-week ultrasound, Inga Cushman’s doctors noticed that the ventricles in her unborn daughter’s brain were larger than expected. This concern led to multiple ultrasounds and a fetal MRI. “That’s when the pediatric neurosurgeon also had the opportunity to tell me they caught a glimpse of a tumor on my kidney,” Cushman tells Yahoo Life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The discovery of the tumor was a complete surprise. “I didn’t have any symptoms,” Cushman says. “It was just a fluke, a note on an MRI that was more focused on my daughter.” Meanwhile, it was determined that her baby had &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hydrocephalus/symptoms-causes/syc-20373604" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hydrocephalus;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:12;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;hydrocephalus&lt;/a&gt;, or a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It was a constant mental battle between preparing for labor and preparing for a fight I wasn’t ready for,” the Wisconsin mom of two says of her family’s dueling health scares. After giving birth via C-section, Cushman underwent a biopsy that confirmed she had &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1" class="link " href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24906-renal-cell-carcinoma" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:renal cell carcinoma;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:13;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;renal cell carcinoma&lt;/a&gt;. “I was in the hospital dealing with the tumor while my husband was in another hospital supporting our newborn through her own hospital stay. At the same time, our older daughter and two dogs were at home, all needing care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Cushman’s recommended treatment was surgery to remove the tumor while preserving her kidney. “Luckily, as odd as it is to say in a cancer story, I didn’t have to have any additional chemo or treatment. It was just the surgery that needed to happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But just a week before Cushman’s scheduled surgery, her newborn, who she named Diana, had complications due to her condition; doctors said she needed surgery to have a shunt placed in her brain to drain the excess fluid. This added a two-week hospital stay for Diana, which overlapped with Cushman’s own surgery, complicating their already stressful situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Cushman had follow-up CT scans for the next few years to monitor for any recurrence of her cancer. Navigating that uncertainty along with Diana’s own health needs has been tough, but Cushman understands all too well that it was her daughter’s diagnosis that led to her own health issue being caught. “There wasn’t any inclination that something was wrong in my body, other than I was growing a child,” she says of her lack of symptoms. She adds: “If [Diana] wouldn’t have had her challenges, I don’t know where we would be right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl" data-jump-link-target="" id="what-expectant-mothers-can-do"&gt;What expectant mothers can do&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“While my goal is to treat cancer, I know, more importantly, our goal should be to &lt;em&gt;prevent &lt;/em&gt;cancer,” says Cohen. He stresses the importance of knowing one’s&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/the-holidays-are-a-good-time-to-discuss-your-family-health-history-heres-what-to-ask-about-and-why-its-important-100039001.html" data-ylk="slk:family history;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt; family history&lt;/a&gt; to see if there’s a high risk for cancer and considering genetic testing for early cancer detection. Genetic tests, such as blood or saliva tests, can identify inherited cancer risks and guide prevention efforts. He also highlights &lt;a data-i13n="elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:15;pos:1" class="link " href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2401029" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:advancements in cell-free DNA testing;elm:context_link;elmt:doNotAffiliate;cpos:15;pos:1;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;advancements in cell-free DNA testing&lt;/a&gt; during pregnancy, which screens both mother and baby for abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Cohen also advises that patients be proactive in their health care and speak up if they experience abnormal symptoms. While distinguishing between pregnancy-related discomfort and more serious health concerns can be challenging, he stresses the importance of addressing any unusual bleeding, unexplained pain or new lumps or bumps with an ob-gyn or primary care doctor. Early action can ensure thorough evaluations and better outcomes. His advice? “Advocate, advocate, advocate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 11:00:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxOQ2RERmc5MkJodzdIampMeGRkSzExbkd5ZlNXNU5uMVA1bGNRRG1LWkFPdnNKa0Zjd3RaODFYNjlGbW54WGxzdTNwZF9wRHRHWlZwTUFtMFBBT1dUQnZMS0NOd2stRzVuU1lfMlU0UlhBM3Izd05uZG41M2kyOVJwaGR1Mk94ZzZOdlBOa3VzaWhOQ21RS1hFVkJkdTEyTlNpM1R1cnRvd1dPWjVrZ25vSHhpcTU1YWRORGdxdDBud2k</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Discover a “Second Heart” That Powers Our Blood Circulation - The Daily Galaxy</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxQOEtPVmhKYzRtTUYwcWNEYndMcGZHTEhLNHJIWHE3eWdpcS1sN1JLTEZOMFRWOVNVamVSRk1HNVZkcFRZdnlBam5zamVYakg3bkNjTTZPajJxazdYSTNTSUtZSzJNZHViRTM3eE9QeWtiYmgxUWU0S3dwR1pwNGpSWmxLY2FPU25yRndNOUU4SjZZVF9oOWlUTkdsbG43czdET0Ew?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;aorta&lt;/strong&gt;, a large &lt;strong&gt;blood vessel&lt;/strong&gt; responsible for transporting &lt;strong&gt;oxygenated blood&lt;/strong&gt; from the heart to the rest of the body, plays a crucial role in our &lt;strong&gt;circulatory system&lt;/strong&gt;. While it has long been known that the aorta has &lt;strong&gt;elastic properties&lt;/strong&gt; that help absorb &lt;strong&gt;pressure variations&lt;/strong&gt;, recent research reveals that the aorta’s role extends beyond this passive function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;New findings suggest that the aorta actively assists the heart by generating a &lt;strong&gt;wave-pumping effect&lt;/strong&gt;, providing crucial support for &lt;strong&gt;blood circulation&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly in individuals with heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Discovering the Aortic Wave-Pumping Effect&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the&lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2024.0887" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Journal of The Royal Society Interface&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, delves into a remarkable discovery that the aorta can function much like a &lt;strong&gt;secondary heart&lt;/strong&gt;, assisting the primary heart in pumping &lt;strong&gt;blood&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon, known as “&lt;strong&gt;wave-pumping&lt;/strong&gt;,” occurs when the aorta stretches and recoils in response to the heart’s contraction and relaxation cycles. Researchers suggest that this process, which was initially observed in the &lt;strong&gt;embryonic stages&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;blood circulation&lt;/strong&gt;, may persist into adulthood, playing a vital role in &lt;strong&gt;blood flow&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the study, researchers used magnetic resonance imaging &lt;strong&gt;(MRI) &lt;/strong&gt;to monitor the movement of the aorta in 159 participants, including those with heart &lt;strong&gt;failure&lt;/strong&gt;. Their results highlighted a significant difference in the &lt;strong&gt;aortic displacement profiles&lt;/strong&gt; between healthy individuals and heart failure patients. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The healthy group exhibited greater aortic stretching, which was less pronounced in those with heart &lt;strong&gt;failure&lt;/strong&gt;. This provides further evidence that the aorta’s stretch and recoil could help enhance circulation when the &lt;strong&gt;heart’s&lt;/strong&gt; pumping capacity is compromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Mechanics of Aortic Stretch and Recoil&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class="gb-container gb-container-c6586980"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aortic wave-pumping, or “i&lt;strong&gt;mpedance pumping&lt;/strong&gt;,” relies on the aorta’s ability to store and release &lt;strong&gt;energy&lt;/strong&gt; during the &lt;strong&gt;cardiac cycle&lt;/strong&gt;. During the heart’s contraction &lt;strong&gt;(systole)&lt;/strong&gt;, the aorta stretches as blood is pushed into it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then, during relaxation &lt;strong&gt;(diastole),&lt;/strong&gt; the aorta recoils, releasing the&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/03/atomic-collisions-unleash-energy-bursts/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="81309" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; stored energy &lt;/a&gt;and helping maintain &lt;strong&gt;blood flow&lt;/strong&gt;. This wave-pumping effect works in tandem with the heart’s pumping mechanism, assisting the overall circulation without the need for additional heartbeats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This discovery is significant as it unveils a previously underappreciated aspect of aortic function. The study suggests that this wave-pumping effect could become an essential mechanism, especially in those suffering from heart failure, where the heart’s ability to pump blood is reduced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aorta’s contribution to circulation could alleviate some of the burden placed on the heart, supporting the flow of &lt;strong&gt;oxygenated blood&lt;/strong&gt; through the body.&lt;/p&gt;

(B) Time profile of the aortic root displacement for three cases: healthy individual of 41 years old, healthy individual of 65 years old and heart failure patient who was 43 years old.

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Implications for Heart Failure Treatment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implications of these findings could be profound for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/12/doctors-say-the-heart-might-be-able-to-heal-itself-but-what-does-that-mean-for-heart-failure/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="74582" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heart failure treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. As the aorta plays a supplementary role in &lt;strong&gt;blood circulation&lt;/strong&gt;, its function could be targeted in therapies aimed at reducing the strain on the heart. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers are exploring potential treatments to enhance the &lt;strong&gt;elasticity&lt;/strong&gt; of the aorta, which could help support circulation in patients with &lt;strong&gt;heart failure&lt;/strong&gt;. Some existing antihypertensive medications already work to modify &lt;strong&gt;arterial stiffness&lt;/strong&gt;, but their effect on the aorta’s wave-pumping mechanism remains an area for further research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The findings from this study could also explain why some individuals with weakened hearts can still maintain adequate blood circulation. The aorta may compensate for the heart’s decreased ability to pump &lt;strong&gt;blood&lt;/strong&gt;, ensuring that the body continues to receive the necessary &lt;strong&gt;oxygen&lt;/strong&gt; and nutrients. U&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;nderstanding the wave-pumping effect of the aorta offers new hope for improving heart &lt;strong&gt;failure management&lt;/strong&gt; and could lead to the development of more effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                        &lt;figure class="image image--expandable"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/04/1743931616_garden_soil_image_souce_depositphotos_via_neowin.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="garden soil picture" src="https://cdn.neowin.com/news/images/uploaded/2025/04/1743931616_garden_soil_image_souce_depositphotos_via_neowin_story.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, researchers discovered a new antibiotic called "lariocidin," which may help fight bacteria that do not respond to regular medicines. This finding is important because drug-resistant bacteria are becoming a serious global health problem. Millions of people die each year because current antibiotics no longer work against certain infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funnily, the antibiotic was found in a technician's garden! Scientists took soil samples from the garden and analyzed them. It was observed that a bacterium called "Paenibacillus" produces lariocidin, a type of lasso peptide. Lasso peptides are special because they have a knotted structure that makes them very stable and hard to break down. This characteristic allows lariocidin to stay active for a longer time compared to many other antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way lariocidin works is different from how most antibiotics attack bacteria. It targets the ribosome, which is the part of a bacterial cell responsible for making proteins. Proteins are essential for bacteria to survive and multiply. Lariocidin disrupts this process in two ways: it stops the ribosome from working properly and forces it to make mistakes when creating proteins. This combined action effectively kills the bacteria, even those that have developed resistance to other antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;

                            
            &lt;p&gt;This discovery highlights the value of soil as a source of new medicines. Microorganisms found in soil have evolved unique ways to defend themselves against other microbes, making them a rich resource for antibiotic development. Scientists are increasingly studying soil bacteria to find solutions to the problem of drug-resistant infections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antimicrobial resistance is a pressing global health issue, with drug-resistant infections causing millions of deaths annually. The World Health Organization (WHO) &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/17-05-2024-who-updates-list-of-drug-resistant-bacteria-most-threatening-to-human-health"&gt;has identified&lt;/a&gt; antibiotic resistance as one of the top ten threats to public health. The development of new antibiotics is crucial to counteract this trend and ensure the effectiveness of medical treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While lariocidin is exciting, it is still in the early stages of research. Scientists will need to conduct more studies to test if it is safe and effective for use in humans. They will also need to figure out how to produce it on a large scale for medical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

This week, I have another lazy person's dinner hack: the ricotta plate. This was inspired by an excellent appetizer I had at a restaurant recently, and it couldn’t be simpler. Just scoop a heap of ricotta onto a plate alongside roasted, seasoned-to-your-liking veggies and chickpeas and dig in. &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:49;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/healthiest-cheese-supermarket-140000990.html" data-ylk="slk:Ricotta boasts calcium and protein;cpos:49;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;Ricotta boasts calcium and protein&lt;/a&gt;, and it can be sweetened with a drizzle of honey (make it hot honey if you’re feeling spicy) or balsamic vinaigrette.

Be it munching on our favourite burger or sitting in a cafe with a cup of hot chocolate or sharing a pizza with our friends, junk food makes up for the greatest of memories. However, junk food is equally unhealthy and can cause health hazards. Especially for people in their weight loss journey, too much of junk food can slow down their progress. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/love-junk-food-but-afraid-of-gaining-weight-lifestyle-coach-shares-5-strategies-to-balance-health-and-cravings-101743671531357.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love junk food but afraid of gaining weight?

Fitness coach &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.instagram.com/raj.ganpath/" target="_blank"&gt;Raj Ganpath&lt;/a&gt;, in an Instagram video on April 4, shared the hacks to consume junk food but also enjoy it in moderation. “We are going to eat junk anyway. So, let's make sure it is worth it and that we're smart about it,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="shortEntryContainer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="mt10 mb10 htEchoArticlePromo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="predictorShow mb20" data-vars-predictor="true" data-vars-quiz="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="quizShow mb20" data-vars-minimized="false" data-vars-predictor="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Make it worth it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Make sure it is amazing. The only reason we eat junk food is to have fun. We really enjoy the taste and the experience. So, make sure any junk food that you're eating really fits the bill. Make sure you truly enjoy it. Make sure it blows your mind. Don't have it simply because someone is offering it to you or because you have nothing else to do,” Raj Ganpath said. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/fitness-trainer-shares-top-10-unhealthiest-foods-on-the-planet-and-how-they-harm-your-body-vegan-cheese-is-terrible-101743820001566.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fitness trainer shares 'top 10 unhealthiest foods on the planet' and how they harm your body: 'Vegan cheese is terrible'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Don't have junk food when you are hungry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Extreme hunger and junk food do not go well together because when you're extremely hungry, you tend to consume large portions of food, and junk food is not meant to be consumed in large portions for many many health reasons. So, if you are very hungry, make sure you don't open your favourite food delivery app. Don't go to a store and stand in front of the chocolate aisle. Don't open a box of cookies and sit in front of the tv. Instead eat something healthy like fruits, vegetable, protein. Bring your hunger levels down to a manageable extent and then consider junk food,” said the fitness coach.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Make it difficult to access&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Make it hard to access. if you order junk food in large quantities and store it at home, it is simply a matter of time before you feel demotivated or before you feel sorry for yourself or before you fight with someone or before you feel like you deserve a treat and you go looking for junk food. So, make it inconvenient. order in small portions and finish it off. If you are not able to finish it off, toss the rest. It is cheap enough. if you need more, you can always order more. It's a little more inconvenient than just having it home, but that's the point,” Raj Ganpath added. &lt;strong&gt;Also read | &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/childhood-obesity-on-rise-6-effective-ways-to-tackle-junk-food-addiction-in-kids-101709693853619.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Childhood obesity on rise: 6 effective ways to tackle junk food addiction in kids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts at one of the world's top institutions have explained how a change to a specific diet can boost the chances of staving off dementia and other degenerative illnesses such as Parkinson's. They said the change was one way to boost what is known as cognitive reserve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This, the experts at Harvard Medical School said, is your brain's ability to improvise and essentially find another way to get something done. They said cognitive reserve was "developed by a lifetime of education and curiosity".&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The experts explained: "The concept of cognitive reserve originated in the late 1980s, when researchers described individuals with no apparent symptoms of dementia who were nonetheless found at autopsy to have brain changes consistent with advanced Alzheimer's disease. These individuals did not show symptoms of the disease while they were alive because they had a large enough cognitive reserve to offset the damage and continue to function as usual.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Since then, research has shown that people with greater cognitive reserve are better able to stave off symptoms of degenerative brain changes associated with dementia or other brain diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, or a stroke. A more robust cognitive reserve can also help you function better for longer if you're exposed to unexpected life events, such as stress, surgery, or toxins in the environment. Such circumstances demand extra effort from your brain—similar to requiring a car to engage another gear."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at Harvard Medical School have identified six cornerstones to any effective brain health and cognitive fitness programme. They said these were:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Step 1: Eat a plant-based diet &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Step 2: Exercise regularly &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Step 3: Get enough sleep &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Step 4: Manage your stress &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Step 5: Nurture social contacts &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Step 6: Continue to challenge your brain &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They concluded: "These factors are equal parts of a cohesive plan—they don't work in isolation. Simply eating more fibre or adding a morning walk to your routine isn't enough to forestall mental decline. Instead, exercise, diet, sleep, stress management, social interaction, and mental stimulation work in concert to yield results."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is more information in Harvard Medical School's report, &lt;a href="https://www.ne16.com/t/8716518/208796966/6213269/0/1000401/?b44ed14b=YTQ1OTYzZmMtYzVkNS00YzJlLTgyNDUtMjI1YmE1MGVhODlj&amp;amp;x=b6b9787f" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;A Guide to Cognitive Fitness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 02:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxPUWtKc2lDZXNCT2hXNTFvSXVGMkhOSDd3X3h2dE4weG1hcjYyeXFNcmFHb1JtWkZ5allUdDVyRGNfSjE3Zkx1OHdCT1ZNZ2dBbXZveFVuUmU1VTZCOXM1UktVYnRUNmwwZENtdHBMMEV3ellNWmFuUm1mSE1jWUdJN2Rabm8zZXpUTkJqYUlB0gGTAUFVX3lxTE1Pdjd6dkczRFF4QVdVTnZQNEJWS09aX2ZUM1kwdVpMZXZ1dWZiYzlqZGJJMjl1ZXhlbk9qTmVWalRpNmtvRExKNzhVblJUUlFMR2dBOXFQeXpES2xFQTdYSnV5WjlTRmdoQlV0MmVDNDExdXNjX2NZSjhxaDkwdDBaXzhUWTdDZkVaQi1kTXBiMUMxQQ</guid></item><item><title>New Israeli comprehensive study examines massive physiological load of childbirth - The Jerusalem Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxQMUd3THJUellxbEF6VGJIZUJvRDlBNmhydThVSHBKU1R2TU5KdlpBX3M4Ylg3Mk1PY1ExWEZlUFA4UWFfZmdvOFJLTkp6S1gxSGdCMzBPOGV3bWxVYUJkTVdLMWdEUUt5VzBzQXJuSkVXQ1ZXcmJsVjZab3RHTEdVN0pn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="article-inner-content" itemprop="articleBody" id="startBannerSticky"&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;If you ask any &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/tags/pregnant"&gt;pregnant woman&lt;/a&gt; if she felt differently before she conceived and after giving birth, she will concur immediately. It’s well known that pregnancy and delivery dramatically affect virtually all systems of the woman’s body, but until now, these changes have, surprisingly, not been systematically analyzed over time in a large human population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers at the &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/health-and-wellness/article-845344"&gt;Weizmann Institute of Science&lt;/a&gt; in Rehovot have accomplished this with 76 lab tests based on a cross-sectional analysis of 44 million measurements from over 300,000 pregnancies that included about half of the pregnancies in Israel between the years 2003 and 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data, obtained using the large database of Clalit Health Services (the country’s largest health fund, covering 55% of the Israeli population), provide a comprehensive dynamic portrait of pregnancy, the first of its kind – a comprehensive picture of physiological changes in the mother’s body during and after pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="divAnyClip hide-for-premium"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="divVidazoo hide-for-premium"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prof. Uri Alon and his team in the institute’s department of molecular cell biology have just published their study in the journal Science Advances under the title “Pregnancy and postpartum dynamics revealed by millions of lab tests.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by Dr. Alon Bar and Ron Moran, in collaboration with Dr. Yoel Toledano from the maternal fetal medicine division at the Helen Schneider Hospital for Women at the Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva, analyzed weekly changes in each of the 76 parameters from 20 weeks before conception to 80 weeks after delivery.&lt;figure class="article-image-in-body"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article-image-caption article-image-credit"&gt;Pregnancy (Illustrative) (credit: PXFUEL)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The multidisciplinary team consists of physicists, biologists, computer scientists, and MDs working together to form the basic equations of hormone circuits, antibiotics, autoimmunity, cancer, mood disorders, and age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alon told &lt;em&gt;The Jerusalem Post&lt;/em&gt; that he knows of no such study conducted abroad, and foreign researchers expressed much interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Birthrates down&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The birthrate is way down in &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/article-848588"&gt;Europe&lt;/a&gt; and places like Japan. Over the course of three years, we examined data on Israeli Jews and Arabs, ultra-Orthodox (haredi) and Bedouin women who give birth to large children. It usually takes a year for women to return to their base condition. Some need more medical supervision than others. I’m not a gynecologist, but there are some countries with very short maternity leaves, and for some, the women return too soon.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extensive results highlight the massive physiological load of &lt;a href="https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-848391"&gt;childbirth&lt;/a&gt;. In about half the tests, the values returned to baseline only three months to a year after the delivery. Alongside healthy pregnancies, the researchers also tracked pregnancy complications such as gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, and postpartum bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The precision of the data revealed effects of preconception supplements, overshoots after delivery, and intricate temporal responses to changes in blood volume and kidney filtration rate. Pregnancy complications – gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia and postpartum hemorrhage – showed distinct dynamical changes.&lt;section class="hide-for-premium"&gt; &lt;section class="script-3632-container-wrap"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div class="script-3632-container"&gt;        &lt;div class="script-3632-text"&gt;            &lt;p class="script-3632-text-first"&gt;Stay updated with the latest news!&lt;/p&gt;            &lt;p class="script-3632-text-second"&gt;Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter&lt;/p&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;            &lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During pregnancy, the mother’s cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, gastrointestinal, skeletal, metabolic, endocrine, and immune systems are all affected by fetal demand and massive endocrine secretion by the placenta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevated demand for oxygen and nutrients causes an increase in cardiac output and up to 50% growth in blood volume; the kidneys increase the glomerular filtration rate by 50%, leading to increased urine production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immune system is modulated to prevent rejection of the fetus, and coagulation and red blood cells show marked changes, while metabolism shifts to increased insulin resistance and lipid production to supply energy for fetal growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delivery marks a profound change, as the fetus and placenta leave the body and abruptly cease their metabolic and endocrine effects. The mother undergoes a series of adaptations in which various physiological systems recover with different timescales – from hours to months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During pregnancy and after delivery post an increased risk of complications including gestational diabetes, postpartum hemorrhage, anemia, depression, and eclampsia (a serious blood pressure condition that develops during pregnancy that leads to high blood pressure and high levels of protein in the urine; it usually develops after the 20th week of pregnancy).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding healthy physiology and pathology is essential for both advancing basic science and as a baseline for treatment. This understanding of the physiological changes during pregnancy and postpartum requires precise temporal data on numerous physiological parameters. However, existing studies have a limited number of participants, consider only a few parameters, and have been tested only about three times during the pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Knowledge is even more sparse in the postpartum period in which a single time point is usually measured,” the team wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The precision of the dataset allows detection of intricate dynamical changes, including the impact of preconception supplements, and the deviations from healthy pregnancy in pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, and postpartum hemorrhage,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study thus provides a resource for understanding pregnancy and the postpartum period and demonstrates how it may be used to understand mechanisms in systems physiology, and it greatly expands our knowledge of the postpartum period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="fake-br-for-article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — Opioid overdose reversal medication naloxone has now saved the lives of over 12,500 Utahns, marking a significant milestone in the state's battle against opioid overdose deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The milestone comes as a result of the combined effort between Utah Naloxone, a nonprofit dedicated to expanding naloxone access, and Intermountain Health's Opioid Education and Naloxone Distribution program. They also work with Utah law enforcement partners, who are often first responders to opioid overdose events. Of the 12,500 lives saved by naloxone, more than 1,000 received naloxone administered by law enforcement officers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intermountain Health's Opioid Education and Naloxone Distribution program not only works to distribute free naloxone kits to community members but aims to provide education and reduce the stigma surrounding opioid overdose, according to Lisa Nichols, vice president of community health at Intermountain Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To be really clear, you don't have to have a substance use disorder to die from an overdose," said Nichols. "People receive opioids all of the time, post-surgery or post-dental care. So we also want people to understand the risk. And that's why the education is important, because someone will get that from their physician and think, 'It was it was prescribed; I'm taking it as prescribed; why would I be at risk?' ... It's just kind of opening up the conversation to make sure that everyone knows that if you're taking an opioid or you if you have opioids in your home that are available, you are at risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental deaths in Utah — surpassing motor vehicle crashes, suffocation and drowning — according to a report from the &lt;a href="https://ome.utah.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023-OME-Fatal-Drug-Overdose-Report-1.16.2023.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Utah Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt;. Of all the substances that lead to fatal overdose, the report cites the synthetic opioid fentanyl as the most frequent cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opioid medications, like oxycodone and morphine, are pain management options that can be prescribed after surgery or major injury. Even when taking these medications as prescribed, there can still be risks for some. This includes &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/51283545" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;opioid-induced respiratory depression&lt;/a&gt;, which occurs when an opioid suppresses a person's drive to breathe, sometimes resulting in death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Naloxone works by replacing opioids' connection to receptors in the body, blocking the drug's effects and reversing overdose in minutes, according to the &lt;a href="https://nida.nih.gov/videos/how-naloxone-saves-lives-in-opioid-overdose" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;National Institute of Drug Abuse.&lt;/a&gt; The medication can be used to reverse opioid overdose due to substance abuse as well as the effects of opioid-induced respiratory depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While opioids can be used with no complications for some, Nichols explains naloxone is an option to increase safety while using the medication, and education about opioids helps patients make better-informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We always want to empower patients and consumers, so we encourage people to get a naloxone kit ... but we also encourage them to manage their own health care," said Nichols. "So if a physician is prescribing opioids, say ... 'Is there an alternative? How does this make me at risk?' Just make sure people are actively engaged in their own health care and keeping their family safe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah was ranked No. 4 in the nation for overdose death rates in 2014 when legislators passed the &lt;a href="https://le.utah.gov/~2014/bills/static/HB0119.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Opiate Overdose Emergency Treatment Act&lt;/a&gt; and expanded naloxone access across the state, according to Jennifer Plumb, medical director of Utah Naloxone. Plumb started Utah Naloxone with her brother in 2015 and has worked with partners like Intermountain Health to provide naloxone kits and education for the last decade. Now, as of 2021, Utah ranks No. 42 for overdose deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm super proud of the state for the culture shift that's been a part of this decade," said Plumb, who is also a state senator. "I think that Intermountain Health should be celebrated for both their continued commitment as well as, you know, they've bought into something. They were early adopters and ... it's easy to be a fair-weather friend, but they stay committed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah Naloxone uses donations from Intermountain Health and other donors to buy naloxone kits that can be provided to the public for free. For more information on where to find free naloxone resources, visit the &lt;a href="https://www.utahnaloxone.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Utah Naloxone website&lt;/a&gt;. Intermountain Health also offers &lt;a href="https://intermountainhealthcare.org/services/virtual-care/naloxone" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;naloxone on demand&lt;/a&gt; through its website for the cost of the medication without service fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the issue has improved over the years, Plumb says there is still more work to do in educating residents and providing resources. Utah Naloxone will host a virtual naloxone training on Tuesday, April 8, where participants can learn how to help someone at risk of opioid overdose and receive a free injectable naloxone kit.

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests that married and widowed individuals bear a significantly higher risk of developing dementia than their unmarried and divorced counterparts. The findings contradict long-held beliefs that marriage produces better health outcomes. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;More than 24,000 people between the ages of 50 and 104 participated in the study, which lasted upwards of 18 years depending on the participant. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;While the study failed to yield definitive reasons why single people have a lower risk of developing dementia, potential reasons include a more robust social life, greater self-reliance, or psychologically richer lives. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-full-story"&gt;Full Story&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prevailing wisdom has long held that married people enjoy better health outcomes throughout life. However, &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70072" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;a new study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia suggests that married individuals are significantly more likely to develop dementia than their unmarried and divorced counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="wp-block-san-media-landscape-mobile"&gt;
	&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Florida State University College of Medicine and the University of Montpellier tracked more than 24,000 participants between the ages of 50 and 104 for up to 18 years. Each participant –– who identified as married, widowed, divorced or never married –– began the study without dementia, though some had mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The participants enrolled in the study from 42 different Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centers nationwide and yielded a combined 122,000 “person-years of data,” &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-04-marriage-linked-higher-dementia-older.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;according to Medical Xpress&lt;/a&gt;. They received annual neuropsychological evaluations and clinical exams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-digging-into-the-data"&gt;Digging into the data&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Key to the team’s findings was that  21.9% of both married and widowed participants developed dementia, Alzheimer’s or Lewy body dementia over the course of the study, while only 12.8% and 12.4% of divorced and never-married participants did, respectively. The researchers also noted that their findings largely held regardless of a person’s age, sex, race, education level, lifestyle choices and other variables tied to physical and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of the participants who became widowed during the study’s period, the researchers found that they were less likely to develop dementia than those who were married throughout.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Likewise, while some participants began the study with mild cognitive impairment, the unmarried group was again less likely to progress into clinical dementia over the course of their participation in the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, unmarried men showed the least risk of developing dementia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-not-so-secret-life-of-single-people"&gt;The not-so-secret life of single people&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the study failed to yield definitive answers as to why unmarried and divorced people are less susceptible to dementia, its authors posit several theories, including that single people maintain more robust social ties with their friends and community, and that they are required to be more self-reliant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Never married individuals are also more likely to socialize with friends and neighbors and are more likely to engage in healthier behaviors than their married counterparts,” &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/living-single/202504/dementia-is-more-common-among-the-married-than-the-unmarried" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the study’s authors write&lt;/a&gt;. “Married individuals tend to have less social integration and are engaged in less frequent and lower-quality interactions in their networks compared to their unmarried counterparts. These positive aspects of well-being and social ties may potentially serve as protective factors against dementia over time.”  &lt;/p&gt;






&lt;p&gt;Similarly, &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/living-single/202504/dementia-is-more-common-among-the-married-than-the-unmarried" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;writing in Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Bella DePaulo, an expert on single people and author of “Single at Heart” notes that unmarried individuals “may have more psychologically rich lives characterized by a variety of interesting and unique experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DePaulo adds, “Leading that kind of life may well keep people cognitively sharp.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April 5, 2025 – Los Angeles&lt;/strong&gt; – The Breakthrough Prize Foundation today announced the winners of the 2025 Breakthrough Prizes, honoring scientists driving remarkable discoveries in gene editing, human diseases, the fundamental particles of the Universe and its underlying mathematical principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Breakthrough Prize – popularly known as the “Oscars® of Science” – was created to celebrate the wonders of our scientific age by founding sponsors &lt;strong&gt;Sergey Brin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Priscilla Chan&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Julia&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Yuri Milner&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Anne Wojcicki&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six Breakthrough Prizes of $3 million each were awarded in Life Sciences, Fundamental Physics, and Mathematics. In addition, the foundation announced eight early-career physicists and mathematicians are sharing six $100,000 New Horizons Prizes. Three women mathematicians recently completing PhDs are each receiving a $50,000 Maryam Mirzakhani New Frontiers Prize. This year’s prize money totals $18.75 million, bringing the amount conferred over the 14 years of the Breakthrough Prize to more than $326 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This year’s Breakthrough Prize laureates have made amazing strides – including treatments for major diseases affecting millions of people worldwide – showing once again the transformative power of curiosity-driven basic science.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;– Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The questions these laureates are asking are among the deepest questions there are – about the workings of life, the nature of the Universe and the abstract landscapes of mathematics. It’s inspiring to see scientists seeking and finding answers to these questions.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;– Yuri Milner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The breakthroughs being recognized this year are extraordinary – including, in my own field, amazing gene-editing technologies that are already having a big impact. I’m excited to learn more about the scientists’ ideas across all the fields.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;– Anne Wojcicki&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Life Sciences&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel J. Drucker&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Joel Habener&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Jens Juul Holst&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lotte Bjerre Knudsen&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Svetlana Mojsov&lt;/strong&gt; share the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences. These five scientists' complementary contributions – from basic hormone discovery through physiological understanding to pharmaceutical development – have led to highly effective drugs for diabetes and obesity, ushering in a new era of &lt;strong&gt;GLP-1&lt;/strong&gt; medicines for cardiometabolic disorders. Between them their breakthroughs include: the discovery of the gene encoding the GLP-1 hormone; the synthesis, isolation and characterization of the hormone’s biologically active forms; the demonstration that it is produced in the gut and stimulates insulin production; elucidation of its broader physiological roles, including control of appetite and energy homeostasis; the development of a more stable version of the hormone that continues to act in the body for days rather than hours; and its translation into a new class of drugs that is transforming the treatment of metabolic diseases affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephen L. Hauser&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Alberto Ascherio&lt;/strong&gt; share the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences. The two researchers have transformed the understanding and treatment of &lt;strong&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/strong&gt; (MS), a debilitating neurodegenerative disease in which the immune system attacks the insulating protein around nerve fibers. Among other contributions, Hauser overturned the scientific consensus on the mechanism of MS, identifying the immune system’s B cells as the primary driver of damage to nerve cells. He was also instrumental in the development and testing of B cell-depleting therapies, which have revolutionized modern treatment of the disease. Meanwhile, through painstaking long-term epidemiological analysis, Ascherio discovered the necessary condition for getting MS: infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The majority of the population carries this pathogen, normally without severe effects, but Ascherio showed that contracting it raises the risk of developing MS by a factor of 32. This work opens the possibility of treating MS with antiviral drugs, and for the development of a vaccine for EBV that could effectively prevent MS altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David R. Liu&lt;/strong&gt; is awarded the Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences for developing two powerful, widely used &lt;strong&gt;gene-editing&lt;/strong&gt; technologies. These technologies are engineered molecular machines that correct mutations in our DNA that cause genetic diseases in patients. Importantly, they do not require cutting the DNA double-helix, and thus lead to fewer unwanted outcomes. In 2016 Liu’s lab developed base editing, which corrects the single-letter “misspellings” that constitute about 30 percent of mutations known to cause genetic diseases. Then in 2019 his lab invented prime editing, which replaces whole stretches of defective DNA with a corrected version, and in principle could be used to repair nearly all disease-causing mutations. These technologies have already been distributed more than 20,000 times to labs around the world, resulting in thousands of published advances in research, agriculture, and biomedicine. In animals, base editing and prime editing have successfully corrected mutations to rescue blood diseases such as sickle-cell disease and beta-thalassemia, neurological disorders such as ALS and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), muscle diseases such as muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathies, genetic forms of blindness, genetic forms of hearing loss, several metabolic disorders, and progeria, a premature aging disease. At least 15 base editing and prime editing clinical trials have begun in five countries, with beneficial and, in some cases, life-saving results already confirmed in patients for the treatment of T-cell leukemia, sickle-cell disease, beta-thalassemia, and high cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Fundamental Physics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics is awarded to thousands of researchers from more than 70 countries representing four experimental collaborations at &lt;strong&gt;CERN&lt;/strong&gt;’s &lt;strong&gt;Large Hadron Collider&lt;/strong&gt; (LHC) – &lt;strong&gt;ATLAS&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;CMS&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;ALICE&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;LHCb&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $3 million prize is allocated to ATLAS ($1 million); CMS ($1 million), ALICE ($500,000) and LHCb ($500,000), in recognition of &lt;strong&gt;13,508&lt;/strong&gt; co-authors of publications based on LHC Run-2 data released between 2015 and July 15, 2024. [ATLAS – 5,345 researchers; CMS – 4,550; ALICE – 1,869; LHCb – 1,744].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In consultation with the leaders of the experiments, the Breakthrough Prize Foundation will donate 100 percent of the prize funds to the &lt;strong&gt;CERN &amp;amp; Society Foundation&lt;/strong&gt;. The prize money will be used by the collaborations to offer grants for doctoral students from member institutes to spend research time at CERN, giving the students experience working at the forefront of science and new expertise to bring back to their home countries and regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four experiments are recognized for testing the modern theory of particle physics – the Standard Model – and other theories describing physics that might lie beyond it to high precision. This includes precisely measuring properties of the Higgs boson and elucidating the mechanism by which the Higgs field gives mass to elementary particles; probing extremely rare particle interactions, and exotic states of matter that existed in the first moments of the Universe; discovering more than 72 new hadrons and measuring subtle differences between matter and antimatter particles; and setting strong bounds on possibilities for new physics beyond the Standard Model, including dark matter, supersymmetry and hidden extra dimensions. ATLAS and CMS are general-purpose experiments, which pursue the full program of exploration offered by the LHC’s high-energy and high-intensity proton and ion beams. They synchronously announced the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 and continue to investigate its properties. ALICE studies the quark-gluon plasma, a state of extremely hot and dense matter that existed in the first microseconds after the Big Bang. And LHCb explores minute differences between matter and antimatter, violation of fundamental symmetries, and the complex spectra of composite particles (“hadrons”) made of heavy and light quarks. By performing these extraordinarily precise and delicate tests, the LHC experiments have pushed the boundaries of fundamental physics to unprecedented limits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Mathematics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dennis Gaitsgory&lt;/strong&gt; wins the Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics for his central role in the proof of the geometric Langlands conjecture. The &lt;strong&gt;Langlands program&lt;/strong&gt; is a broad research program spanning several fields of mathematics. It grew out of a series of conjectures proposing precise connections between seemingly disparate mathematical concepts. Such connections are powerful tools; for example, the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem reduces to a particular instance of the Langlands conjecture. These Langlands program equivalences can be thought of as generalizations of the Fourier transform, a tool that relates waves to frequency spectrums and has widespread uses from seismology to sound engineering. In the case of the geometric Langlands conjecture, the proposed one-to-one correspondence is between two very different sets of objects, analogous to these spectrums and waves: on the spectrum side are abstract algebraic objects called representations of the fundamental group, which capture information about the kinds of loop that can wrap around certain complex surfaces; on the “wave” side are sheaves, which, loosely speaking, are rules assigning vector spaces to points on a surface. Gaitsgory has dedicated much of the last 30 years to the geometric Langlands conjecture. In 2013 he wrote an outline of the steps required for a proof, and after more than a decade of intensive research in 2024 he and his colleagues published the full proof, comprising over 800 pages spread over 5 papers. This is a monumental advance, expected to have deep implications in other areas of mathematics too, including number theory, algebraic geometry and mathematical physics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gerard 't Hooft&lt;/strong&gt;, winner of the Special Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics, is one of the world’s most pre-eminent theoretical physicists. In the early 1970s he made crucial contributions to the foundations of what would later become known as the Standard Model of the subatomic particles. He proved that Yang-Mills theories (the mathematical framework underlying theories of both the weak and strong nuclear forces) make sense when treated quantum mechanically – that they can give finite, calculable results rather than meaningless infinities – thus validating theories which became central to the Standard Model. He made several crucial contributions to understanding the theory of the strong force, including resolving a major problem involving the masses of particles through special field configurations called instantons; he developed new mathematical tools for studying strongly interacting quarks; and he introduced the fruitful approach of studying the strong force by imagining it is mediated by many more varieties of quarks and gluons than it actually is. These and other contributions helped establish the Standard Model as a workable theory and provided powerful tools for calculating its predictions. 't Hooft has studied the quantum effects that can explain how information is processed in black holes, which led to the development of the holographic principle in cosmology, and possibly to new alternative ways to interpret quantum mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;New Horizons in Physics Prize&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s New Horizons in Physics Prizes honor early-career researchers across a wide range of fields. In atomic physics, &lt;strong&gt;Waseem Bakr&lt;/strong&gt; has created quantum gas microscopes that can image individual atoms confined in an optical lattice, advancing the study of strongly interacting quantum systems. In quantum information, a field at the fertile intersection of physics, mathematics and computer science, &lt;strong&gt;Jeongwan Haah&lt;/strong&gt; has developed models of emergent quantum systems –macroscopic systems exhibiting quantum behavior, whose potential applications include quantum computing; these models include ‘Haah's code’, which has opened the field of a class of quasi-particles called fractons. And in astronomy, &lt;strong&gt;Sebastiaan Haffert&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Rebecca Jensen-Clem&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Maaike van Kooten&lt;/strong&gt; have designed and enabled novel techniques for extreme adaptive optics, which are systems that compensate for the effects of Earth’s atmosphere on light reaching terrestrial telescopes. Their work promises to enable the direct detection of the smallest exoplanets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;New Horizons in Mathematics Prize&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern physics and higher mathematics share intimate connections, and it is notable that the research areas of all three of this year’s New Horizons in Mathematics Prize winners have links to quantum physics. &lt;strong&gt;Ewain Gwynne&lt;/strong&gt; is recognized for his work in conformal probability, which studies probabilistic objects such as random curves and surfaces. &lt;strong&gt;John Pardon&lt;/strong&gt; has produced a number of important results in geometry and topology, particularly in the field of symplectic geometry and pseudo-holomorphic curves, which are certain types of smooth surfaces in manifolds. &lt;strong&gt;Sam Raskin&lt;/strong&gt; has played a significant role in the major recent progress on the geometric Langlands program (see Mathematics section above), including the final proof of the geometric Langlands conjecture in characteristic 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Maryam Mirzakhani New Frontiers Prize&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Maryam Mirzakhani New Frontiers Prize is awarded to outstanding women mathematicians who have recently completed their PhDs. &lt;strong&gt;Si Ying Lee&lt;/strong&gt; has found a new approach to an important problem in the Langlands program (see Mathematics section above), succeeding in reducing it to a local problem. &lt;strong&gt;Rajula Srivastava&lt;/strong&gt; has made progress in a challenging area at the intersection of harmonic analysis and number theory. Her work focuses on bounding the number of lattice points one can find near a given smooth surface, with important applications to Diophantine approximation in higher dimensions. &lt;strong&gt;Ewin Tang&lt;/strong&gt; has invented quantum computing algorithms for machine learning. She also proved that certain calculations, which quantum algorithms were widely considered to be exponentially faster at solving, can actually be solved in comparable time by a normal (non-quantum) computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;About The Breakthrough Prize&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; year, the Breakthrough Prize, renowned as the “Oscars® of Science,” recognizes the world’s top scientists. Each prize is $3 million and presented in the fields of Life Sciences, Fundamental Physics and Mathematics. In addition, up to three New Horizons in Physics Prizes, up to three New Horizons in Mathematics Prizes and up to three Maryam Mirzakhani New Frontiers Prizes are given out to early-career researchers each year. Laureates attend a gala award ceremony designed to celebrate their achievements and inspire the next generation of scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Breakthrough Prizes were founded by Sergey Brin, Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg, Julia and Yuri Milner, and Anne Wojcicki and have been sponsored by foundations established by them. Selection Committees composed of previous Breakthrough Prize laureates in each field choose the winners. Information on the Breakthrough Prize is available at &lt;a href="https://breakthroughprize.org"&gt;breakthroughprize.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;One of the prizes, awarded to Liu, who conducts his research at The Broad Institute in Cambridge, recognizes his lab’s discovery of base and prime gene editing to fight genetic diseases. The technology corrects DNA mutations without the need for cutting DNA’s double-helix structure like previous technologies have. Base editing, developed by Liu’s lab in 2016, corrects single-letter “misspellings” in DNA, and his lab’s 2019 invention of prime editing replaces full stretches of faulty DNA with corrected versions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Liu’s technology has been distributed to more than 20,000 non-profit labs worldwide that are working on treatments for a wide range of genetic diseases, many of which are rare diseases that often do not get attention from large pharmaceuticals. The technology makes it “economically feasible to create therapeutics for small markets,” according to a news release.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Fifteen clinical trials of the technology are ongoing in five different countries, and life-saving results have been seen in patients with T-cell leukemia, sickle-cell disease, beta-thalassemia, and high cholesterol have already been seen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It was really a huge team effort,” said Liu. “It’s a wonderful testament to the the hard work of many of the the people who I’ve had the honor of working with over the past 26 years.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Liu intends to donate his prize winnings to fund research in other labs that might be struggling from &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/03/06/metro/trump-kills-science-funding-dei/" target="_blank"&gt;federal funding cuts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Habener along with four fellow researchers will share in another of the prizes for the discovery of GLP-1 medications in treating diabetes and obesity. The drugs mimic the GLP-1 hormone in the body, which regulates blood sugar and appetite.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I never thought my dream would come true to discover something that impacts millions, even billions, of lives,” said Habener, who researched at Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The award is being shared by Daniel J. Drucker, Jens Juul Holst, Lotte Bjerre Knudsen, and Svetlana Mojsov. Drucker, who is now at the University of Toronto, and Mojsov, at Rockefeller University, both contributed to the discovery while they were at Harvard and MGH.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The team’s invention, which &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/09/27/weight-loss-obesity-glp1-svetlana-mojsov/" target="_blank"&gt;spanned over decades of research&lt;/a&gt;, established a &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/01/21/business/weight-loss-drugs-wegovy-zepbound-obesity-insurance/" target="_blank"&gt;robust market&lt;/a&gt; for the medications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;A third prize will go to Harvard researcher Ascherio and the University of California’s Stephen L. Hauser, for their work finding the virus connected to risk for multiple sclerosis. Those findings may lead to the possibility to treat the disease earlier with antiviral drugs, making it more manageable, or the development of a vaccine to stop the disease at its root.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Ascherio is now looking to how the discovery could be built upon to start fighting other diseases before they take hold.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We are desperately trying to get funding, to expand our research to apply the same blueprint of study design to investigate the role of infection in other diseases, which is a major question that is unanswered at this point,” said Ascherio.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Ascherio found all people who develop multiple sclerosis must have had Epstein Barr Virus previously, which is one of the most common human viruses and the cause of infectious mononucleosis, also known as “mono.” Many people contract the disease, especially in childhood, without ever knowing they had&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;it, and contracting the disease multiplies the risk for developing MS by 32 times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

One of the three life-science prizes recognizes work in the field of neurodegenerative disorders, and this year, that prize highlighted paradigm-shifting research about &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34785-multiple-sclerosis-inhibits-central-nervous-system.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34785-multiple-sclerosis-inhibits-central-nervous-system.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (MS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In MS, the immune system attacks fatty tissue that surrounds nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. Called myelin, this fatty substance helps neurons send signals efficiently. The destruction of myelin undermines neurons' ability to communicate with one another while also triggering &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/52344-inflammation.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/52344-inflammation.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;inflammation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and scarring in the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-sHHr5iJReWy5hs6MjBQsDA" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-sHHr5iJReWy5hs6MjBQsDA slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This leads to symptoms of numbness, weakness, pain, dizziness, slurred speech, coordination problems, and blurred or double vision. Depending on the subtype of MS, a person's symptoms may come and go or steadily worsen over time; some people's disease switches from the former relapsing-remitting pattern to the latter, progressive form of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hauser, who directs UCSF's Weill Institute for Neurosciences, helped identify which immune cells actually drive MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was once thought that &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK535433/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK535433/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;T cells&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; alone were responsible for the disease. These cells normally rid the body of foreign invaders by killing infected cells, sparking inflammation and summoning other immune defenses to sites of infection. But in MS, it was thought that T cells unleashed inflammation against myelin, damaging the tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roche.com/stories/identifying-the-potential-of-b-cell-treatment-in-multiple-sclerosis" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.roche.com/stories/identifying-the-potential-of-b-cell-treatment-in-multiple-sclerosis" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Research findings in the 1970s that supported this idea&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; set the stage for MS therapies that took aim at T cells alone. However, this theory of the disease was incomplete. T cells sparked inflammation, but in animal experiments, T cells alone couldn't trigger the type of myelin damage seen in the brains of people with MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hauser's research filled in the missing piece of the puzzle: Another type of immune cell, called a B cell, is also key in MS. Although he and his colleagues faced resistance to their theory, they eventually got clearance to test a B-cell-targeting drug in MS patients, and it worked. That pivotal study paved the way for B-cell-depleting therapies for MS, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK547750/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK547750/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;such as ocrelizumab&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which are now a mainstay of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the very start of his research, "it would have been impossible to imagine that 35 years later B cells would rest, arguably, at the epicenter of MS immunology," Hauser &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4580247/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4580247/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;wrote in a 2015 essay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/obesity/3-million-breakthrough-prize-awarded-to-developers-of-ozempic-style-drugs" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/obesity/3-million-breakthrough-prize-awarded-to-developers-of-ozempic-style-drugs"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$3 million Breakthrough Prize awarded to developers of Ozempic-style drugs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="linking-a-very-common-infection-to-ms-3"&gt;Linking a very common infection to MS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hauser will share his Breakthrough Prize with Ascherio, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard University. Ascherio is being recognized for "revealing that Epstein-Barr virus infection is the leading risk for multiple sclerosis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes the common disease infectious mononucleosis, better known as "mono"; over &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/13974-mononucleosis" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/13974-mononucleosis" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;95% of people catch the EBV virus&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by adulthood, although not all get the symptoms associated with mono, such as fatigue, fever or swollen lymph nodes. Through a painstaking 20-year study, Ascherio and his colleagues demonstrated that, following an EBV infection, an &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/epstein-barr-virus-multiple-sclerosis-link" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/epstein-barr-virus-multiple-sclerosis-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;individual's risk of MS increases 32-fold&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No other risk factors or viral infections are tied to such a stark increase in the risk for the disease. And absolutely no MS cases were seen among people in the study who hadn't caught EBV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that the virus is so common makes it difficult to prove," Ascherio said. Difficult, but not impossible — Ascherio mentioned polio as a similar example. The annual rate of symptomatic polio infections in the U.S. peaked in 1952, reaching &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/71813/cdc_71813_DS1.pdf?" target="_blank" data-url="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/71813/cdc_71813_DS1.pdf?" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;nearly 58,000 reported cases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and of those, over &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/pinkbook/hcp/table-of-contents/chapter-18-poliomyelitis.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.cdc.gov/pinkbook/hcp/table-of-contents/chapter-18-poliomyelitis.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;21,000 caused paralysis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But many cases of polio go unnoticed; approximately 70% cause no symptoms, while less than 1% of infections lead to paralyzing disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So it's quite common for a virus to be nearly ubiquitous — infect everyone — but cause severe disease, in particular neurological diseases, in only a small minority," Ascherio told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the publication of Ascherio's 20-year study, "there's been a huge shift" in the field, he said. "Now, EBV has been accepted as a central player and the leading cause of MS."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it's not yet known how EBV infection ultimately leads to MS. It's important to note that EBV is a herpesvirus, which means it can lurk in the body, go dormant and reactivate later on. For his part, Ascherio thinks EBV reactivation in the brain is likely important for the development of MS. Figuring out how that mechanism works could help explain why, out of the many people who catch EBV, only a small percentage end up with MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even if that mechanism is unclear, knowing EBV is a key driver of MS points to possible solutions, Ascherio said. For instance, various groups are working on vaccines to prevent EBV infection, with the hope of snuffing out MS down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in theory, you could come up with something like &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/alzheimers-dementia/shingles-vaccine-may-protect-against-dementia" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/alzheimers-dementia/shingles-vaccine-may-protect-against-dementia"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the shingles vaccine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which works by preventing reactivation of the virus that causes chickenpox; perhaps a similar shot could prevent EBV reactivation in the body, Ascherio suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-sHHr5iJReWy5hs6MjBQsDA-iryN5aXdF3RJCUBZmg34dlapLJ5rDRev" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-sHHr5iJReWy5hs6MjBQsDA-iryN5aXdF3RJCUBZmg34dlapLJ5rDRev slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
