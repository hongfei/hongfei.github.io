They can actually cause &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/longevity-doctors-dangers-of-taking-multiple-supplements-less-is-more-2024-11?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:serious health problems;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;serious health problems&lt;/a&gt; if taken incorrectly. Up to 20% of liver toxicity cases in the US are related to supplements, research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it's also a mistake to rule out the potential health benefits of supplements, including those from traditions like Chinese medicine or Ayurveda, according to Dr. Gareth Morris-Stiff, a former surgeon at Cleveland Clinic and chief medical officer at &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://theliverclinic.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Liver Clinic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;The Liver Clinic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of them extremely useful, very beneficial to human health," Morris-Stiff told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the risks from supplements come from taking too much, or too many compounds at once, including medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a matter of getting the right compound for you as an individual for your needs," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to combine supplements without damaging your liver&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important rule for your supplement routine is to choose the right supplements for your goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, you can work out the balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you want to reduce inflammation, milk thistle can help. But it doesn't mix well with other herbs or drugs like antivirals or sleep medications. Combined, it can become too much for the liver to process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris-Stiff said one patient he worked with had a cirrhotic liver and jaundice, with yellow skin and eyes, after taking medications with supplements and home-grown garden herbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Individually they were good, but everything coming together, it ended with toxicity. There's too much competition for the detoxification system in the liver," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check an online research database, such as from the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/herb_All.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Library of Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;National Library of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, for safety information and any known drug interactions before starting a supplement. And always consult your doctor if you're not sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's what Morris-Stiff takes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Curcumin or turmeric for inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris-Stiff said daily curcumin has been part of his routine for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curcumin is a bright yellow compound found in the spice &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/turmeric-benefits?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:turmeric;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;turmeric&lt;/a&gt;, and research has found it has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits. A &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11009219/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2024 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;2024 study&lt;/a&gt; found curcumin may help slow aging and help protect cells from damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His daily dose of turmeric comes from a supplement blend called De-Liver-Ance developed by The Liver Clinic, which also includes peppermint, star anise, red sage, and the nutrient choline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Vitamin D is crucial for the immune system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris-Stiff said he takes a daily multivitamin which contains 5,000 units of vitamin D, well over the typical 600-800 units typically recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that vitamin D has a history of being used in large doses to help the body fight off &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/vitamin-d3-benefits?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:illness and infection;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;illness and infection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that's more in line with what we need," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As many as 40% of Americans are deficient in the nutrient. Talk to your doctor to get your own levels tested and see whether supplementing might help, and how much to take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Selenium reduces risk of chronic disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mineral found in nuts, seafood, beans, and organ meats, selenium is a antioxidant that can help reduce the risk of heart disease and somes cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris-Stiff takes 200 micrograms per day, about four times as much usually recommended by the FDA which he said "woefully inadequate" as the amount of the nutrient in our food has &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1611576114" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:declined over time;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;declined over time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Zinc supports healthy aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same multivitamin Morris-Stiff takes daily also includes 50 milligrams of zinc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/zinc-benefits?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Zinc;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Zinc&lt;/a&gt; is another trace mineral with an important role in protecting metabolism and healthy cell development over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Magnesium is key for brain and muscle health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rounding out his daily mineral supplements, Morris-Stiff said he takes &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/magnesium-benefits?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:500 milligrams of magnesium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;500 milligrams of magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, twice per day, to improve sleep and to help manage a heart condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I use it for rest and sleep predominantly, it helps calm my heart," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/magnesium-for-sleep?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Magnesium;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Magnesium&lt;/a&gt; has surged in popularity in recent years as a tool for more restful sleep, as it helps regular the nerves, muscles, and brain, potentially easing anxiety and restlessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Fatty acids fight inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris-Stiff routinely supplements essential fatty acids like &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/omega-3-benefits?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:omega-3s;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;omega-3s&lt;/a&gt;, which have been linked to healthy aging, lower information, and reduced accumulation of fat in the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recently switched to taking a similar &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/fatty-acid-butter-dairy-may-be-healthy-new-research-suggests-2022-3?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fatty acid called C15:0;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;fatty acid called C15:0&lt;/a&gt;, which emerging evidence suggests may reduce the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and liver problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a surgeon scientist, I like to look at the evidence," he said. "I'm learning and I'm adapting and changing as I come across better supplements."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Probiotics like kombucha boost gut health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/doctor-shares-foods-prescribed-to-fight-disease-2024-5?utm_campaign=insider-sf&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=linkedin&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Certain foods help prevent illness;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Certain foods help prevent illness&lt;/a&gt;, too, particularly fermented foods that offer a dose of probiotics, bacteria that support a healthy gut and metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris-Stiff said he drinks both &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/what-is-kefir?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:kefir;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;kefir&lt;/a&gt; (similar to yogurt) and kombucha daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-gut-health-microbiome-trend-2025-3?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_source=yahoo.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:gut microbiome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, beneficial bacteria in the digestive system, can influence the health of the whole body, including the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This holistic approach is crucial for taking a proactive approach to long-term health overall, helping save you time (and money), according to Morris-Stiff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You could probably prevent four or five consecutive appointments by dealing with the body as a whole as opposed to fixing individual complaints," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-pick-right-supplements-doctors-7-step-daily-routine-2025-6" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Business Insider;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Business Insider&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 14:40:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTFB1dGVuUFE5ZXNxZGZvY0tvMXNYV3NVRk5wODZZSWpna3llaWZWWlZzSFYtZXNLNGpvX3gySWFFYldrSWlFSXo2d2d4ejJfbnZsUmdzb0dUYmM2QWh3NnVtNzRvT1NtQWU5MGQ2Y2M1Um5CMGJaUlg4</guid></item><item><title>肌酸在生命的每个阶段支持大脑和肌肉健康- Earth.com | Creatine supports brain and muscle health during every stage of life - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOWWFTdk5tTi0wQm41U2xoNHJDTG5TTGFuQWQtNERraUhhd2ROcDU3eXRfYjNFSktYTnNIcWxXM082M0Y0U0N6YUdmVTYzbHc3VUEtbmNKZk82SFhpUUs0UjVoZjBJakdYZGEwakZOWmJzOVRtYjJZRlNJelpqRTZsZWM0dlBmM0hxa2RwaU1ZMjJYTi1yc29melk5LWg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world where health advice often changes by the season, it can be hard to keep up. Whether you’re into sports or simply hoping to stay active for the long haul, learning about a supplement called creatine can feel like a breath of fresh air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking plenty of water and making smart dietary choices might help, but many people still worry they’re missing something crucial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-creatine-the-basics"&gt;Understanding creatine – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatine is a natural substance your body uses for energy. It helps your muscles, brain, and other parts of your &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fitness-is-far-more-important-than-weight-for-living-a-healthy-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;body work better&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your body makes some creatine on its own, and you also get some from eating meat and fish. But not everyone gets enough – especially people who don’t eat much meat or fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t get enough creatine, it can affect your health. Kids and teens who don’t get enough may be shorter, weigh less, or have more body fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults may have a higher chance of getting sick or having problems with memory and thinking. Some women might have more issues with pregnancy or their &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/air-pollution-can-reshape-a-babys-brain-before-birth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reproductive health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older people with low creatine might have more trouble with heart health, thinking clearly, or staying strong. This new study digs much deeper into the health benefits of creatine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-creatine-is-good-for-health"&gt;Why creatine is good for health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Richard Kreider from &lt;a href="https://www.tamu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Texas A&amp;amp;M University&lt;/a&gt; is studying creatine as a natural compound, where it is found in meat and fish, that plays a key role in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fitness-tracking-apple-watch-is-helpful-but-not-always-right/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt; production. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It converts into &lt;a href="https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Phosphocreatine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;phosphocreatine&lt;/a&gt;, which powers your cells when you’re pushing yourself in demanding workouts or dealing with daily stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not only about lifting heavier or running faster. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8228369/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows that being low in creatine can correlate with less lean mass, heightened body fat, and reduced athletic performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have studied creatine for several decades, looking into its safety and effects on adults, children, and even older populations. One large &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15502783.2025.2488937" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; reported that plenty of individuals fail to get enough from diet alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-much-creatine-do-you-really-need"&gt;How much creatine do you really need?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You only get about a gram of creatine per pound of red meat or fish, like salmon, so it’s expensive and takes a lot of calories to get a gram,” said Dr. Kreider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/small-bursts-of-intense-exercise-can-slow-brain-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bodies&lt;/a&gt; typically produce about one gram of creatine per day, which falls short of what most of us need. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5545206/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; suggest starting with five grams of creatine four times daily for about a week, and then reducing to 5 to 10 grams a day. This approach boosts creatine without relying solely on large quantities of meat or fish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your exact dose can depend on muscle mass, level of activity, and dietary habits. Whether someone is an athlete in heavy training or a retiree looking to stay active, practical guidance from a medical professional is often the best route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-is-creatine-safe-nbsp"&gt;Is creatine safe? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s absolutely no data supporting any negative side effect anecdotally reported about creatine on the internet and in the media,” said Dr. Kreider. Though you might have heard stories about bloating or cramps, these claims are unsubstantiated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent comprehensive study, involved more than 600 trials, and saw no major uptick in side effects among creatine users compared to those taking placebos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claims that creatine harms the kidneys or leads to long-term problems have not been supported by real-world research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, as with anything else you put in your body, quality matters. Choosing products from reputable sources and verifying labels can help you steer clear of questionable ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-clear-health-benefits-for-different-ages"&gt;Clear health benefits for different ages&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As people grow older, maintaining &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-ai-artificial-intelligence-changing-health-diet-fitness-exercise-approach/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;muscle&lt;/a&gt; mass and healthy cognition can get tricky. Researchers have observed that creatine, when taken consistently, may support muscle health and daily function in older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adolescents might also stand to gain. When diets fall short in providing the recommended two to four grams of creatine a day, kids could experience slower growth and higher body fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working out isn’t the only time you rely on strong muscles. Everyday tasks like standing up from a chair, carrying groceries, and climbing stairs depend on maintaining muscle strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those on plant-based diets, supplementing can make sense. If you’re vegetarian or vegan, you skip the top food sources of creatine (meat and fish), so a supplemental form can fill that gap more easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-human-health-and-creatine-supplements"&gt;Human health and creatine supplements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some nutrition &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/books/reprint/5131-creatine-supplementation-for-health-and-clinical-diseases"&gt;experts&lt;/a&gt; have probed links between creatine levels and mood, immunity, and even heart health. While the evidence is still growing, they see promise in using it alongside a balanced lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost factor also comes into play. Buying high-quality red meat or fish every day can strain your wallet, while creatine supplements can be a cost-friendly way to meet your target intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though you can measure out a few grams of powder daily, it’s smart to pair creatine with a nutrient-rich diet. Complex carbohydrates, proteins, and healthy fats all work in tandem with creatine to energize your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydration is also crucial. Water helps your system manage nutrients, including creatine, and keeps you from running on empty. If you have any underlying health concerns, it’s wise to check in with a trusted professional to fine-tune your plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15502783.2025.2488937" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 14:22:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOWWFTdk5tTi0wQm41U2xoNHJDTG5TTGFuQWQtNERraUhhd2ROcDU3eXRfYjNFSktYTnNIcWxXM082M0Y0U0N6YUdmVTYzbHc3VUEtbmNKZk82SFhpUUs0UjVoZjBJakdYZGEwakZOWmJzOVRtYjJZRlNJelpqRTZsZWM0dlBmM0hxa2RwaU1ZMjJYTi1yc29melk5LWg</guid></item><item><title>意见：延长寿命的秘诀可能是这种老式的英式早餐- MarketWatch | Opinion: The secret to a longer life could be this old-fashioned English breakfast - MarketWatch</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxQekxReE9PdlQyZGZ4SFFOcHI1R3ZwTnlXNUxDNGdkT1Qwdmc0SVBFSjBEUkVZMVA4SzJYeHJnandDLTBmWmlVcUNWeUhmcV9RZjB5VzVGT0VESnlJcmItVGx6WHlyMm1WcUdwT1Azei1Ba2RTN3B2WXpkaVdIbENoUlhld3FaUGRDV3Zlc2ktMl9VUmRVWUxpYmlxTk53NUEwcHdVZDF3VTFUUUp1NDlNR2V3UWRqRTA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MarketWatch</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxQekxReE9PdlQyZGZ4SFFOcHI1R3ZwTnlXNUxDNGdkT1Qwdmc0SVBFSjBEUkVZMVA4SzJYeHJnandDLTBmWmlVcUNWeUhmcV9RZjB5VzVGT0VESnlJcmItVGx6WHlyMm1WcUdwT1Azei1Ba2RTN3B2WXpkaVdIbENoUlhld3FaUGRDV3Zlc2ktMl9VUmRVWUxpYmlxTk53NUEwcHdVZDF3VTFUUUp1NDlNR2V3UWRqRTA</guid></item><item><title>医生对名人用作“大脑燃料”的病毒性“无限药丸”发出重大警告- LADbible | Doctors issue major warning over viral 'limitless pill' that is being used by celebrities as 'brain fuel' - LADbible</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxQM2pQRDQtalBfTE5taFAxNW9wczQ0UmktbXNhVzg0RXo5bUNvaVg2czdlMG04YW9NQ0Fnc1NVOG5RdnR0NEZTekRqdXZRNXNpcUtzc2FuR2xOZVMzMjdiSW1wX181Z0luODJLU09LUElpbG1WUnNvS1lTUHNfUmFWRmEyVkxXMy1iRG5neThadkdGUktVOWR0VmZoTXdqbWNoRmZsQw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Doctors have issued a major warning over the viral ‘limitless pill’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Said to be used by various &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/celebrity"&gt;celebrities&lt;/a&gt;, influencers and &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/politics"&gt;political&lt;/a&gt; figures, it’s likened to being a ‘brain fuel’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;No, not a &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/what-happens-eat-chia-seeds-simulation-271006-20250612"&gt;common superfood&lt;/a&gt; that’s also the subject of &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/health"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt; warnings but a synthetic dye named methylene blue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;While he didn’t officially confirm that’s what it was, it’s heavily suggested Robert F.

But not everyone is quite in agreement with that as doctors say the claims could be ‘dangerous’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;It's often used in labs (Getty Stock Image)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is methylene blue?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Originally developed in the 1800s as a textile dye, the substance was found to have niche medical uses and was first used to treat malaria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It’s also had uses for cyanide poisoning, the rare blood disorder called methemoglobinemia and can be used by surgeons to highlight abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;But then it’s also used to treat parasites in fish as well as aquatic ailments like swim bladder disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It’s still used industrially in some cases, as a synthetic dye for textiles and the likes of printing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Yet there are wellness influencers who suggest it’s one of the ‘best kept secrets in biohacking’ and can be a ‘game changer for mental clarity and longevity’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the claimed benefits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Some studies show methylene blue can alleviate mental health issues, with a 2011 trial finding improvements in bipolar disorder symptoms, a 1987 US study indicating it could help with severe depression and a 2020 Chinese study suggesting it may help with Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It’s speculated that the stuff could slow down ageing and improve brain function but many of these studies used small sample sizes. Some even think it can stave off jet lag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Mel Gibson and &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/joe-rogan"&gt;Joe Rogan&lt;/a&gt; even discussed the stuff on &lt;em&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt;, claiming ‘this stuff works’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Rogan said at one point that he takes the stuff daily, thanking RFK Jr as he reckons the stuff has ‘profound effects on your mitochondria’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Meanwhile, US podcaster Gabby Reece previously said she'd been trying methylene blue ‘in different scenarios’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;A number of celebrities and influencers have praised the stuff (Getty Stock Image)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the risks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;With many of the claims of benefits unsupported, many experts warn against using methylene blue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Neuroscientist Anne-Sophie Fluri &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-14795783/doctors-verdict-longevity-elixir-Joe-Rogan-RFK-Jr-swear-reverses-aging.html"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Daily Mail: “Without solid evidence in humans, these claims are at best speculative and at worst potentially dangerous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Experts have reportedly found that recreational use of the substance can lead to serious complications, including seizures or destruction of red blood cells in vulnerable people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“The brain is not a machine you can casually 'optimise' like a smartphone,” Fluri added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Another danger of methylene blue is serotonin syndrome which is rare but potentially serious. This occurs when the levels of serotonin in your brain become too high, usually happening if you take antidepressants in combination with another medicine or substance. Symptoms include confusion, agitation, muscle twitching, sweating, shivering and diarrhoea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;And, if anything, too much of the stuff can turn your wee blue and that’s surely never a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Self-experimentation with methylene blue is heavily warned against and you should consult a doctor if you’re considering using it for any health purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 13:46:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxQM2pQRDQtalBfTE5taFAxNW9wczQ0UmktbXNhVzg0RXo5bUNvaVg2czdlMG04YW9NQ0Fnc1NVOG5RdnR0NEZTekRqdXZRNXNpcUtzc2FuR2xOZVMzMjdiSW1wX181Z0luODJLU09LUElpbG1WUnNvS1lTUHNfUmFWRmEyVkxXMy1iRG5neThadkdGUktVOWR0VmZoTXdqbWNoRmZsQw</guid></item><item><title>研究发现了我们不知道的剧烈运动的潜在缺点- ScienceAlert | Study Finds a Potential Downside to Vigorous Exercise That We Didn't Know About - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNSEN4U3ZZVkh3QmpRekIzOGY3NW15R2prY2ZqYk5CbzFwNldZVjl1YTVnLU9WNzQyWWNFNnpQVlBqbWdCbnhaVTNPRmdVVHVITm5sRWhXRFdwUmlTZHFKWTVpcDlBMUc3dVFTVU9wNzl1em05WUV0UXotNDdncHBzUWZBMjZlbUJyMVVuT1JkaEpDc0dkYmJiLUJtY2YzMkEza1NCVE1jUGczYXM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Bad news for extreme exercise junkies out there: too much vigorous exercise could temporarily make your immune system less efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At least, that's what the evidence shows. An analysis from 2023 of over 4,700&lt;/span&gt; post-exercise fluid molecules from firefighters suggests workers who require intense fitness training, such as emergency workers and athletes, may put themselves at risk of some illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People who are very fit might be more prone to viral respiratory infection immediately after vigorous exercise," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1007461"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) biomedical scientist Ernesto Nakayasu. "Having less inflammatory activity to fight off an infection could be one cause."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the following video for a summary of the study's findings:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32139352/"&gt;strong evidence&lt;/a&gt; to suggest that moderate physical activity among healthy individuals &lt;a href="https://ashpublications.org/bloodadvances/article/4/8/1801/454550/Impact-of-exercise-on-the-immune-system-and"&gt;can favor the immune system&lt;/a&gt; in the long run, what happens to the immune system directly following vigorous exercise is &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5911985/"&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is little reliable evidence that supports the claim that intense exercise heightens the risk of opportunistic infections, although a few &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16558471"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2266764/"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1249/MSS.0b013e318243253d"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; self-reported upper tract respiratory infections in athletes, compared to control groups, after strenuous activities. Whether these are correlations or causations is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Nakayasu and colleagues tested the blood plasma, urine, and saliva, from 11 firefighters before and after 45 minutes of intense exercise hauling up to 20 kilograms (44 pounds) of gear over hilly terrain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143822" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143822" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/CarryingGearUpHill642.jpg" alt="People carrying gear up a hill" class="size-full wp-image-143822" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/CarryingGearUpHill642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/CarryingGearUpHill642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/CarryingGearUpHill642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143822" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;People who are very fit might be more prone to viral respiratory infection immediately after vigorous exercise.

"Perhaps we can reduce the risk of strenuous exercise for first responders, athletes, and members of the military."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no question exercise does wonders for our health, from boosting moods to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/exercise-might-delay-the-spread-of-cancer-by-fuelling-the-immune-system"&gt;strengthening our immune systems&lt;/a&gt;. But as in previous studies, the new research detected possible signs of immune suppression within the worked-out firefighters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amidst the expected physical changes helping our bodies maintain the increase in fluids, energy, and oxygen that exercise demands, there was a decrease in molecules involved in inflammation. This was accompanied by increased &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opiorphin"&gt;opiorphin&lt;/a&gt;, a dilator of peripheral blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What these changes ultimately mean for the short-term function of the immune system is unclear, but the researchers have a few ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"[Opiorphin] may increase blood flow to muscles during the exercise regimen to improve the delivery of oxygen and nutrients," the team &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40779-023-00477-5"&gt;writes in their paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We postulate that the decrease in inflammatory molecules we observed in the saliva after exercise might represent an adaptive mechanism to improve gas exchange in response to higher cellular oxygen demand."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143821" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143821" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ManWorkingOut642.jpg" alt="A man using battle ropes" class="size-full wp-image-143821" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ManWorkingOut642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ManWorkingOut642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ManWorkingOut642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143821" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;There's no question exercise does wonders for our health. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADt-FxXAaE/"&gt;Ugur Karakoc/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was change in the participants' oral microbiome too. The scientists suspect this was due to the increase in antimicrobial peptides found in the firefighter's mouths after their intense activity, possibly to compensate for the immune suppression, although this conclusion is &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5911985/"&gt;contested&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, this increase in antimicrobial peptides had no effect on inhibiting &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; growth," Nakayasu and colleagues &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40779-023-00477-5"&gt;elaborate&lt;/a&gt;, "suggesting a limited capacity of antimicrobial peptides within the oral cavity to protect against host infections."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, other scientists argue some of the changes observed may not be indications of immune suppression but of a "&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5911985/"&gt;heightened state of immune surveillance and immune regulation&lt;/a&gt;".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a within-subject comparison reduced the impact of their small sample size, firefighters experience unique exposures to pollutants during fires which may also change their immune reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, this study only considered healthy and active men, the researchers cautioned, so further research amongst a broader community is needed to confirm their findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, taken with previous studies, "there is evidence supporting a relationship between physical demands and a higher incidence of respiratory infections," Nakayasu and team &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40779-023-00477-5"&gt;conclude&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s40779-023-00477-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Military Medical Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in November 2023&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For far too long, the health, happiness, and well-being of our Nation’s men have been neglected, contributing to a troubling reality: men in the United States have a life expectancy five years shorter than women. They visit healthcare providers less frequently and often delay critical care. Men tend to have their first heart attack an average of 10 years earlier than women.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This neglect has been compounded by a vicious campaign against masculinity. This war on manhood has left many American men in a state of loneliness, confusion, and emptiness, with devastating consequences: men in the United States are four times more likely to commit suicide and more than twice as likely to overdose than women.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This National Men’s Health Week, I make a solemn pledge to honor the men in America: we will always have your back—and we will never waver in our promise to embolden you to lead long, healthy, and safe lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just last month, I proudly signed an Executive Order to deliver most-favored-nation pricing to American patients, improve access to quality medical care, and lower the price of medications.  Together, with my Make America Healthy Again Commission, we are empowering men to prioritize their health and prolong their lives. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under my leadership, we will relentlessly pursue a healthier future for the men of our nation. We will always lift you up rather than tear you down, and we will champion the voices, values, and wellness of hardworking American men across our country.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

That's why so many parents opt to blend extra veggies into pasta sauces and other dishes where they may be less noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-240ca7" class="body-graf"&gt;Luckily, there's one highly nutritious superfood that many parents overlook and is enjoyable for many kids' palates, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/20/harvard-pediatrician-the-overlooked-superfood-more-parents-need-to-feed-kids.html" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Kelly Fradin recently told CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. Not to mention it's versatile — it comes in many varieties and can be served as a side, blended into sauces and dressings, or even eaten as a meat replacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-24b9ba" class="body-heading"&gt;Pediatrician Tip of the Day: Add More Beans to Your Kid's Diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd34ec" class="body-graf"&gt;"Many parents already know the importance of feeding kids vegetables and limiting added sugar," Fradin explained. "We often discuss 'eating the rainbow,' emphasizing the need for a diverse range of colorful fruits and vegetables. Parents frequently prioritize dark leafy greens, antioxidant-rich blueberries and healthy-fat-packed avocados."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6011bd" class="body-graf"&gt;"However, there’s one nutritional powerhouse that often gets overlooked: beans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-ef3d29" class="body-heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b14ff4" class="body-graf"&gt;Beans are one of the top sources of plant-based protein. Plus, many beans are &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/complete-protein-foods-rcna199150" target="_blank"&gt;complete proteins&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they contain all nine essential amino acids, Fradin noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ebbc3c" class="body-graf"&gt;They're also high in fiber, which can improve gut health and reduce blood sugar spikes, keeping energy levels stable. Beans pack in some important micronutrients, too, such as folate, magnesium and B vitamins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bf565d" class="body-graf"&gt;Last, beans are affordable and have a long shelf life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-70b35c" class="body-heading"&gt;How to Get Started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e3f3f8" class="body-graf"&gt;Fradin said that, in her experience, many kids genuinely enjoy the taste and texture of beans. Here are some of her ideas to introduce your kids to this surprising superfood:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-fd396d" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Steam edamame and serve them as a snack.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Put beans in a quesadilla with cheese.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mix black beans into brownies to add some nutritional value.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add beans to chili, stew and soup recipes your kids already know and love.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For more adventurous eaters, try lentil soup.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-795a39" class="body-graf"&gt;"There’s a bean recipe out there for everyone," Fradin added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-242910" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/expert-tip-of-the-day" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TODAY’s Expert Tip of the Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; series is all about simple strategies to make life a little easier.

Recently I was at the doctor and for medical reasons, and she flushed my ears with water. I was startled by how deeply good it felt to have touch inside my ears, and I unexpectedly orgasmed. She thought I was in pain, and I went along with that explanation because I was so embarrassed. I never want to orgasm at the doctor again, obviously. Any tips on how to separate this out? I want to keep things clinical if I have to get it done medically again, but I’d love to have a safe and direct route to orgasm at home. I feel so torn realizing that actually I can come easily, but that the route there is … weird and potentially unsafe. Is something wrong with my body? That is not an erogenous zone!&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, ear eroticism is common enough that there are loads of articles about it. The vagus nerve, which passes through the ear, has been known to be associated with orgasm, particularly vaginal orgasm, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/3100379.pdf?origin=ppub"&gt;since at least the ’90s&lt;/a&gt;. Studies largely &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006899304011461"&gt;focus on women with spinal cord injuries&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s a good data point. You are not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

That means no blowing canned air into your ears, and no digging around with Q-tips.&lt;/p&gt;

They’ve probably heard of cases of pleasure during ear flushing, if not seen it themselves in clinical practice. They can give you medical level information about how to safely stimulate your ears, or at least reduce the risk of harm. If that’s too vulnerable for you, you might inquire about how to flush your ears at home safely. Good luck.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="131" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2f6tp002e3b6huerr8lnu@published"&gt;Before the pandemic started, I finally came to terms with my near exclusive attraction to other women after two years of hooking up with men. I’m happy and confident with this transition, but I’ve encountered a new struggle in my sex life: I’m an average-height, 240-pound woman who wants to wrestle and be physically dominated in bed. Due to my size and people-pleasing nature, I usually get stuck in a more dominant position with my partners. I’m happy to please others, but I don’t get much personal satisfaction when I’m not restrained. This feels shitty to say when my date, while otherwise attractive, doesn’t have the physical means to hold me down. How can I communicate this desire with potential partners? Can I only date women bigger or stronger than me?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2f6tq002h3b6hsga7zbyw@published"&gt;The part of your message where you say you don’t get much direct satisfaction when you aren’t restrained feels pretty crucial. It’s OK to have specific sexual desires and to seek out partners who can and want to meet those desires. Your enjoyment and fulfillment are as important as your partners’ are. Meanwhile, it sounds like you do get something out of fulfilling your partners’ sexual desires, even when that requires taking the active or dominant role, and if that’s the case you should continue to do so to your heart’s content.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="64" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2f6tq002i3b6h36ykp68l@published"&gt;Taking turns, or switching (as your sign-off suggests) is a great instinct. You can satisfy your partner in the way that feels best for them, and then be satisfied in the way that feels best for you. The roles you play during sex are just that—roles. They can be as temporary as you want them to be, and you can switch them as desired.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="174" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2f6tq002j3b6h3tzluiwh@published"&gt;Have you considered restraint with objects? Rope, cuffs, and tape are all popular options. The benefit of this kind of bondage is that it enables one person to restrain another regardless of how large or strong they are and for longer than human endurance lasts. If the restraints are thoroughly applied, you can pull and thrash against them in a way that you might be hesitant to with a person out of fear of hurting them. All of these methods require that your top be cautious about how tightly they’re restraining you and that you check in with your body yourself—specifically any restrained part—to make sure your circulation isn’t cut off. Bondage is inherently risky, and you’ll want to do some research before deciding if you’d like to try it. You’ll also want to be cautious with who you’re allowing to restrain you. Do you know them? Do they have experience and knowledge on mitigating the risks? Establish trust, rapport, and effective communication before proceeding with anything that you can’t immediately extricate yourself from.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="62" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2f6tr002k3b6hwu3fknrq@published"&gt;You may be able to enjoy wrestling with people who aren’t as strong as you are by exercising your ability to pretend. Even with a person twice your size, you aren’t going to full-on fight them the way you would an attacker. There’s already an element of fantasy at work for this kind of interaction to be safe enough to engage in.&lt;/p&gt;

If that’s the case, remember that your desires are OK. You can give yourself permission to seek out people who are able and want to meet your desires. Lots of people prefer certain body types or have a tendency toward certain physical characteristics. You get to have preferences too.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="261" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2st05000d3b6itg5d1fur@published"&gt;For most of high school, I assumed that my hormones were just on backorder and that I was a really late bloomer. However, I’m in college now, and I’m realizing that I’m probably asexual but heteroromantic. It was a relief when I first found out this was “a thing”—I always felt self-conscious because I never really got the appeal of sex, and I thought there was something wrong with me. However, I’m starting to realize how incredibly hard it’s going to be to date guys. I’m not sex-repulsed, just kind of &lt;em&gt;meh&lt;/em&gt; on the topic. I could foresee myself maybe having sex with someone if I really liked them, but that wouldn’t be for a very long time. All of that goes to say that I’m not sure how to date or even if it’s morally OK for me to date. It doesn’t seem fair to deprive someone of sex just because I’m not into it, and it’s pretty hard to find other people who have no particular interest in sex but still want a relationship. The only solution I can think of is maybe nonmonogamy, but I don’t know how I’d feel about that in a long-term relationship. I would love to get married someday, but I can’t see how that’s possible without sex. Do I just have to suck it up and realize that I can’t always get what I want, that dating this way isn’t fair to others, and throw myself into fulfilling friendships instead of love? Or is there some way for me to move around this?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2sszu00093b6ivt03dre1@published"&gt;Yes, you’re overthinking this. I’m guessing that you’ve been through a large process of life planning recently—what you want to study, informed by what direction you want your career to take—and I’m wondering if you’re feeling pressure to figure out the romantic aspect of your life in the grand sense, too. If that’s the case, you might consider giving yourself a break. You don’t have to have it all figured out right now. It seems like you’re currently borrowing a lot of frustration from your potential future self.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="116" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2st0b000e3b6iqm0fouae@published"&gt;You’re correct that the majority of people &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; allosexual—meaning they regularly experience sexual attraction. So yes, you’ll encounter more people who are frequently aroused than those who rarely or never want sex. The thing is that most of us allosexuals have criteria—based on sexual orientation, faith or political beliefs, and aesthetic preferences—that drastically narrow the field of possible mates. And a person being allosexual doesn’t necessarily mean that sex, or frequent sex, is something they require. It isn’t so much that you can’t always get what you want, as it is that—like most people—you’ll have to spend significant time looking. You’ll also probably experience rejection, disappointment, and hurt along the way. It’s part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;

These are all things worth contemplating, without needing to have any answers or decisions right now.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbs2tk88000r3b6iw2orbtqu@published"&gt;I have never really enjoyed sex in all the years I’ve been doing it and with all the partners I’ve had. I don’t feel horny, I don’t masturbate, and it doesn’t feel good to me. I’ve just always done it because that’s what you’re supposed to do in a relationship. As I get older, I find myself wanting to go along with it less and less. My partner has their “required minimum” times per week that is acceptable. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/01/do-not-enjoy-sex-partner-wants-advice.html"&gt;Any less than that, they are miserable (their words). &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;We should all be checking our feet and toenails regularly as they play a 'huge role' in our overall health, a doctor said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Yellow discolouration (left) could indicate a toenail infection while dark nail stripes (right) could signal a type of skin cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead sciencetech-ccox"&gt;YELLOW DISCOLOURATION&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can indicate a toenail infection, Ms Bagga explained, and it can occur on any part of the nail. It causes the nail to discolour, become crumbly or thicken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another cause can be nail psoriasis, where the nail plate can become pitted with patches or lift up from the nail bed underneath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To help prevent toenail infections, it's good practice to keep your nails short, clean, and tidy, she advised. It's also important to wear a clean pair of socks every day and wear shoes that fit correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead sciencetech-ccox"&gt;DARK NAIL STRIPES&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is known as Melanonychia, which can appear as a brown or black band running lengthwise along the nail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most of the time it is simply a normal variation in the pigmentation of the nail. However, in some rare cases, it is a tell-tale sign of Subungual Melanoma, a type of skin cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'To help prevent Melanonychia, it's crucial to focus on good nail and foot hygiene,' Ms Bagga said. 'You also want to try and avoid any nail trauma - if you do injure your nail, allow it to fully heal properly and avoid picking at it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A mother-of-one is urging people not to ignore mysterious marks on nails after what she thought was a simple bruise turned out to be a deadly form of cancer . Laura Jennings, 40, from Leeds, first noticed a dark streak beneath her toenail in April 2022, but thought nothing of it. It turned out to be a deadly form of skin cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Swollen toes could indicate gout, which is more likely to occur in people who are overweight, while white spots on the nails can be caused by a deficiency of protein, zinc or iron&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead sciencetech-ccox"&gt;SWOLLEN TOES&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can be caused by a number of conditions including lymphatic issues, poor blood flow, or even gout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Gout is a type of inflammatory arthritis characterised by sudden, severe joint pain, often in the big toe, caused by the buildup of uric acid crystals in the joints. It is more likely to occur in people who are overweight, and consuming a healthy diet that aids weight loss can help manage the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile there are less serious causes of toe swelling such as sitting or standing for long periods of time, wearing shoes that are too small, being overweight, dehydrated, or eating a diet that's heavy in salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Maintaining a healthy, balanced diet can help with some of these common issues, along with regular exercise and movement,' Ms Bagga advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead sciencetech-ccox"&gt;WHITE TOENAILS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;White lines or spots on the nail. also called 'leukonychia', are often caused by trauma such as stubbing your toe. However sometimes they can be a sign of deficiencies in protein, zinc, or iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although rare, fully white nails are slightly more concerning and could be an indicator of a systematic illness in another part of the body, Ms Bagga warned, including liver cirrhosis, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;If your toes feel unusually cold and lose their colour (left) it could be a sign they are not getting proper circulation. Meanwhile Athletes Foot is a common fungal infection that shows as itchy white patches between your toes (right)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead sciencetech-ccox"&gt;BLUE DISCOLOURATION&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If your nails have a bluish hue and you notice that your toes feel unusually cold, it may be a sign that they are not getting proper circulation, Ms Bagga said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a common symptom of a condition called Raynaud's disease, which causes narrowing of the smaller arteries which supply blood to the extremities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Regular exercise can help improve blood circulation, which can be beneficial for managing the symptoms of Raynaud's, alongside helping you maintain a healthy weight,' she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead sciencetech-ccox"&gt;ITCHY TOES&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Athletes Foot is a common fungal infection that shows as itchy white patches between your toes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also affect the soles or sides of your feet, sometimes causing fluid-filled blisters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To help prevent Athlete's Foot, make sure to completely dry your feet after washing them, especially between your toes, Ms Bagga said, as well as wearing clean socks every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;If nails change shape or look curved and 'spoon'-like it could indicate an iron deficiency or aneamia, the doctor said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead sciencetech-ccox"&gt;ULCERS ON TOES OR FEET&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike a blister that occurs under the skin, an ulcer is a break in the skin's surface, appearing as an open wound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's very important that these are looked after to reduce any risks of infection, the doctor warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'During the time the wound is exposed, it can leave you vulnerable to developing an infection, which in serious cases can lead to amputation,' Ms Bagga said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead sciencetech-ccox"&gt;SPOON NAILS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Bagga advised that people inspect their toenails on a regular basis, as if they start to change shape and look curved or 'spoon'-like, it could indicate an iron deficiency or anaemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Iron is essential for producing healthy red blood cells and maintaining proper nail health, so it's important to speak to a healthcare provider who may recommend taking a supplement, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;mol-permabox id="mol-67ac8900-4841-11f0-8dda-05c9819dbfad"&gt;&lt;div class=" mol-factbox sciencetech art-ins" data-version="2" id="mol-41d464b0-8dbb-11e9-aef0-fdb94fbba61e" data-permabox-url="/health/fb-7137041/WHAT-INGROWN-TOENAIL.html"&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An ingrown toenail is a 'common' problem that occurs when the nail grows into the toe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An affected digit may be red, painful or swollen. The nail may also curve into the toe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Signs of an infection include pus oozing out of the toe and feeling hot or shivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ingrown nails can usually be treated at home by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Soaking the foot in warm water three-to-four times a day for a few days to soften the skin and stop the nail growing into it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping the foot dry for the rest of the day&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wearing wide, comfortable shoes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Taking painkillers if necessary &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ingrown-toenail/"&gt;NHS &lt;/a&gt;advises we leave the nail to grow out rather than cutting or picking at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If the at-home treatment does not work, or the toe is painful or appears to be infected, see a GP. Patients should also seek the help of a doctor if they have a fever or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A foot specialist may then cut away part of the nail or remove it entirely. A local anaesthetic will first be applied to numb the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ingrown toenails can be prevented by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mol-bullets-with-font"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not cutting nails too short&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cutting straight across the nail rather than at the edges&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class=""&gt;Not wearing shoes that are too tight or do not fit properly &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/mol-permabox&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 11:06:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxNUy1rTlVMeXQtU1J3Sk00ZU9wdjl5R2R4RXpMMFZCSGd2TUtRNmpHSkd2dzZsd3d6QUV3dmU5YzYzNFZ1c1JXMk1LQnc5OE9BaXRXMWt6R01zeWNQRjlIQ0FUSGYyRi1DNVIwb0hjeXBPYnJEbDIxeGRSQ213aUM5T21zMUh0dmtMMXhYSGtnS2lyZDJsZXFWZnpzVFdyeTNmSmZj</guid></item><item><title>透露：根据专家的说法，您的脚趾甲对您有什么影响-每日邮报 | Revealed: What your TOENAILS say about you, according to experts - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxNUy1rTlVMeXQtU1J3Sk00ZU9wdjl5R2R4RXpMMFZCSGd2TUtRNmpHSkd2dzZsd3d6QUV3dmU5YzYzNFZ1c1JXMk1LQnc5OE9BaXRXMWt6R01zeWNQRjlIQ0FUSGYyRi1DNVIwb0hjeXBPYnJEbDIxeGRSQ213aUM5T21zMUh0dmtMMXhYSGtnS2lyZDJsZXFWZnpzVFdyeTNmSmZj0gGoAUFVX3lxTE1xWkp6ZXhMZV9BVVZ0WjRFcG5nekYtUTd4YVhDc0xpc0taaGF5bW1kMjUwWV9fUnBiQnk0amZ4a2JGY3ZrZGxrYmlUZ3hkU2QxWi1KdXBNTTZxU0pZaEtVRnNzdExkT0lINXFqWC1BWUIyUWtXdmJEcEwwTWxfRGZlMnE4QnJkM2NLSDByenNVSG1LdzlsZDY0VFMzZXRNR3Q3TVFJNFBnbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You probably don't pay them much attention on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But your toenails could tell you a lot about your health, a doctor has revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whether it's nutritional deficiencies, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-aeddc5e0-483d-11f0-8dda-05c9819dbfad"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; or circulatory issues, checking the condition of your nails could highlight issues such as infections, diabetes or even &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-aedd0290-483d-11f0-8dda-05c9819dbfad"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sheena Bagga, a pharmacist prescriber from &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://onlinedoctor.lloydspharmacy.com/uk/lifestyle-advice/health-trends-calendar"&gt;LloydsPharmacy Online Doctor&lt;/a&gt;, has revealed everything you need to know about toe and nail health – and eight symptoms to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While often overlooked, your toenails and feet play a huge role in your overall health and it's important to pay attention to their condition,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While everyone's toes look different, healthy nails should have a smooth surface with light pink or translucent colouration without much variation in shade or hue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While a lot of the time problems with toes and nails are easily treated, if you are facing symptoms due to issues such as diabetes, poor circulation, or nutritional deficiencies, consuming a healthy, balanced diet is crucial to support your overall health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, do you recognise any of these symptoms?&lt;/p&gt;

Patients should also seek the help of a doctor if they have a fever or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A foot specialist may then cut away part of the nail or remove it entirely.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SpaceX tries something new with Falcon 9. &lt;/b&gt;With nearly 500 launches under its belt, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket isn't often up to new tricks. But the company tried something new following a launch June 7 with a radio broadcasting satellite for SiriusXM. The Falcon 9's upper stage placed the SXM-10 satellite into an elongated, high-altitude transfer orbit, as is typical for payloads destined to operate in geosynchronous orbit more than 22,000 miles (nearly 36,000 kilometers) over the equator. When a rocket releases a satellite in this type of high-energy orbit, the upper stage has usually burned almost all of its propellant, leaving little fuel left over to steer itself back into Earth's atmosphere for a destructive reentry. This means these upper stages often remain in space for decades, becoming a piece of space junk transiting across the orbits of many other satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now, a solution &lt;/em&gt;... SpaceX usually deorbits rockets after they deploy payloads like Starlink satellites into low-Earth orbit, but deorbiting a rocket from a much higher geosynchronous transfer orbit is a different matter. "Last week, SpaceX successfully completed a controlled deorbit of the SiriusXM-10 upper stage after GTO payload deployment," wrote Jon Edwards, SpaceX's vice president of Falcon and Dragon programs. "While we routinely do controlled deorbits for LEO stages (e.g., Starlink), deorbiting from GTO is extremely difficult due to the high energy needed to alter the orbit, making this a rare and remarkable first for us. This was only made possible due to the hard work and brilliance of the Falcon GNC (guidance, navigation, and control) team and exemplifies SpaceX's commitment to leading in both space exploration and public safety."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;New Glenn gets a tentative launch date. &lt;/b&gt;Five months have passed since Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket made its mostly successful debut in January. At one point the company targeted "late spring" for the second launch of the rocket. However, on Monday, Blue Origin's CEO, Dave Limp, acknowledged on social media that the rocket's next flight will now no longer take place until at least August 15, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/06/second-new-glenn-launch-slips-toward-fall-as-program-leadership-departs/"&gt;Ars reports&lt;/a&gt;. Although he did not say so, this may well be the only other New Glenn launch this year. The mission, with an undesignated payload, will be named "Never Tell Me the Odds," due to the attempt to land the booster. "One of our key mission objectives will be to land and recover the booster," &lt;a href="https://x.com/davill/status/1932113352714825833"&gt;Limp wrote&lt;/a&gt;. "This will take a little bit of luck and a lot of excellent execution. We’re on track to produce eight GS2s [second stages] this year, and the one we’ll fly on this second mission was hot-fired in April."&lt;/p&gt;

Study authors also published their findings in &lt;em&gt;Current Developments in Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s break down what they found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Was This Study Conducted?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers drew data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a 30-year study that started in 1985. It included 4,654 adults, almost 55% women, with an average age of 25 when the study began—also called the baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants’ diets were assessed at baseline and again at years 7 and 20. Specifically, researchers were looking for the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290373/a-buyers-guide-to-sugar-substitutes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cumulative average intake of artificial sweeteners;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;cumulative average intake of artificial sweeteners&lt;/a&gt;, diet beverages, aspartame and sucralose. Participants were placed into categories, called quintiles, based on their intake of these substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers were also looking for diabetes diagnoses over the 30 years of follow-up, of which there were 691 cases. They defined diabetes as a &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290761/best-time-to-check-blood-glucose-after-meal/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fasting glucose higher than 126 mg/dL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;fasting glucose higher than 126 mg/dL&lt;/a&gt;, glucose 200 mg/dL or higher after a glucose tolerance test, A1C higher than 6.5%, or the use of diabetes medications at follow-up visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Did This Study Show?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistical analyses were adjusted for certain demographics, including age, sex, race, education, energy intake, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol intake, diet quality and family history of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who consumed the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8043120/trader-joes-best-beverages-for-diabetes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:most diet beverages;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;most diet beverages&lt;/a&gt; had a 129% higher risk of diabetes compared to those who drank the least diet beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to those with lower intakes, those with the highest intake of saccharin, an artificial sweetener sometimes found in diet drinks, had a 110% increased risk of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Does This Apply to Real Life?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know it’s important to limit sugar, and beverages sweetened with sugar can be a major contributor of added sugar in our diets. But this study suggests that replacing regular sodas and other sweetened beverages with diet ones may not benefit you in the ways you’re hoping. It also suggests that they may even significantly raise your risk of developing diabetes—exactly the opposite of what you might think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientific community has gone back and forth on the safety of artificial sweeteners. And while the FDA lists artificial sweeteners as “generally recognized as safe,” we also know that research is mixed on sugar substitutes—particularly &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/are-artificial-sweeteners-bad-for-you-8431961" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:when it comes to your gut health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;when it comes to your gut health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study didn’t include sugar alcohols, a type of artificial sweetener, but &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/new-study-links-erythritol-with-higher-blood-clot-risk-8695390" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:other studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt; have shown that they, too, may pose some risk, including for blood clots, which increase the &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bad-foods-to-eat-for-lower-stroke-risk-11722148" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:risk of stroke and heart attack;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;risk of stroke and heart attack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study raises a lot of questions, which is a good thing with research. We still need more information to know if it’s only the artificial sweeteners raising the risk of diabetes, or if it's the combination of artificial sweeteners with other additives in the beverages. We also can’t know for sure if other additives in the drinks increase diabetes risk on their own, or if it’s a combination of the diet drinks and a poor diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite all these questions, here’s what we do know. Soda is far from being a whole food, but everything can fit in a varied and balanced eating pattern. Having a soda now and then is probably fine for most people. The key is how regularly you’re taking a soda break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you lean on your favorite fizzy pop to get you through a midafternoon slump, consider replacing it with an &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/energizing-nut-free-snack-recipes-8549709" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:energizing snack;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;energizing snack&lt;/a&gt;, like some nuts and cheese for a mix of &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/proteins-to-eat-every-week-11684415" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:protein and healthy fats;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;protein and healthy fats&lt;/a&gt;. You could even take a quick walk or do some pushups against your desk to get your blood pumping. Changing your physiology is one of the quickest ways to change your energy state. And making sure you’re staying well-hydrated and well-fueled may help prevent the slump to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you like soda for the bubbles, consider replacing it with an unsweetened &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8052890/sparkling-water-soda-water-club-soda-seltzer-water-mineral-water-tonic-whats-the-difference/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sparkling water;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sparkling water&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll get all of the fizz without the additives that soda contains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study suggests that those who drink high amounts of diet sodas and other diet beverages may significantly increase their risk of diabetes. Soda, whether sweetened with sugar or artificial sweeteners, may be a delicious option now and then, but should probably not be a regular on anyone’s menu. If you’re a regular soda imbiber, begin replacing one soda a day with &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/this-gut-friendly-soda-is-my-go-to-drink-for-dry-january-8772967" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:natural beverages;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;natural beverages&lt;/a&gt;, including water, sparkling water or unsweetened tea.

The drug helped restore more normal sleep patterns and limited the buildup of tau, a protein known to damage neurons. The findings raise the possibility that medications targeting the brain’s sleep-wake system could one day help prevent or slow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is marked by memory loss, cognitive decline, and shrinking of brain tissue over time. One of its key features is the buildup of tau, a protein that normally helps stabilize the internal structure of brain cells. In Alzheimer’s, tau becomes chemically altered in a way that causes it to clump together and form tangles inside neurons. These tangles disrupt communication between brain cells and contribute to their eventual death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although sleep disturbances are common in Alzheimer’s, researchers are increasingly viewing poor sleep not just as a symptom of the disease, but as a possible contributing factor to its progression. A growing body of research has linked reduced time spent in restorative non-REM and REM sleep to a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative conditions. One of the mechanisms thought to underlie this relationship involves a system in the brain that helps regulate wakefulness, known as orexin signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Orexin is a neuropeptide produced in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. It plays a central role in keeping us awake and alert by stimulating activity in wake-promoting areas of the brain. In healthy individuals, orexin levels rise during the day to promote alertness and fall at night to allow sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in people with sleep disturbances—and in animal models of Alzheimer’s—orexin signaling can become overactive, contributing to fragmented sleep and increased time spent awake. Notably, orexin-producing neurons are among the earliest to show damage in Alzheimer’s and related tau disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Investigating the role of orexin signaling as a potential therapeutic treatment for pathological tau was the next step in a broader line of investigation the lab has been following for a while. We have known that sleep loss is a risk for Alzheimer’s for a long time,” explained study author &lt;a href="https://sleepresearch.wustl.edu/people/samira-parhizkar-phd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Samira Parhizkar&lt;/a&gt;, an instructor of neurology at Washington University in St. Louis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Previously, we had looked into how knocking out orexin receptors affects amyloid pathology, one of the key hallmark proteins in Alzheimer’s disease, in mice. From that, we already knew orexin signaling was tied into sleep regulation and disease processes. But since tau pathology, another key characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease —rather than amyloid—is more tightly linked with actual brain atrophy and cognitive decline, we wanted to shift focus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s where lemborexant came in,” Parhizkar explained. “It’s a clinically approved drug for treating insomnia that blocks orexin receptors – peptides in the brain that keep us awake and alert. We figured if it could normalize sleep, and hit that same orexin pathway, maybe it could also prevent some of the tau-related damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this, the researchers used a genetically engineered mouse model that mimics key features of Alzheimer’s disease. These mice, called P301S/E4 mice, carry both a human tau mutation and the human APOE4 gene, which is the strongest known genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s. These mice begin to show significant tau buildup, brain inflammation, and brain shrinkage by about 9.5 months of age. Importantly, they also show disrupted sleep-wake cycles, making them a useful model for studying the connection between sleep and neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We investigated the effects of lemborexant, which is partially selective for orexin receptor 2 and primarily influences sleep/wake regulation, in the P301S/E4 mouse model of tau-mediated neurodegeneration,” Parhizkar said. “This model exhibits both sleep disturbances and brain atrophy with accumulating tau pathology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared lemborexant’s effects to those of zolpidem, a commonly prescribed sleep aid that works through a different mechanism. Starting at 7.5 months of age, the mice were treated daily with one of the drugs or a control solution. Sleep was measured using both EEG recordings and motion sensors, and brain tissues were analyzed after two months of treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lemborexant increased the amount of non-REM sleep in male mice, especially when administered in the early evening (ZT13). This increase in deep sleep was associated with reduced levels of phosphorylated tau in the brain, especially in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex—regions essential for memory. Immunohistochemistry revealed that mice treated with lemborexant had fewer tau tangles, and biochemical analyses showed a reduction in tau proteins phosphorylated at sites associated with disease progression. Zolpidem, while also promoting sleep, did not significantly reduce tau levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to its effects on tau, lemborexant appeared to protect the brain’s structure and function. Treated mice showed less shrinkage in key brain regions and thicker layers of neurons in the dentate gyrus and piriform cortex. They also had lower levels of neurofilament light chain in the blood, a marker of neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, lemborexant-treated mice retained more synaptic structures, as shown by markers of presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins. These mice also showed reduced microglial activation, suggesting less brain inflammation. The drug appeared to shift microglia—the brain’s immune cells—away from a reactive, potentially damaging state and toward a more homeostatic role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We initially hypothesized that enhancing non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, which is closely linked to deep sleep, could help mitigate the damage caused by abnormal tau in the brain,” Parhizkar told PsyPost. “What was surprising was that these effects were not seen with a standard sleep drug like zolpidem that increases NREM sleep similarly to lemborexant. This suggests that the benefit is not just about more sleep, but rather how that sleep is promoted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand how lemborexant might be reducing tau pathology, the researchers looked at downstream molecular pathways. They found that lemborexant reduced levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and the activity of protein kinase A (PKA), a key enzyme known to phosphorylate tau. This suggests that blocking orexin signaling can suppress a molecular cascade that leads to abnormal tau modification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also tested this idea in a second experiment, using mice genetically engineered to lack orexin receptor 2. When these mice were injected with pathological tau extracted from human Alzheimer’s brains, they showed significantly less tau seeding and spreading compared to normal mice. This effect was similar to that seen in mice treated with lemborexant, reinforcing the idea that orexin receptor 2 plays a key role in tau pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Another surprising finding was that protein kinase A, an enzyme recognized for decades for its role in promoting formation of abnormal tau found in disease states, could be affected by changes in the orexin signaling pathway,” Parhizkar said. “By showing both pharmacologic (lemborexant) and genetic (orexin receptor 2 knockout) approaches having similar effects, the study makes a strong case that orexin signaling may be a modifiable driver of tau pathology, not just a bystander.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the protective effects of lemborexant were mostly seen in male mice. Female mice did not show the same reductions in tau buildup or brain atrophy, despite experiencing similar improvements in sleep. This sex difference is consistent with other studies showing that male and female animals can respond differently to both Alzheimer’s pathology and pharmacological interventions. The reason for this difference remains unclear but may involve hormonal influences or differences in baseline tau accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although lemborexant showed strong protective effects at the molecular and structural levels, its impact on behavior was limited. The only behavioral improvement observed was a modest enhancement in a spontaneous alternation task, which measures exploratory behavior. The lack of improvement in more memory-focused tasks, such as fear conditioning, may be due to the fact that lemborexant’s protective effects were stronger in the entorhinal cortex than in the hippocampus, which is more directly involved in those tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study is the first of its kind to demonstrate that a sleep aid can prevent atrophy in the brain typically observed with build-up of abnormal tau, suggesting that targeting sleep through dual orexin receptor antagonism may have broader therapeutic potential beyond symptom management with potential protective effects on the brain,” Parhizkar told PsyPost. “This opens the door to repurposing orexin antagonists—already approved for insomnia—as a potential disease-modifying therapy in Alzheimer’s and additional tau-related neurodegenerative diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the promising results, there are some limitations to consider. The study was conducted in mice, so it is unclear whether the findings will generalize to humans. The treatment began before significant tau pathology had developed, meaning the drug’s effects on established disease remain unknown. The researchers also did not test other orexin receptor antagonists or explore the long-term effects of treatment beyond two months. Moreover, the reason why only male mice benefited remains to be explored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Significant questions remain before lemborexant could be recommended for preventing Alzheimer’s disease in humans,” Parhizkar noted. “For example, we need more evidence to determine whether long-term use is effective in preventing cognitive decline and which individuals may benefit from it. Although these findings are encouraging, it is still early days. We now have evidence that dual orexin antagonists can influence levels of both amyloid and tau, which could potentially delay the progression of Alzheimer’s disease if treatment begins before or during the early stages of mild cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our team is planning additional studies to better understand the mechanisms behind lemborexant’s protective effects and to explore whether combining different therapeutic approaches might be more effective than current options, either alone or in combination with other available treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-01966-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Lemborexant ameliorates tau-mediated sleep loss and neurodegeneration in males in a mouse model of tauopathy&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Samira Parhizkar, Xin Bao, Wei Chen, Nicholas Rensing, Yun Chen, Michal Kipnis, Sihui Song, Grace Gent, Eric Tycksen, Melissa Manis, Choonghee Lee, Javier Remolina Serrano, Megan E.

These so-called poop transplants have understandably received a lot of attention, but new research casts a bit of a wet blanket over the practice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The procedure involves taking microbes from the poop of a healthy person and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/need-a-fecal-transplant-theres-a-poop-bank-for-that-1521772837"&gt;&lt;span&gt;transferring them into a patient’s colon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This should restore balance to their gut microbiome, but according to a study published June 6 in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00564-1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, transplanted microbes may colonize the wrong parts of the digestive system. This can result in long-lasting &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/fecal-transplant-patient-killed-by-superbug-traced-to-d-1835521476"&gt;&lt;span&gt;unintended health consequences&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the researchers warn.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;aside class="pullquote text-center"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think it’s a bit of a wakeup call to the field that maybe we shouldn’t willy-nilly put large bowel microbes into different parts of the intestine that shouldn’t be there.”&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/aside&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I think it’s a bit of a wakeup call to the field that maybe we shouldn’t willy-nilly put large bowel microbes into different parts of the intestine that shouldn’t be there,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/fecal-transplants-can-have-unintended-side-effects-study-finds"&gt;&lt;span&gt;said&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; lead author Orlando “Landon” DeLeon, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Chicago, in a statement.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;DeLeon led a team of researchers through a series of experiments on mice to determine how fecal matter transplants affect different parts of the intestine. The mice were separated into three groups. One received microbes from the jejunum (the middle part of the small intestine), the second received microbes from the cecum (a pouch that connects the small intestine to the colon), and the third received a standard fecal transplant from the colon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Each part of the digestive system contains uniquely adapted microbiota. The researchers wanted to see if the microbes would stick to their respective niches once inside the mice. In fact, they found that each of the transplants successfully colonized the full intestinal tract, creating regional gut “mismatches” that lasted for up to three months after the procedure. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Microbes that colonized parts of the gut where they didn’t belong triggered metabolic changes in these intestinal regions, with the potential to affect a patient’s health and behavior. The researchers observed changes in the mice’s eating habits, activity, and energy expenditure following the transplants. They also documented changes in gene activity associated with immune function, which in turn led to changes in liver metabolism. Most surprising was the manner in which these foreign microbes altered gene and protein expression in the intestinal lining to make the mismatched gut region more suitable for them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“It’s like they’re engineering or terraforming their environments to help them fit in,” DeLeon said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To determine whether these mismatches could occur in actual fecal transplant patients, he and his colleagues conducted additional tests using human tissue samples. Results showed that transplanted gut bacteria can colonize parts of the human digestive system where they don’t naturally belong.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If we’re designing good therapeutics, we should be aware of the importance of matching the regional microbiota to their proper environments, so that we provide better overall health benefits,” DeLeon said. For example, the findings suggest it may be safer to use microbes retrieved from all the parts of the digestive system, according to the researchers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/25202-fecal-transplant"&gt;&lt;span&gt;recommends&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; fecal transplants for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-taboo-treatment-how-fecal-transplants-save-lives-5893234"&gt;&lt;span&gt;treating repeated infections of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Clostridium difficile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;, or C. diff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. This bacterium—which can cause severe gastrointestinal symptoms—most commonly sickens hospital patients who have been treated with antibiotics. Fecal transplants have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/medical-advances/science-and-research/how-do-fecal-transplants-work"&gt;&lt;span&gt;proven&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; to be highly effective for treating these infections, and those results have encouraged researchers to investigate other applications for this procedure. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A wave of new research suggests that fecal transplants could treat conditions that go beyond the gut. Indeed, studies have found that this procedure could benefit patients with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10017995/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;neurodevelopmental&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7294648/#:~:text=All%20studies%20found%20a%20decrease,the%20transplantation%20of%20healthy%20microbiota."&gt;&lt;span&gt;psychiatric disorders&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10745313/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, type 2 diabetes, and more. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;DeLeon’s findings suggest that doctors need to better understand the risks of fecal matter transplants before this treatment can be used for diseases other than C. diff. He plans to keep investigating how different microbes affect each part of the intestine and explore ways to restore altered regions to their original state. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This study shows that when it comes to gut microbes, location really matters. Getting the right bugs in the right place could unlock the full potential of fecal transplants.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy, who was an anti-vaccine activist before taking a role in the administration, announced May 27 that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/27/nx-s1-5413179/covid-vaccine-children-pregnant-rfk-cdc" target="_blank"&gt;no longer recommend COVID vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for pregnant women or healthy children, bypassing the agency's formal process for adjusting its vaccine schedules for adults and kids. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The announcement, &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1927368440811008138" target="_blank"&gt;made on the social media platform X&lt;/a&gt;, has been met with outrage by many pediatricians and scientists.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The HHS document meant to support Kennedy's decision, obtained by KFF Health News, was sent to members of Congress, according to Democratic staff on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the office of Rep. Kim Schrier, D-Wash.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Titled "Covid Recommendation FAQ", the document has not been posted on the HHS website, though it is the first detailed explanation of Kennedy's announcement from the agency.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p id="resnx-s1-5431935-101" class="bucketwrap statichtml"&gt;
            
   &lt;/p&gt;
   

   &lt;p&gt;Medical experts who reviewed all the citations in the FAQ said it distorts some legitimate studies and cites others that are disputed and unpublished.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;HHS director of communications Andrew Nixon told KFF Health News: "There is no distortion of the studies in this document. The underlying data speaks for itself, and it raises legitimate safety concerns. HHS will not ignore that evidence or downplay it. We will follow the data and the science."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;HHS did not respond to a request to name the author of the document.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20420986241226566" target="_blank"&gt;One of the studies&lt;/a&gt; the HHS document cites is under investigation by its publisher, Sage Journals, regarding "potential issues with the research methodology and conclusions and author conflicts of interest," according to a link on &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/20420986241239903" target="_blank"&gt;the study's webpage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"This is RFK Jr.'s playbook," said Dr. &lt;a href="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/accords/about/faculty-staff-directory/O-Leary-Sean-UCD11631" target="_blank"&gt;Sean O'Leary&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the Committee on Infectious Diseases for the American Academy of Pediatrics and an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. "Either cherry-pick from good science or take junk science to support his premise — this has been his playbook for 20 years."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Outdated and misinterpreted research about myocarditis and pericarditis&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.20.24306810v1" target="_blank"&gt;study cited&lt;/a&gt; in the document is a preprint that was made available online a year ago, and has still not been published in a peer-reviewed journal. Under the study's title is an alert that "it reports new medical research that has yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-72530" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The FAQ draws on the preprint to claim that "post-marketing studies" of COVID vaccines have identified "serious adverse effects, such as an increased risk of myocarditis and pericarditis" — conditions in which the heart's muscle or its covering, the pericardium, suffer inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;While research early in the pandemic did find that, new research not included in the memo indicates that the risk has fallen with new vaccine protocols.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And the HHS document omitted numerous other &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39404761/" target="_blank"&gt;peer-reviewed&lt;/a&gt; studies that have shown that the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39826014/" target="_blank"&gt;risk of myocarditis&lt;/a&gt; and pericarditis is greater after contracting COVID for both vaccinated and non-vaccinated people than the risk of the same complications after vaccination alone.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One the 2024 preprint coauthors &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2024/08/08/myocarditis-vaccinated-covid-19-oxford-fact-check/74639942007/?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank"&gt;refuted the idea&lt;/a&gt; that their research found myocarditis and pericarditis were caused by the COVID shots, rather than COVID infection, noting that the study did not compare outcomes between people who were vaccinated and those infected with the COVID virus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study also focused only on children and adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;O'Leary said that while some cases of myocarditis were reported in vaccinated adolescent boys and young men early in the COVID pandemic, the rates declined after the two initial doses of COVID vaccines were spaced further apart.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, adolescents and adults who have not been previously vaccinated receive only one shot, and myocarditis no longer shows up in the data, O'Leary said, referring to the CDC's &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety-systems/vsd/index.html#cdc_generic_section_5-access-and-use-vsd-data" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccine Safety Datalink&lt;/a&gt;. "There is no increased risk at this point that we can identify," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Congress relies on health agencies for accurate guidance&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In two instances, the HHS memo makes claims about dangers to pregnant women that are &lt;a href="https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1471-0528.17721" target="_blank"&gt;actively refuted&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/fulltext/2022/04000/in_vitro_fertilization_and_early_pregnancy.3.aspx%C2%A0" target="_blank"&gt;the papers&lt;/a&gt; it cites to back them up. Both papers support the safety and effectiveness of COVID vaccines for pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The HHS document says that another &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X24001270?via%3Dihub#s0090" target="_blank"&gt;paper it cites&lt;/a&gt; found "an increase in placental blood clotting in pregnant mothers who took the vaccine." But the paper doesn't contain any reference to placental blood clots or to pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I've now read it three times. And I cannot find that anywhere," said Turrentine, the OB-GYN professor.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;If he were grading the HHS document, "I would give this an 'F,'" Turrentine said. "This is not supported by anything and it's not using medical evidence."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While members of Congress who are physicians should know to check references in the paper, they may not take the time to do so, said Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/providers/neil-silverman" target="_blank"&gt;Neil Silverman,&lt;/a&gt; a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology who directs the Infectious Diseases in Pregnancy Program at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They're going to assume this is coming from a scientific agency. So they are being hoodwinked along with everyone else who has had access to this document," Silverman said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The offices of three Republicans in Congress who are medical doctors serving on House and Senate committees focused on health, including Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., did not respond to requests for comment about whether they received the memo. Emily Druckman, communications director for Rep. Kim Schrier, D-Wash., a physician serving on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, confirmed that Rep. Schrier's office did receive a copy of the document.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The problem is a lot of legislators and even their staffers, they don't have the expertise to be able to pick those references apart," O'Leary said."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;C.J. Young, deputy communications director for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, confirmed that Democratic staff members of the committee received the document from HHS. In the past, he said, similar documents would help clarify the justification and scope of an administration's policy change and could be assumed to be scientifically accurate, Young said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This feels like it's breaking new ground. I don't think that we saw this level of sloppiness or inattention to detail or lack of consideration for scientific merit under the first Trump administration," Young said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/about-us/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                Pastor Billiance Chondwe has known 9-year-old Diana Lungu since she was born. He helped her mother through a rough pregnancy and during Diana's early years. Diana's mother died of AIDS when Diana was nearing her third birthday.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Night had fallen hours ago, but Billiance Chondwe was not slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On Feb. 20, he frantically tapped out texts on WhatsApp, dialed distant acquaintances and left voice messages from his home in Zambia. He'd pause only to close his eyes and think of whom else he could reach out to for help.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He urgently needed to find medication for Diana Lungu. She's an orphan, she's 9 — and she's HIV-positive. She'd run out of the daily pills she takes to suppress the virus. Without the pills, the virus would surge back.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I called the whole night … calling everyone," remembers Chondwe, 53, a reverend known in his community simply as Pastor Billy. "I slept around 3 a.m."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;One of his messages found its way to Thailand, where Susan Hillis was standing in an airport check-in line. It was the wee hours of the morning there, and she was heading home to the U.S. from a conference of Christian mission hospitals. As she listened to the message, Hillis could sense the exhaustion and fear in Pastor Billy's voice — and she knew how much Diana means to him.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I was about four people from checking in, and I had tears in my eyes and was choked up," recalls Hillis, an epidemiologist who has spent years on HIV/AIDS work. "I was thinking: 'She's going to die. She is going to die.'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was through her work in the faith community that she first connected with Pastor Billy — and learned about Diana, a girl with short cropped hair and a cautious but bright smile.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Over the years, Pastor Billy and his wife, Catherine Nanyangwe Chondwe, have taken more than 15 orphans into their home — raising them for periods of time alongside their own five children. "Some were sleeping in the kitchen, others in the sitting room," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71246" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Diana lost her mother to HIV and her grandmother to COVID-19. She never knew her father. Pastor Billy says whatever stability she has had in her life is in large part thanks to the U.S. government.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Diana stayed with them on and off for four years. There was something different about her, they say&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— a generosity that took them both by surprise. "Maybe there is tea, or there is porridge, but any child nearby — [Diana] would share with them," Pastor Billy says. The same thing happened when they gave her toys.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;An AIDS orphan who is HIV-positive herself, Diana has lost her mother to HIV and her grandmother to COVID-19. She never knew her father. Pastor Billy says whatever stability she has had in her life is in large part thanks to the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Diana's HIV medications and her medical care have been provided by a U.S.-funded clinic with a big salmon-colored gate in her town of Kapiri Mposhi. And a U.S. program supporting AIDS orphans provided Diana with monthly food packages — often fish, beans and cornmeal. Proper nutrition is critical when taking HIV drugs. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;PEPFAR — the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief — paid for all of it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then came inauguration night.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Half a world away, in Washington, D.C., President Trump signed an executive order with a Sharpie, freezing almost all foreign aid. A flurry of stop-work orders followed, as did program terminations for billions of dollars of international health programs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;From one day to the next, Diana's HIV clinic went from providing lifesaving medications to closing its doors. There was no warning and no time to get her medical file and transfer it to another clinic. The monthly package of food also stopped without warning.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By that time, Pastor Billy's church had transferred him to a different town. He'd found someone in Diana's community — Jennifer Mukuka — to welcome her in.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71247" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;"I don't have much, but I just have this big heart," says Mukuka. She has been able to bear the cost of raising Diana because of the aid from PEPFAR, which also covered fees for her school books and uniform.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And that kind of security has given Diana space to dream of her own future. On her 20-minute walk to school — down dusty, craggy roads — she often imagines becoming a doctor, with a white coat and stethoscope, moving from one bedside to the next.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;On that February night — when Pastor Billy reached out to Hillis and almost a dozen others — he had just learned that Diana had run out of her daily HIV medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hillis remembers thinking to herself in that airport line: "If it's happening to her, it's happening to a lot of people."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71518" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;"Successful" and "unsung"&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Diana was one of 6.6 million orphans and vulnerable children supported last year by PEPFAR.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;PEPFAR spokespeople often point out that the program has saved more than 26 million lives since its launch in 2003. And it has also helped children on a massive scale. Starting in 2006 — just a few years after then-President George W. Bush created the initiative — a bipartisan team of Democrats and Republicans made sure that 10% of the funding each year was set aside for AIDS orphans and vulnerable children. Last fiscal year, PEPFAR spent just over $200 million on these youngsters — about $31 per child supported.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;AIDS often kills people in their childbearing years and has left &lt;a href="https://data.unicef.org/topic/hivaids/global-regional-trends/" target="_blank"&gt;millions of orphaned children&lt;/a&gt; in its wake. PEPFAR's vision was to enable local families to take in these orphans by providing basics — not only medicine but also food, clothing and school fees, as well as psychosocial support to address stigma. The program defined orphans as children who had lost one or both parents to AIDS, and the children did not necessarily have HIV themselves. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71250" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                The U.S. government's PEPFAR program provided AIDS orphans with food, clothing, school fees — and medicine if they were HIV-positive, like Diana. Now, without aid, Diana and the family she lives with are scrambling to provide these necessities. Here, Diana eats breakfast before heading to school.

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cfar.ucsf.edu/people/eric-goosby" target="_blank"&gt;Eric Goosby&lt;/a&gt; — the infectious disease physician who oversaw PEPFAR from 2009 to 2013&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— says it's hard to overstate the impact of this program that is at once "very successful" and "largely unsung."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The orphan-and-vulnerable-children response that PEPFAR created was bigger than the Catholic Church, all added up in every country, in terms of the number of orphans saved," says Goosby, now a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. "That was the largest effort on the planet."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now it's mostly on hold.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In an emailed statement, spokesperson for the U.S. State Department said that while HIV treatment and care are allowed to continue, as well as prevention of mother-to-child transmission, "all other PEPFAR-funded services are being reviewed for assessment of programmatic efficiencies and consistency with United States foreign policy."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The department did not respond to NPR's questions about when the review would be completed and what the 6.6 million orphans and vulnerable children, as well as their caregivers, should do in the meantime. The statement did say that children and adults who are both HIV-positive and malnourished can get food support. While Diana has lost her food packages and is often hungry, she is not considered malnourished, according to Pastor Billy and Mukuka.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;How budget negotiations unfold will likely impact which parts of PEPFAR continue.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Everything was stopped, and it's not coming back — except [HIV] treatment," says one U.S. civil servant who has spent years working at high levels on the United States' HIV/AIDS efforts and who requested anonymity because they are concerned that speaking out could harm their career. This civil servant said none of the staff members involved in the orphans program was moved to the State Department when the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) was dismantled as an independent agency.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Since the foreign aid freeze was announced, &lt;a href="https://worldwithoutorphans.org/forum/speaker/susan-hillis" target="_blank"&gt;Hillis&lt;/a&gt; has been reaching out to her network of colleagues and friends all over the world to better understand their situation. That network was built up during the 25 years she spent at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a senior adviser with a focus on HIV and vulnerable children. She then spent seven years at PEPFAR. During Trump's first term, she was picked to lead a $100 million initiative to use faith-based groups to advance HIV/AIDS work. She was let go on the ninth day of Trump's second term.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Between emails, phone calls and text messages, Hillis has been keeping track of the situation on the ground in a variety of countries. "Now, a lot of families with orphans are hungry," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In that airport line in Thailand, Hillis remembers panicking about Diana's fate.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71512" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;"I just thought, 'This little girl's gonna die. She has no chance unless someone can get her medicine in the middle of rural Zambia. Who's gonna do that?'" she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flashing back to the death of his twin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For Pastor Billy, there was a very personal sense of urgency. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Growing up in Kitwe, Zambia, he was one of 13 children. During meals in the family's three-room house, he always sat next to his twin sister and best friend: Charity. "We [would] eat from the same plate," he says. And they'd play. She'd kick the soccer ball with him. He'd skip rope with her. "We were so close. It was lovely."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;When the twins became teenagers, Pastor Billy says that a businessman lured Charity away. This businessman promised a more luxurious lifestyle than their family could offer. The twins' father was a cook at the local hospital.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But when Charity returned from spending time with the businessman, she was sick.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"She developed something like a rash — when she pressed [the lesions], water [came out]," remembers Pastor Billy. The rash spread all over her face and arms and soon down to her legs. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71256" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Pastor Billy lost his twin sister, Charity, to HIV/AIDS. After she was diagnosed in 1989, he cared for her at home. She died about two years later. "It brought me to my knees," he remembers.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;At the clinic in Kitwe, she was diagnosed with HIV/AIDS. At the time, in 1989, there were no medications or treatments for AIDS in Zambia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So Billy nursed her at home in their kitchen. Soon, she couldn't walk or even stand. Still today, he can instantly conjure up the image of her skeletal frame and the smell that permeated through the house as her condition deteriorated.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Sometimes if I [was] out, she would be calling for me," he says. "There was one time I stopped going to school, like for a month, because she only wants me to be around."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Two years after her symptoms started, Charity died. "It brought me to my knees," Pastor Billy remembers. "It brought me to a point where [I realized] no matter what I can do as a human being, there is a limit. But at that time of sensing that limitation, I turned to God."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He became a pastor in 1994 as HIV/AIDS pounded the country and region. Until the 1980s, life expectancy had been steadily rising in Zambia. But as the HIV epidemic took off, life expectancy plummeted from 56 to 46 over the course of 15 years, according to &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/aboutunaids/unaidsleadership/bios/mary-mahy" target="_blank"&gt;Mary Mahy of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71251" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;When PEPFAR was founded in 2003, there were &lt;a href="https://press.un.org/en/2003/afr773.doc.htm" target="_blank"&gt;more than 10 million children globally&lt;/a&gt; who had lost one or both parents to AIDS. "When children are deprived of a parent early in life, they have a significantly increased risk of exposure to violence, abuse, neglect, exploitation, school dropout, poverty," explains Hillis. She co-authored a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)00401-5/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;paper in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt; in May&lt;/a&gt; citing research showing that, across 14 countries, children who have lost one or both parents are at six times the risk of contracting HIV.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Part of what drove Bush to incorporate orphans and vulnerable children into PEPFAR was a religious sense of compassion, says &lt;a href="https://www.avenirhealth.org/profile.html?name=Stover" target="_blank"&gt;John Stover&lt;/a&gt;, vice president at Avenir Health, a group that analyzes data and policies for public health programs. "[Bush] had a lot of support from Christian groups — evangelicals and others — who were largely focused on improving the lot of children in Africa," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There was also a practical reason for caring for this group of children, says &lt;a href="https://globalhealth.duke.edu/people/beyrer-chris" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Chris Beyrer&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Duke Global Health Institute. Children who had lost their parents were "perceived to be very vulnerable to groups like militias and extremist organizations and gangs," he explains, pointing out that this was one of the reasons President Bill Clinton declared AIDS a threat to national security.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;"No, no, no, no, no"&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pastor Billy also saw AIDS as a threat. As a new pastor, he saw members of his congregation start falling ill just like Charity had. "They were showing symptoms of my twin sister," he recalls. "I was like, 'No, no, no, no, no.'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The funerals became so frequent that Pastor Billy was sometimes burying people several times a week. Even on Sunday, it would be a quick Mass and, then, to the graveyard. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When services wrapped up, he'd often have another time-sensitive task: figuring out what would happen to the orphaned children. He'd scramble to find relatives and community members to take them in, given the stigma of being associated with an AIDS death. And if nothing else worked, he and his wife would open their home.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"My wife's nursing our first child — [and] she's now a mother of seven," he remembers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"It felt like a miracle"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 1996, far from Zambia, there was an extraordinary turn of events, says Beyrer. Fifteen years after AIDS came on the scene, a very effective treatment was discovered: a combination of drugs that could suppress the virus's replication to extremely low levels.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The results are often described in biblical terms.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"People who are on their deathbeds, wasting away with diarrhea and thrush and fevers, would get on these meds and, literally, rise up off their deathbeds," says Beyrer. "That's what was called the Lazarus effect — like Lazarus raised from the dead." The patients, he says, would "gain weight and go back to school and parenting and working. And it felt like a miracle."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But this was a miracle only for high-income countries. Prior to PEPFAR, the treatment cost so much that it was essentially unavailable for people in sub-Saharan Africa, where the epidemic was the worst. Only when PEPFAR was established did low- and middle-income countries partake in the miracle.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"In Scripture, Jesus said, 'I will not leave you as orphans,'" says Pastor Billy, recalling the passage that captured his relief when, in 2004, PEPFAR arrived in Zambia. "Despair was taken away from families."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71679" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Pastor Billy delivers a sermon in April to his congregants at the Somone Community Centre, a branch of the Pentecostal Holiness Church in Zambia. He remembers that at the height of the AIDS crisis in the 1990s, the funerals became so frequent that he was sometimes burying people several times a week. Even on Sunday, it would be a quick Mass and, then, to the graveyard.

   &lt;p&gt;Hillis remembers a trip to Africa, after PEPFAR was launched, where she realized that the roadside carpenters were no longer displaying caskets for sale — a brisk business when AIDS was at its height. Instead, they were lining the street with handmade beds. "Both of them you lay down in," Hillis remembers thinking to herself. But one, "you lay down to rest because you're going to get up in the morning and live a vibrant life."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As the drugs enabled parents to survive and give birth to children who were not infected with the virus, Pastor Billy focused more fully on the orphans who'd been left behind.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It was in 2016 when he met Diana, just days after she was born. He'd been helping her mother during a rough pregnancy where she was "always sick." And he went to the hospital hoping to celebrate another child born HIV-free to an HIV-positive mother, thanks to modern medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But as Diana's first year unfolded, it became clear that she needed to be tested for HIV. She "was always suffering from diarrhea. She was weak, always underweight," recalls Pastor Billy. He was left wondering whether her mother hadn't taken her HIV medicine as consistently as necessary. He helped get Diana tested for HIV, and then, once the results confirmed his suspicion, he made sure she got on medication to suppress the virus at one of the U.S.-funded clinics in town.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Diana's life stabilized until two devastating family deaths. The girl's mother passed away as she neared her third birthday. Diana moved in with her grandmother — and Pastor Billy and his wife started to help more. For several years, Diana and her grandmother stayed in the pastor's house whenever they walked the 7 miles into town to access the clinic. And in 2021, when Diana's grandmother died, Diana moved in.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"You see pieces of brokenness at different stages in her life," says Pastor Billy. "My heart usually bends toward brokenness."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For a year, Diana grew up among his own children. She often reminded Pastor Billy of his twin sister.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then, in 2022, Pastor Billy and his wife faced a difficult decision. The church asked them to move to a city four hours away. He wanted to take Diana but also felt she would benefit from staying in Kapiri Mposhi, the only place she'd really known. Plus, he had dreams of continuing his religious studies in the U.S. and knew it could be logistically challenging to formally adopt Diana so that she could travel with his family.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So Pastor Billy took the new assignment — but makes a point to visit Diana in her new home regularly. Whenever he does, Diana's face lights up. In that smile, he felt a sense of hope: Diana's generation might be the last one so badly scarred by AIDS, he thought.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Others felt the same. "We've been so close to truly having an AIDS-free generation of kids," says &lt;a href="https://health.mountsinai.org/blog/meet-rachel-vreeman-md-ms-director-of-the-arnhold-institute-for-global-health-at-mount-sinai/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Rachel Vreeman&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the Department of Global Health and Health Systems Design at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. "And that is completely at risk right now."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"There isn't enough food"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In February of this year, Diana had her first hint that something was amiss.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On that 20-minute walk to school, dreams of her future stethoscope were accompanied by pangs of hunger. The monthly packages of food the U.S. had provided for Diana had stopped. And Jennifer Mukuka had lost the stipend she got for transporting medications from Diana's U.S.-funded HIV clinic to far-flung patients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, there's often not enough food in the three-room house they share with Mukuka's adult daughter and two young grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71401" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                Outside Jennifer Mukuka's three-room house, where Diana now lives, Mukuka prepares a lunch of pumpkin leaves and groundnuts. Sometimes, Mukuka says, the family has only enough food to cook one meal a day of beans and a maize porridge called nshima.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"Sometimes we just have one meal per day," explains Mukuka. "In the evening, we just cook porridge."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In a quiet voice and speaking in Bemba, her native language, Diana says, "Because there isn't enough food, I sometimes don't feel well." HIV medication must be taken with food; otherwise it can make the person feel very unwell — one of the reasons PEPFAR usually provided food along with drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's not just food that's in short supply. Her drugs are no longer readily available. Diana's U.S.-funded clinic closed so quickly after the stop-work orders came out in late January that Mukuka couldn't get Diana's medical file or a transfer letter allowing her to restart care at a Zambian government-run clinic. So Mukuka travels to nearby clinics begging for medication to last Diana until they can get the documents she needs to transfer to the government clinic — or until the U.S.-funded clinic reopens, if it does.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The State Department has issued waivers that lifesaving treatment can continue, including treatment and care for HIV. In an emailed statement, the department said that the organizations implementing lifesaving HIV programs "were notified and urged to resume approved service delivery. Agencies have been working with their implementers to resume activities as quickly as possible." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;However, many U.S.-funded clinics have not resumed services yet. Where Diana lives, PEPFAR funding for HIV clinics came via USAID, which has been dismantled by Trump's Department of Government Efficiency. Without USAID, it has been hard for services and programs to resume even if they receive a waiver. Diana's former clinic has not reopened.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Pastor Billy has lost hope that it might open its doors again. "It's closed forever," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We go to different centers, and [we're] just literally scrounging for medication. Sometimes they give us a two-week supply, sometimes a one-week supply," says Mukuka, also speaking in Bemba.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71519" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                "I stress myself [out] thinking about Diana — and me, myself, we are almost the same," says Jennifer Mukuka, who is also HIV-positive and who takes care of Diana. When she couldn't get Diana HIV medications because of the U.S. aid cuts, she shared her own medicine.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;But a handful of times, the scrounging hasn't yielded anything. That means they are sometimes entirely out of Diana's medications. Mukuka says she wakes up in the middle of the night worried about what to do.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I stress myself [out] thinking about Diana — and me, myself, we are almost the same," says Mukuka, who is also HIV-positive. She recalls her nighttime debate about whether she should give Diana her own HIV pills that she gets from a government hospital.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She weighs the dilemma: Diana is young with her whole life ahead of her — she needs the pills. But Diana is also reliant on her, as are her daughter and grandchildren. In the end, she settled on an answer: "Rather than letting her go without medication, I give her my medication," says Mukuka. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That worries Pastor Billy, who says: "God save Diana. That she doesn't develop symptoms because the dosage was too much or was less or it might be wrong."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even then there are crisis points — like the night of Feb. 20, when Pastor Billy learned that Diana was entirely out of medicine. Eventually that night, he found a man one town over from Diana who could help. "He said, 'We can share for five days,'" recalls Pastor Billy, who quickly went to his church to solicit donations for the money needed to transport the medications in a shared taxi from the nearby town to Diana's town.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Diana has, at times, gone a week or two without her medication, Mukuka admits. She knows that when people skip their daily HIV medications, the virus can become drug resistant. "When I couldn't get medication for Diana, I was extremely stressed," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pastor Billy and Mukuka have spent months trying to get Diana's file from the clinic so she can register at the closest government hospital. The Zambian Ministry of Health did not respond to requests for comment about why its medical facilities require past medical files, given the situation. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As they navigate the process, Diana has been taking whatever supply they can get. "Two weeks, one week, two weeks, sometimes even days," says Pastor Billy. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But this past week, he says, he breathed a sigh of relief when he got a phone call announcing that she had been able to get a month's supply of her medication from the district hospital. "She's now getting the medicine, but the consistency is [still] not there," he says, noting that she used to get a six-month supply.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says he feels surrounded by warnings about what might happen. At his church, others are falling ill without their HIV medications. And he has sent Hillis a message about how he's starting to notice that carpenters are displaying caskets again on the roadside.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Kids will go hungry"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the Trump administration has, in the days and weeks following the inaugural proclamations about frozen aid, made a commitment to providing lifesaving treatment like Diana's drugs, the prospect of other support for AIDS orphans — food, clothing, bedding, school fees, counseling — is less promising.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Kids will go hungry. Kids will drop out of school. Kids will be subjected to transactional sex to be able to survive. This is exactly what will happen," says the U.S. civil servant who requested anonymity for fear of retribution. "It's just absolutely atrocious, in my opinion, that we're now bringing back, potentially, another generation of HIV-positive young people, which could have been totally avoided."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Goosby, who used to run PEPFAR, is adamant that the entirety of the program for orphans and vulnerable children should be allowed as part of the waiver for lifesaving aid.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What could be more lifesaving than taking a child, feeding them and educating them?" he says, arguing that interventions that aren't a pill can still be lifesaving.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It really, truly does feel that we are going backward," adds Beyrer of Duke.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71685" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Pastor Billy and Diana share a close bond. When Pastor Billy visits Diana, she lights up with a smile. Here, they share a laugh before she walks to school.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;For Diana and Mukuka, their hope is pinned to small snacks and thin plastic baggies — some filled with about a quarter cup of flour, others with a similar amount of sugar. They use whatever money Pastor Billy can spare to buy the supplies and sell them to neighbors. Each goes for under 20 cents. They hope it will add up to enough money for food and the basics for school — books, notebooks and a uniform. But Mukuka must also feed her daughter and grandchildren — and pay rent.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On a Wednesday in April, Pastor Billy got up early to make the hourslong drive to check on Diana. He caught her before she set off on her walk to school. She lit up, as usual, when she saw him. She calls him "father." They took pictures together, making goofy faces.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then it was time for her to head to school — and for Pastor Billy to drive back home, wondering what to do next. These months of uncertainty, along with the frantic searches for medicine and food, have highlighted the vulnerability of the systems he used to depend on — and also Diana's vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He got into the car thinking that his plans to study religion in the U.S. might need to take a back seat to Diana's needs. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Love is not somebody who visits and takes a picture and puts it on the fridge," he says. Perhaps, he thinks,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;he and his wife should stay in Zambia — and adopt Diana.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-71248" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

Make your bed a tech-free zone &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It might feel cozy to scroll or stream in bed, but Dr. Walker says it's one of the worst things you can do for your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blue light emitted from screens can interfere with the natural sleep-wake cycle, making it &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14722587/Thousands-insomnia-sufferers-missing-groundbreaking-treatment-simply-doctors-dont-know-exist.html"&gt;harder to fall asleep &lt;/a&gt;and affecting the quality of your snooze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This light disrupts your body's production of melatonin, the hormone that makes you sleepy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Quizzed on how much sleep people should get, sleep expert Dr. Matthew Walker (pictured) recommends 7 to 9 hours per night&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it's not just about light. When you use technology under the covers, your bed mentally becomes a place of stimulation rather than relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Walker recently helped design the ultimate bedroom for a peaceful night of sleep, which can be found at the Equinox Hotel in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So concerned about the harms caused by light pollution, he even removed tiny blue lights from the smoke detectors for a complete blackout experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;2. Stick to a schedule, even on weekends&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's the last thing you want to do after a long week, but waking up on weekends at the same time you would for work is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you tend to sleep in on weekends and pull late nights during the week, Dr. Walker says you're throwing your internal clock out of sync. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regimented slumber helps regulate your circadian rhythm so your body knows when to wind down and when to wake up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Your goal: Hit the same bedtime and wake-up time every day. Not only will you fall asleep faster, but you'll wake up feeling more refreshed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;3. Avoid caffeine after lunch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Caffeine lingers in your system long after that pick-me-up - up to 10 hours - so that means you shouldn't even be indulging in that 3 p.m. latte, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study found that it slashed sleep time by 45 minutes, which, Dr. Walker says over time raises the risk of almost every major chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That's why his golden rule is to cut caffeine early. 'The earlier you can limit your intake, the less impact it will have,' he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A good rule of thumb is to cut caffeine intake after noon, which means by 10 p.m., it should have fully cleared from your system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Also in the no-go zone is alcohol before bed. While a glass of wine might make you drowsy, Dr. Walker says it 'certainly shouldn't be used as a sedative.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, regular boozing before bed can make sleep more fragmented and increase the risk of long-term insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;4. Practice a wind-down ritual before bed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Forget doomscrolling or racing through chores until the minute you pass out. Dr. Walker recommends building in a calm, tech-free hour to cue your body for rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Try 'relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation or mindfulness meditation,' he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the hotel rooms he developed, there are meditation and breath-work programs installed on the TVs, which he says have 'an immediate calming effect'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Screens are OK in this case if you're just using them to zen out, he explains. And he recommends practicing these relaxation techniques an hour or more before bed, so that you can then ditch your devices and truly switch off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also recommends a light-dimming routine to mimic the gradual effects of sunset and sunrise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is another design feature he has incorporated into the Equinox hotel rooms, with an automated lighting system designed to put guests to bed and wake them gently in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'In the last hour before bed, set an alarm and turn down half of the lights in your home for two weeks,' he said, recommending a trial period. 'Then go back to full lights on, and ask yourself which you prefer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'If possible, use dimmer switches or lower-wattage lamps for evening lighting.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;5. Get 7 to 9 hours of sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr. Walker, a professor of neuroscience and psychology at the University of California , told the Daily Mail that some of the biggest factors behind peoples' inability to sleep include 'chronic stress, irregular schedules and the rise of tech gadgets'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;None of the aforementioned hacks matter if you're simply not sleeping enough, says Dr. Walker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The magic range is between '7 to 9 hours per night, as supported by robust evidence showing that this range provides maximum benefits for brain health, emotional stability, immune function and physical repair,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Less than six hours? That's when things get dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor says a lack of sleep is 'directly linked to increased risks of cardiovascular disease, metabolic dysfunction and impaired cognitive performance.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Not to mention, it raises stress hormone levels, lowers immunity and can even increase the risk of early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Insomnia isn't just annoying, it's costly. Sleep disorders rack up an estimated $94.9 billion each year in the US, from doctor visits and prescriptions to lost productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But according to Dr. Walker, it doesn't have to be that way - yes, you can get yourself to a place where you can skip the melatonin gummies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Start by reclaiming your bed as a place for only sleep (and sex), and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-italic mol-style-bold"&gt;Dr. Walker has designed the Sleep Experience program at the Equinox Hotel New York.

It’s in gummies, capsules, powders, and teas—promising everything from stress relief and better sleep to more energy and even extra strength at the gym. People love it. It’s been around for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine, so most folks figure it’s safe. And for the most part, it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here's the plot twist no one saw coming: more and more reports are linking ashwagandha to liver problems—some of them pretty serious, and in rare cases, even fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What? Liver damage from Ashwagandha?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it sounds wild, but there’s growing evidence. According to LiverTox (a database run by the NIH), there have been real, documented cases of liver injury linked to ashwagandha. Most people didn’t notice anything until about 2 to 12 weeks after they started taking it. Then—bam—symptoms like yellowing of the skin (jaundice), dark pee, and intense itching showed up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10531359/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;out of India between 2019 and 2022 reported 23 people who developed liver issues after taking just ashwagandha—nothing else. Eight of those were using single-ingredient products. Most of them got better once they stopped taking it, but sadly, three people with pre-existing liver problems died from acute-on-chronic liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So what’s going on?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts aren’t 100% sure why ashwagandha affects the liver in some people, but the current theory points to certain compounds in the herb called withanolides—especially one called withanone. In high doses or over long periods, these may mess with the liver’s detox system, particularly the glutathione system. Basically, it’s like overloading your liver’s cleanup crew until they can't keep up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liver damage tied to ashwagandha isn’t only happening in one place. Reports from Iceland, the U.S., and Europe have all confirmed cases. Some were serious enough to require hospitalization—and at least one person needed a liver transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;European health agencies have flagged at least 22 severe liver injury cases, and that’s likely just scratching the surface. To put it in perspective, herb-related liver damage makes up about 20% of all liver injuries caused by drugs and supplements, and yep—ashwagandha is on that list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is liver toxicity?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, here’s the deal with liver toxicity—it’s basically your liver waving a red flag and saying, “Hey! I’m overwhelmed here!” Your liver is like your body’s detox center. It filters out all the junk—alcohol, meds, processed food chemicals, pollution, even herbal supplements sometimes. But when you overload it with too much of anything, it starts to struggle, and that’s what we call liver toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, this doesn’t mean your liver fails overnight. Liver toxicity can build up slowly and quietly. Some common signs? You might feel super tired all the time, have yellowing skin or eyes (that’s jaundice), stomach pain, dark pee, itchy skin, or even lose your appetite. Sometimes, it’s so sneaky that people don’t notice until something serious shows up in a blood test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What causes it? Well, heavy alcohol use is a classic culprit. But guess what—some over-the-counter painkillers like acetaminophen (paracetamol) can also mess with your liver if taken in high doses. Even “natural” stuff like ashwagandha, kava, or green tea extract in supplement form can trigger toxicity in some people. Your liver doesn’t care if it came from a pharmacy or a plant—if it’s too much, it’s too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news? The liver is a tough organ and can often heal itself if you catch the problem early. Cut down on booze, ditch unnecessary supplements, eat clean, and drink plenty of water. And if you feel “off” for too long, don’t guess—get a liver function test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Should You Freak Out?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily. Millions of people use ashwagandha regularly and never have a problem. Critics of the scare point out that, with over a million U.S. users as of 2020, 23 reported cases is still a pretty tiny risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, it’s a good reminder that "natural" doesn’t always mean "harmless." Like anything else you put in your body, moderation and awareness are key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Here’s What You Can Do&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re using ashwagandha—or thinking about trying it—here’s your game plan:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep your dose reasonable. Most studies use between 150 mg to 600 mg per day. Don’t go overboard just because you think “more = better.” That’s not how herbs work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skip it if you have liver problems. If you’ve had any kind of liver issue in the past, it’s probably best to steer clear, at least until you talk to a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t mix it with everything under the sun. Taking ashwagandha along with other supplements or medications—especially those that affect the liver—can increase the risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen to your body. If you start noticing signs like yellow skin, nausea, dark urine, or weird fatigue, stop taking it and check in with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider getting liver tests. If you’ve been using it long-term or at high doses, it might be worth getting some basic blood work done just to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ashwagandha’s got a lot of reputation for it—lowering stress, improving sleep, boosting mood. But it’s not a magic pill, and recent liver injury cases are a solid reminder that even the most hyped “natural” supplements can come with side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to swear off ashwagandha forever. Just be smart about how you use it. Stick to recommended doses, avoid mixing it with other liver-impacting substances, and stay alert to how your body reacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respect the herb. Use it wisely. And don’t fall into the trap of thinking “herbal” automatically means “risk-free.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jun 2025 05:58:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi_gFBVV95cUxOQWYyTTVrMTBPU0NWdmJ6SFRQbWFfTXZsWnRxSGtmOVVPbjZaTFo5d1ljUjBETl91RHNYTXNXc1NvVjhlOXlpOXBnc19oUGlEdXFIZWJocnZ3aWxBY3l3Sk1BRk9NWDBJM1VSdHhXRHdLaC13akR6TGJzWFljNHdtSHBrYXltU21nWE9XSjBNLXBGTHdJMkZXVE0tZGxtem5WNWFiWU9RSEtnS0Jqb3dmSkVCaFZ1Z2w4RnB4azJ4LW1Va1BXRGxiejUxX2ZHdVQ3bF81RFllMkZoRzhnbUF6WGZhZDZOei16WWlOUHRmaS1ISC1KU05UQXhLNXI2UQ</guid></item><item><title>人工智能“副驾驶”以加快利兹医院的癌症诊断- BBC | AI 'co-pilot' to speed up cancer diagnoses at Leeds hospitals - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1NaUpneGhodENrZFNfaUFwQzN0Z0s1eXJoaEY5b2MxUnZZZEF2bzhYRkljX2pIWUltQTZHVkw1MHhQb2NWbjIwNHNoSzRTMEZDRFBxNm9NUjlyZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE1yVDhNT0NWY3BwdEdna3JjV3NQNF81Rmp4czBzVDdDMGpaOFc3MndkUld3RVh5dk81dUkzSHNuMUVGVUY3TDh5UWxWb2FZeU9VVndmX2tqYWx1eUVEcExN?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 fDtfvH"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 dfvxux"&gt;AI 'co-pilot' used to speed up cancer diagnosis &lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-801dd632-0 eSlECZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-801dd632-12 jSIeFi"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-801dd632-5 kRoBHa"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-801dd632-7 lasLGY"&gt;Emily Doughty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-801dd632-8 hwLppI"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC News, Yorkshire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gyQxwn"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250611-093910-fc500e843d-web-2.23.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/33f1/live/f66ce850-4617-11f0-a359-2d27d079eb0d.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/33f1/live/f66ce850-4617-11f0-a359-2d27d079eb0d.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/33f1/live/f66ce850-4617-11f0-a359-2d27d079eb0d.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/33f1/live/f66ce850-4617-11f0-a359-2d27d079eb0d.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/33f1/live/f66ce850-4617-11f0-a359-2d27d079eb0d.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/33f1/live/f66ce850-4617-11f0-a359-2d27d079eb0d.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/33f1/live/f66ce850-4617-11f0-a359-2d27d079eb0d.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/33f1/live/f66ce850-4617-11f0-a359-2d27d079eb0d.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust Two men are looking at a screen on the left.

That diagnosis belongs to other families, I thought. Not ours.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Fischers met with renowned neurologists and prepared the then-61-year-old to participate in an Alzheimer’s clinical trial for the drug varoglutamstat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then came devastating news that meant Mrs Fischer wouldn't be eligible for the trial - she was suffering from &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-2242332/Cerebrospinal-fluid-leak-Woman-dies-brain-fluid-leak-months-Arizona.html"&gt;a persistent leak of spinal fluid&lt;/a&gt; somewhere in her spinal system, but doctors couldn't pinpoint the source - and couldn't fix it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They believed it was likely a result of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-9266007/New-mum-lie-flat-stop-excruciating-headaches-C-section-caused-brain-leak.html"&gt;epidurals she'd received during childbirth&lt;/a&gt; - an injection in the back that numbs a person from their belly button to their thighs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's a common pain relief option during childbirth and an estimated 61 percent of women who give birth receive an epidural. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After suffering for more than a decade, doctors said a new procedure would allos them to inject &lt;span&gt;dye into Mrs Fischer's spinal fluid to search for the leak - a small spot in the middle of her back. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A few weeks after they sealed it, all of her symptoms went away and doctors said she didn't actually have Alzheimer's - &lt;/span&gt;the tiny spot in her back was actually the source of all her symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sean Fischer's mother, 61, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease after years of worsening memory, severe migraines, balance problems, and nausea. But they had no idea the source of her problems was a fixable spinal fluid leak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Fischer's &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thefp.com/p/sean-fischer-my-moms-alzheimers-diagnosis"&gt;health battle began&lt;/a&gt; long before her Alzheimer's diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It started in spring 2001, when Sean said he received a call from his dad: Mom had pulled over on the highway, vomiting from a sudden, crushing headache. Her doctor called it a migraine, but months later she lost hearing in one ear and was diagnosed with Ménière’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She adjusted — avoiding movements that triggered vertigo, wearing a hearing aid in her forties, and taking daily meds for the headaches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even as she quietly suffered, Sean &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thefp.com/p/sean-fischer-my-moms-alzheimers-diagnosis?utm_source=x&amp;amp;utm_medium=paid-social_&amp;amp;utm_campaign=marketing_evergreen&amp;amp;utm_adgroup=ret&amp;amp;utm_content=alzheimers&amp;amp;utm_adid=1924872245341823240&amp;amp;twclid=275q9y2oonhono4qjy71vk3yuu"&gt;wrote &lt;/a&gt;for The Free Press, she stayed steady for him and his brothers, never missing a soccer game, school musical, or packed lunch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2010, neurologists at Columbia University diagnosed her with a Chiari malformation, a structural defect where the brain is pushed through the opening at the base of the skull. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They suspected the malformation was caused by a cerebrospinal fluid leak, sparked by her three epidurals from the births of each of her sons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Epidurals are extremely safe and are administered by inserting a needle in the space of the lower spine just outside the membrane that surrounds the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It delivers anesthetic medication, which numbs the lower half of the body and blocks pain while allowing the patient to stay awake and alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it can occasionally result in a leak if the needle punctures the thin, tough membrane surrounding the spinal cord containing the CSF, called the dura mater. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An epidural is a safe, widely used method of pain relief during childbirth, delivered by inserting a needle into the epidural space in the lower spine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When this happens, some of the fluid that cushions and protects the brain and spinal cord can leak out into surrounding tissues. It can only be patched up surgically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The leak had, over the years, led to a loss in cerebrospinal fluid volume, causing her brain to sink. This can lead to severe headaches, nausea and vomiting, hearing changes, memory problems, and double vision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I started high school in 2015, and around that time, I began to notice the quiet dislocation of my mom’s mind,’ Sean wrote for &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thefp.com/p/sean-fischer-my-moms-alzheimers-diagnosis"&gt;The Free Press&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sean Fischer wrote about his mother's misdiagnosis of Alzheimer's that was really a constellation of symptoms linked to a leak of cerebrospinal fluid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When we cooked dinner together, she would have trouble following recipes. She’d stare at her calendar for long stretches of time; making sense of it seemed to require more effort than usual. She started to repeat herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘By the time I left for college in Rhode Island, the phrase “You already asked me that” had become a common refrain in the house I grew up in, but at first, we blamed her, telling her she needed to pay more attention.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was seeing doctors for headaches, hearing, and anxiety, none of whom believed there could be a common origin. Her memory problems were worsening as well, which led to Mr and Mrs Fischer to to turn to NYU Langone Health’s Center for Cognitive Neurology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My mom was tested extensively — and two months later came the diagnosis, with the finality of a punctuation mark. Alzheimer’s. When it hit her that there was no cure, my mom was bedridden for three days,’ Sean said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hope came with the study. But then doctors called the Fischers and informed them that the CSF leak would not allow her to participate.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despair took over.&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a few weeks later, Mrs Fischer’s doctor called to tell them about recent medical innovations that would allow surgeons to find and fix the leak, allowing her to participate in the drug trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Six months later, doctors inserted a probe through the femoral artery in Mrs Fischer’s leg, fed it upward toward her spinal system, and sealed the leak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sean said: ‘Two weeks later, I visited home, and found Mom more alert than she had been in years. There was no absent look in her eyes.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After six weeks, her problems with memory were gone entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And eventually, Mom’s neurologist confirmed: She did not have Alzheimer’s.

She would ask the same question multiple times, be bedbound from migraines and unstable on her feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mystery behind her decades-long ailments was seemingly solved when she was diagnosed with &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-d8d8b240-47b8-11f0-a1bc-256a2104db0b"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease in June 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sean said: ‘We had spent countless hours fretting over what could be wrong, but not once did I think it could be early-onset Alzheimer’s. That diagnosis belongs to other families, I thought. Not ours.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Fischers met with renowned neurologists and prepared the then-61-year-old to participate in an Alzheimer’s clinical trial for the drug varoglutamstat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then came devastating news that meant Mrs Fischer wouldn't be eligible for the trial - she was suffering from &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-2242332/Cerebrospinal-fluid-leak-Woman-dies-brain-fluid-leak-months-Arizona.html"&gt;a persistent leak of spinal fluid&lt;/a&gt; somewhere in her spinal system, but doctors couldn't pinpoint the source - and couldn't fix it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They believed it was likely a result of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-9266007/New-mum-lie-flat-stop-excruciating-headaches-C-section-caused-brain-leak.html"&gt;epidurals she'd received during childbirth&lt;/a&gt; - an injection in the back that numbs a person from their belly button to their thighs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's a common pain relief option during childbirth and an estimated 61 percent of women who give birth receive an epidural. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After suffering for more than a decade, doctors said a new procedure would allos them to inject &lt;span&gt;dye into Mrs Fischer's spinal fluid to search for the leak - a small spot in the middle of her back. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A few weeks after they sealed it, all of her symptoms went away and doctors said she didn't actually have Alzheimer's - &lt;/span&gt;the tiny spot in her back was actually the source of all her symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sean Fischer's mother, 61, was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease after years of worsening memory, severe migraines, balance problems, and nausea. But they had no idea the source of her problems was a fixable spinal fluid leak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Fischer's &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thefp.com/p/sean-fischer-my-moms-alzheimers-diagnosis"&gt;health battle began&lt;/a&gt; long before her Alzheimer's diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It started in spring 2001, when Sean said he received a call from his dad: Mom had pulled over on the highway, vomiting from a sudden, crushing headache. Her doctor called it a migraine, but months later she lost hearing in one ear and was diagnosed with Ménière’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She adjusted — avoiding movements that triggered vertigo, wearing a hearing aid in her forties, and taking daily meds for the headaches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even as she quietly suffered, Sean &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thefp.com/p/sean-fischer-my-moms-alzheimers-diagnosis?utm_source=x&amp;amp;utm_medium=paid-social_&amp;amp;utm_campaign=marketing_evergreen&amp;amp;utm_adgroup=ret&amp;amp;utm_content=alzheimers&amp;amp;utm_adid=1924872245341823240&amp;amp;twclid=275q9y2oonhono4qjy71vk3yuu"&gt;wrote &lt;/a&gt;for The Free Press, she stayed steady for him and his brothers, never missing a soccer game, school musical, or packed lunch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2010, neurologists at Columbia University diagnosed her with a Chiari malformation, a structural defect where the brain is pushed through the opening at the base of the skull. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They suspected the malformation was caused by a cerebrospinal fluid leak, sparked by her three epidurals from the births of each of her sons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Epidurals are extremely safe and are administered by inserting a needle in the space of the lower spine just outside the membrane that surrounds the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It delivers anesthetic medication, which numbs the lower half of the body and blocks pain while allowing the patient to stay awake and alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it can occasionally result in a leak if the needle punctures the thin, tough membrane surrounding the spinal cord containing the CSF, called the dura mater. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An epidural is a safe, widely used method of pain relief during childbirth, delivered by inserting a needle into the epidural space in the lower spine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When this happens, some of the fluid that cushions and protects the brain and spinal cord can leak out into surrounding tissues. It can only be patched up surgically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The leak had, over the years, led to a loss in cerebrospinal fluid volume, causing her brain to sink. This can lead to severe headaches, nausea and vomiting, hearing changes, memory problems, and double vision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I started high school in 2015, and around that time, I began to notice the quiet dislocation of my mom’s mind,’ Sean wrote for &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thefp.com/p/sean-fischer-my-moms-alzheimers-diagnosis"&gt;The Free Press&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sean Fischer wrote about his mother's misdiagnosis of Alzheimer's that was really a constellation of symptoms linked to a leak of cerebrospinal fluid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When we cooked dinner together, she would have trouble following recipes. She’d stare at her calendar for long stretches of time; making sense of it seemed to require more effort than usual. She started to repeat herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘By the time I left for college in Rhode Island, the phrase “You already asked me that” had become a common refrain in the house I grew up in, but at first, we blamed her, telling her she needed to pay more attention.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was seeing doctors for headaches, hearing, and anxiety, none of whom believed there could be a common origin. Her memory problems were worsening as well, which led to Mr and Mrs Fischer to to turn to NYU Langone Health’s Center for Cognitive Neurology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My mom was tested extensively — and two months later came the diagnosis, with the finality of a punctuation mark. Alzheimer’s. When it hit her that there was no cure, my mom was bedridden for three days,’ Sean said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Hope came with the study. But then doctors called the Fischers and informed them that the CSF leak would not allow her to participate.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despair took over.&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a few weeks later, Mrs Fischer’s doctor called to tell them about recent medical innovations that would allow surgeons to find and fix the leak, allowing her to participate in the drug trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Six months later, doctors inserted a probe through the femoral artery in Mrs Fischer’s leg, fed it upward toward her spinal system, and sealed the leak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sean said: ‘Two weeks later, I visited home, and found Mom more alert than she had been in years.

&lt;p&gt;When back pain strikes it can be debilitating and most of us will try anything to make it feel better. After a recent bout of horrible lower-back pain (thanks to some overzealous weeding) I found &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/fitness-equipment-tech/i-tried-using-a-massage-gun-for-30-days-and-its-now-an-essential-part-of-my-muscle-recovery" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/fitness-equipment-tech/i-tried-using-a-massage-gun-for-30-days-and-its-now-an-essential-part-of-my-muscle-recovery"&gt;using a massage gun&lt;/a&gt; provided some relief—but I know that to stop this happening again I need to strengthen my back and core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I was surprised to see a PT on Instagram demonstrate how a glute bridge variation could “save” your back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Reel, Alisa from the account Movement By Alisa, can be seen performing a glute bridge with a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=110083&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fyoga-block%2Fb%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D3422271%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dfitandwell-gb-9642923965257928138-20" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.amazon.com/yoga-block/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=3422271" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=110083&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fyoga-block%2Fb%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D3422271%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id="1471" data-merchant-network="Amazonus" data-merchant-url="amazon.com"&gt;yoga block&lt;/a&gt; between her knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like anyone with a bad back, I was hopeful this move could make a big difference, but I decided to double check with an expert first, and spoke to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://relentless-spirit.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://relentless-spirit.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Baltazar Villanueva&lt;/a&gt;, NASM-certified personal trainer with experience in corrective exercise and core stabilization work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good news—Villanueva agrees this move can play a part in building the strength needed to support your back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Squeezing a ball between the knees activates the adductors (inner thighs), which are often underused,” says Villanueva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The adductors and pelvic floor work closely with the deep core muscles so by engaging them, you get more stability through the pelvis and lower back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-9fTCHV48p5y3G29NobhzmU" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-9fTCHV48p5y3G29NobhzmU slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This added stability can reduce compensations in the low back during the movement and help retrain the body to fire the glutes more effectively—both key for reducing strain and pain in the lumbar spine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how should you add this movement to your week?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I typically recommend two or three sets of 10–15 repetitions,” says Villanueva. “focusing on slow, controlled movement and a strong glute squeeze at the top. Quality over quantity is key here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exhale as you lift into the bridge to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/how-to-engage-your-core" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/how-to-engage-your-core"&gt;engage the core&lt;/a&gt; and avoid overarching the back. This is a small move with big impact—but it works best when paired with lifestyle habits like regular movement, hydration and minimizing long periods of sitting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For most people, two to three times per week is a great starting point for exercise, especially if they’re dealing with low back discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may also want to spend some time working on your core strength. “Think of the core as a brace for your spine,” says Villanueva. “When your core is strong—and that includes deep stabilizing muscles like the transverse abdominis—it reduces the load and movement demands on the spine itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This support helps prevent poor posture and protects against the kind of repetitive stress that often leads to chronic back pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good place to start is with these three &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/bodyweight-exercises/all-you-need-is-your-bodyweight-and-these-three-physical-therapist-approved-exercises-to-strengthen-an-injury-prone-lower-back" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/exercise/bodyweight-exercises/all-you-need-is-your-bodyweight-and-these-three-physical-therapist-approved-exercises-to-strengthen-an-injury-prone-lower-back"&gt;bodyweight core exercises&lt;/a&gt; recommended by a physical therapist.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;When outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles occur despite &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/measles-is-one-of-the-deadliest-and-most-contagious-infectious-diseases-and-one-of-the-most-easily-preventable-224493"&gt;highly effective vaccines being available&lt;/a&gt;, it's easy to conclude that parents who don't vaccinate their children are misguided, selfish or have fallen prey to misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As professors with expertise in &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MPOYrOkAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;vaccine policy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://publichealth.gwu.edu/departments/health-policy-and-management/avi-dor"&gt;health economics&lt;/a&gt;, we argue that the decision not to vaccinate isn't simply about &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11050926"&gt;misinformation&lt;/a&gt; or hesitancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our view, it involves &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-theory/"&gt;game theory&lt;/a&gt;, a mathematical framework that helps explain how reasonable people can make choices that collectively lead to outcomes that endanger them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game theory reveals that vaccine hesitancy is not a moral failure, but simply the predictable outcome of a system in which individual and collective incentives aren't properly aligned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Game theory meets vaccines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game theory examines how people make decisions when their outcomes depend on what others choose. In his research on the topic, &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1994/nash/facts/"&gt;Nobel Prize-winning mathematician John Nash&lt;/a&gt;, portrayed in the movie &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Beautiful Mind&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, showed that in many situations, individually rational choices don't automatically create the best outcome for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccination decisions perfectly illustrate this principle. When a parent decides whether to vaccinate their child against measles, for instance, they weigh the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvacx.2023.100268"&gt;small risk of vaccine side effects&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/measles-can-ravage-the-immune-system-and-brain-causing-long-term-damage-a-virologist-explains-252354"&gt;risks posed by the disease&lt;/a&gt;. But here's the crucial insight: The risk of disease depends on what other parents decide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If nearly everyone vaccinates, &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/22599-herd-immunity"&gt;herd immunity&lt;/a&gt; – essentially, vaccinating enough people – will stop the disease's spread. But once herd immunity is achieved, individual parents may decide that not vaccinating is the less risky option for their kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, because of a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.embor.7401134"&gt;fundamental tension&lt;/a&gt; between individual choice and collective welfare, relying solely on individual choice may not achieve public health goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="align-right zoomable"&gt;&lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/672251/original/file-20250604-74-8f08j3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" alt="A public health messaging poster for the polio vaccine featuring an illustration of a bee with red stripes and text promoting the vaccine's benefits" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/672251/original/file-20250604-74-8f08j3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=237&amp;amp;fit=clip" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/672251/original/file-20250604-74-8f08j3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=728&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/672251/original/file-20250604-74-8f08j3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=728&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/672251/original/file-20250604-74-8f08j3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=600&amp;amp;h=728&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/672251/original/file-20250604-74-8f08j3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=914&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/672251/original/file-20250604-74-8f08j3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=30&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=914&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/672251/original/file-20250604-74-8f08j3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=15&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=754&amp;amp;h=914&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;dpr=3 2262w" sizes="(min-width: 1466px) 754px, (max-width: 599px) 100vw, (min-width: 600px) 600px, 237px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A 1963 poster featuring Wellbee, the CDC's national symbol of public health, encouraged people to get the polio vaccine. (&lt;a class="source" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Polio_vaccine_poster.jpg"&gt;CDC via Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes vaccine decisions fundamentally different from most other health decisions. When you decide whether to take medication for high blood pressure, your outcome depends only on your choice. But with vaccines, everyone is connected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This interconnectedness has played out dramatically in &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/05/08/texas-measles-spread-oklahoma-new-mexico/"&gt;Texas, where the largest U.S. measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; in a decade originated. As vaccination rates dropped in certain communities, the disease – once declared eliminated in the U.S. – returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One county's vaccination rate &lt;a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/health/measles-texas-vaccine-vaccination-rates-schools-dfw-fort-worth-dallas/287-1c321c7d-d1ff-4326-ae9b-eec5c9100699"&gt;fell from 96% to 81% over just five years&lt;/a&gt;. Considering that &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2025/what-to-know-about-measles-and-vaccines"&gt;about 95% of people in a community&lt;/a&gt; must be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity, the decline created perfect conditions for the current outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't coincidence; it's game theory playing out in real time. When vaccination rates are high, not vaccinating seems rational for each individual family, but when enough families make this choice, collective protection collapses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The free rider problem&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dynamic creates what economists call a &lt;a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/free-rider/"&gt;free rider problem&lt;/a&gt;. When vaccination rates are high, an individual might benefit from herd immunity without accepting even the minimal vaccine risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989X211053563"&gt;Game theory predicts something surprising&lt;/a&gt;: Even with a hypothetically perfect vaccine – faultless efficacy, zero side effects – voluntary vaccination programs will never achieve 100% coverage. Once coverage is high enough, some rational individuals will always choose to be free riders, benefiting from the herd immunity provided by others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And when rates drop – &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.8952"&gt;as they have, dramatically&lt;/a&gt;, over the past five years – disease models predict exactly what we're seeing: the return of outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game theory reveals another pattern: For highly contagious diseases, vaccination rates tend to decline rapidly following safety concerns, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0403823101"&gt;while recovery occurs much more slowly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This, too, is a mathematical property of the system because decline and recovery have different incentive structures. When safety concerns arise, many parents get worried at the same time and stop vaccinating, causing vaccination rates to drop quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But recovery is slower because it requires both rebuilding trust and overcoming the free rider problem – each parent waits for others to vaccinate first. Small changes in perception can cause &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4161/hv.7.12.17980"&gt;large shifts in behavior&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2021.1949292"&gt;Media coverage, social networks and health messaging&lt;/a&gt; all influence these perceptions, potentially moving communities toward or away from these critical thresholds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mathematics also predicts &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010437"&gt;how people's decisions about vaccination can cluster&lt;/a&gt;. As parents observe others' choices, local norms develop – so the more parents skip the vaccine in a community, the more others are likely to follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game theorists refer to the resulting pockets of low vaccine uptake as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2008.0271"&gt;susceptibility clusters&lt;/a&gt;. These clusters allow diseases to persist even when overall vaccination rates appear adequate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 95% statewide or national average could mean uniform vaccine coverage, which would prevent outbreaks. Alternatively, it could mean some areas with near-100% coverage and others with dangerously low rates that enable local outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154579" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154579" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/VaccinationWearingMasksCovid642.jpg" alt="A masked healthcare worker vaccinating a senior woman " class="wp-image-154579 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/VaccinationWearingMasksCovid642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/VaccinationWearingMasksCovid642-620x415.jpg 620w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/VaccinationWearingMasksCovid642-600x402.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154579" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;About 95% of people in a community must be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity. (Prostock-studio/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Not a moral failure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this means that the dramatic fall in vaccination rates was predicted by game theory – and therefore more a reflection of system vulnerability than of a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10508422.2023.2285750"&gt;moral failure of individuals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, blaming parents for making selfish choices can also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.36959/856/485"&gt;backfire by making them more defensive&lt;/a&gt; and less likely to reconsider their views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much more helpful would be approaches that acknowledge the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4161/hv.19616"&gt;tensions between individual and collective interests&lt;/a&gt; and that work with, rather than against, the mental calculations informing how people make decisions in interconnected systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;People make decisions by balancing individual and collective interests – a calculation that's crucial for how infectious diseases spread.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2021.08.019"&gt;communities experiencing outbreaks respond differently&lt;/a&gt; to messaging that frames vaccination as a community problem versus messaging that implies moral failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2021 study of a community with falling vaccination rates, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03843-2"&gt;approaches that acknowledged parents' genuine concerns&lt;/a&gt; while emphasizing the need for community protection made parents 24% more likely to consider vaccinating, while approaches that emphasized personal responsibility or implied selfishness actually decreased their willingness to consider it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This confirms what game theory predicts: When people feel their decision-making is under moral attack, they often become more entrenched in their positions rather than more open to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Better communication strategies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding how people weigh vaccine risks and benefits points to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2024.2361943"&gt;better approaches to communication&lt;/a&gt;. For example, clearly conveying risks can help: The &lt;a href="https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/pediatrics-articles/measles-is-still-a-very-dangerous-disease"&gt;1-in-500 death rate from measles&lt;/a&gt; far outweighs the extraordinarily rare serious vaccine side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may sound obvious, but it's often missing from public discussion. Also, different communities need different approaches – high-vaccination areas need help staying on track, while low-vaccination areas need trust rebuilt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consistency matters tremendously. Research shows that when health experts &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actpsy.2022.103534"&gt;give conflicting information or change their message&lt;/a&gt;, people become more suspicious and decide to hold off on vaccines. And dramatic &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/why-using-fear-to-promote-covid-19-vaccination-and-mask-wearing-could-backfire-153865"&gt;scare tactics about disease can backfire&lt;/a&gt; by pushing people toward extreme positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making vaccination decisions visible within communities – through community discussions and school-level reporting, where possible – can help &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2024.06.006"&gt;establish positive social norms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When parents understand that vaccination protects vulnerable community members, like infants too young for vaccines or people with medical conditions, it helps bridge the gap between &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/phe/phaa008"&gt;individual and collective interests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health care providers remain the &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-and-trust/poll-finding/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-vaccine-safety-and-trust/"&gt;most trusted source of vaccine information&lt;/a&gt;. When providers understand game theory dynamics, they can address parents' concerns more effectively, recognizing that for most people, hesitancy comes from weighing risks rather than opposing vaccines outright.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/256975/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Now, it's back in the news because two new cases were confirmed in Nevada this week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="fr-embedded"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="e5MYGEcnCT-" data-wc="62"&gt;On June 10, Nevada health officials reported two cases of hantavirus and issued a warning: be extra careful if you’ve been around any signs of rodents. That means places like sheds, barns, trailers, garages, and cabins where deer mice have nested or left droppings. The virus is rare, but when it hits, it can be deadly, as we tragically saw with Betsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="eLh_iv-mhYN" data-wc="70"&gt;“We urge people to be aware of any signs of rodent activity and to take precautions to reduce the risk of exposure to hantavirus,” Melissa Bullock, state medical epidemiologist, said in a press release. “Anyone who has been in contact with rodents, nests, or droppings and subsequently develops symptoms consistent with hantavirus pulmonary syndrome should see a health care provider immediately.” Arizona offered a similar warning back in July 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="fr-embedded"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="eSPY1TC5t3" data-wc="57"&gt;Some of the tips the press release included are airing out enclosed spaces for at least 30 minutes before cleaning, and never sweeping or vacuuming droppings (you’ll just stir up dangerous particles). Instead, spray with disinfectant like a 10% bleach mix, let it sit, then wipe with disposable towels: gloves and an N95 mask are a must. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="eaPOCPN5YH" data-wc="48"&gt;Keep things tidy and food sealed so you’re not inviting mice in the first place, and clear out woodpiles, brush, or anything that could double as a nest. Seal up gaps around doors and windows, and use natural deterrents like vinegar, ammonia, or coffee grounds around the outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;article data-scroll-anchor="true" data-testid="conversation-turn-34" dir="auto"&gt;
 
&lt;/article&gt;&lt;p id="ePesQSicTC4" data-wc="32"&gt;The virus is rare, but it’s serious. Symptoms to look out for are muscle aches, fever, coughing, and tightness in the chest. The CDC stresses that early medical attention can be life-saving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 data-wc="2" id="h3-1iu46i4mbuyqmif"&gt;Betsy's experience&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="fr-embedded"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="eXu1nFicntp" data-wc="38"&gt;Betsy was found dead alongside Hackman in their New Mexico home on February 26. She was 65. While the couple’s deaths were initially reported without much detail, new &lt;a class="hm-link" href="https://www.hola.com/us/celebrities/20250429829314/new-details-gene-hackmans-wife-betsy-autopsy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" data-mrf-recirculation="article-body-link"&gt;autopsy results confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that she died from hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="eTYWUDu9pXTB" data-wc="60"&gt;According to the Associated Press, her lungs were heavy and full of fluid - a classic sign of the virus. She had been dealing with symptoms like fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath in the days before, even reaching out to doctors and researching online about flu-like symptoms. She’d booked an appointment for February 12 - but never showed up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="eueuRUaK0MJi" data-wc="36"&gt;Health inspectors later discovered rodent nests and droppings scattered across their property, including sheds and garages. That’s how hantavirus spreads - through tiny particles in contaminated droppings, urine, or saliva from infected rodents, especially deer mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="fr-embedded"&gt;

A scoop of ice cream or a fistful of chips can soothe more than the soul. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have long noticed the same comfort-seeking reflex in lab animals, hinting that something in the very act of eating can turn down the volume on pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon, known as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3226930/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ingestion analgesia&lt;/a&gt;, crops up even when the “meal” is a single lick of sugar water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that food might blunt discomfort has usually centered on the brain’s reward circuits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet a growing body of work is pulling the spotlight toward the nerves that sit outside the skull. These peripheral messengers, it turns out, don’t just ferry pain – they can hush it, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-enter-trpv1-and-d₂o"&gt;Enter TRPV1 and D₂O&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have discovered a novel way to relieve pain by targeting TRPV1, a key ion channel involved in sensing heat and physical discomfort. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of using conventional painkillers, the approach uses &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_water" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heavy water (D₂O)&lt;/a&gt; to subtly alter the channel’s behavior, effectively reducing its overactivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRPV1 is best known for triggering the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mild-chili-peppers-may-be-the-anti-spice-weve-been-looking-for/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;burning sensation from chili peppers&lt;/a&gt;, but it also plays a central role in many types of pain, with the added benefit of being non-addictive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-comfort-food-s-secret-side-effect"&gt;Comfort food’s secret side effect&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For rodents, a nibble of chocolate during a mild heat test leads to fewer squeaks and squirms. Scientists traced the mellowing effect to hormones that surge as digestion kicks in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief among them is glucagon-like peptide-1, or &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/weight-loss-drugs-unexpectedly-help-people-drink-less-alcohol/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;GLP-1&lt;/a&gt;, a gut signal that rises when nutrients hit the small intestine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In humans, GLP-1 keeps blood sugar in check by nudging the pancreas to release insulin, but its life in the bloodstream is fleeting – barely one or two minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drugmakers have stretched that clock by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/natural-alternative-to-ozempic-glp-1-fgf21-may-soon-be-available-for-humans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;crafting GLP-1&lt;/a&gt; analogs that linger for hours. These longer-lasting versions already help people with type 2 diabetes and, more recently, individuals seeking weight loss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same molecules have been shown to sap pain inside the brain and spinal cord, raising a simple, tantalizing question: could they also soothe pain at the nerve endings scattered through skin, joints, and organs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trpv1-channel-the-gatekeeper"&gt;TRPV1 channel – the gatekeeper&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fresh experiments suggest the answer is yes. GLP-1 appears to shoulder past a notorious gatekeeper of pain, the TRPV1 channel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of TRPV1 as a molecular thermostat: when capsaicin from a pepper, a hot stove, or acidic conditions switches it on, ions rush through its pore, igniting a pain signal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/patients-with-chronic-pain-are-turning-to-cannabis-for-relief/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;chronic pain disorders&lt;/a&gt;, the channel can become hypersensitive, turning even a light touch into agony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/12180212/TRPV1_water-permeability_drug-free-pain-relief_credit-NBE_1m.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/12180219/TRPV1_water-permeability_drug-free-pain-relief_credit-NBE_1s.webp" alt="Tracking the water permeability of TRPV1 using up-conversion nanoprobes in single live cells.

Click image to enlarge. Credit: Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Directly blocking TRPV1 has helped in animal tests, but the strategy often wreaks havoc with body temperature, leaving patients flushed or chilled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLP-1 seems to take a subtler route. Instead of wedging the channel shut, it tweaks TRPV1 just enough to stop the excess firing while sparing the body’s heat control. The result is a calmer signal with no feverish side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cooling-down-a-hot-channel"&gt;Cooling down a hot channel&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details of that tweak came into sharper focus thanks to a collaboration that stretched from Singapore to Beijing. Professor Liu Xiaogang of the &lt;a href="https://nus.edu.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;National University of Singapore&lt;/a&gt; and colleagues had pivoted from hormones to water – specifically, heavy water, or D₂O. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their team fashioned a luminescent nanoprobe able to tell ordinary H₂O from its heftier cousin as the molecules darted through single TRPV1 pores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When D₂O slipped through the channel, pain signals in nerve cells sputtered. In living models of both acute and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/people-with-chronic-pain-have-high-rates-of-depression-and-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;chronic inflammatory pain&lt;/a&gt;, injections of D₂O eased sensitivity without muting other nerve reflexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-trpv1-pain-management-strategy"&gt;TRPV1 pain management strategy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery deepens our understanding of TRPV1 function and lays the groundwork for new pain-management strategies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team now plans to investigate how D₂O influences additional ion channels, aiming to adapt this mechanism for treating neurological disorders and other clinical challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solvent-mediated pathway to analgesia stands out as a major advance in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/chronic-pain-is-harder-to-treat-in-women-but-a-new-target-offers-hope/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;pain therapy&lt;/a&gt; and could usher in safer, non-addictive options for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although calming an overactive channel with solvent molecules may sound unconventional, D₂O is already well known in nuclear reactors and biochemical laboratories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In small doses it poses little risk, making it an appealing complement – rather than a replacement – to existing drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-happens-next"&gt;What happens next?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pair GLP-1 analogs with the solvent trick and a two-pronged strategy emerges: tamp down abnormal TRPV1 activity while letting the body keep its natural thermostat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That approach could offer relief to millions who live with neuropathic pain, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/oregano-herb-helps-reduce-and-prevent-joint-pain-from-arthritis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;osteoarthritis&lt;/a&gt;, or lingering post-surgical aches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are all conditions where current options rely heavily on opioids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, both of which are carry-overs from the last century and are not without drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical translation will demand careful dosing studies, long-term safety checks, and creative formulations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the blueprint is simple: use a compound we already make after every meal, fortify it so it sticks around, and harness its knack for silencing wayward pain channels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add a dash of heavy water for extra finesse, and the humble act of eating might inspire the next generation of pain relief – no prescription for comfort food required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-024-01288-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?

&lt;p&gt;Byrne said it’s important to know the official definition of binge drinking. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/binge-drinking.htm" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888383" data-affiliate="true"&gt;The CDC says&lt;/a&gt; having five drinks or more on an occasion for men and four drinks or more for women is considered binge drinking. “I think it’s less than a lot of people think,” Byrne noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about it: If you’ve ever been to a wedding where there’s cocktail hour, dinner, dancing and often an after-party, you know how easy it is to have four or five drinks during the celebration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What you do with alcohol is completely up to you, and just because you drink more than what’s considered binge drinking on a single occasion doesn’t necessarily mean you have an alcohol addiction or an alcohol problem,” Byrne said. “I want to make that clear, too, but technically speaking, that is the definition of binge drinking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Pay close attention to &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you’re drinking.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who do choose to drink, Brooks said it’s important to pay attention to three things: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The frequency and quantity of your drinking: Use the CDC’s guidelines to assess how much and how often you’re drinking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why you’re drinking: “Ask yourself, what is it that I think this drink will do for me?” Brooks said, adding that if you’re using alcohol to de-stress, let loose or be more social, know that you can do this without drinking. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is there something else you can do or drink instead of alcohol? “Because there are actually so many ways that we can achieve those benefits that people think they’re getting from drinking, we can get all of those things without drinking,” Brooks said.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you are saying, ‘Well, I just need this drink because I just need to relax’ ... that alcohol itself isn’t actually what helps you relax. [What can give you that effect can] be the sitting, taking a break from what you’re doing or going to happy hour and talking to people, connecting to people, getting a change of scenery,” Brooks explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can still relax without a glass of wine. You could take up coloring or take a bath with a seltzer by your side instead of a glass of wine, or you could go out for a walk for an after-work change of scenery, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If somebody believes that having that drink at the end of the day is their way to relax, then just by default they’re not thinking about other ways that they actually could decompress,” Brooks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond thinking about your intention with alcohol, it’s important to look at any red flags, too. “If you think your drinking might be problematic, ask yourself why you’re doing it,” Byrne said, “and if you’re doing it to avoid certain feelings or numb certain feelings, then that’s something to question and probably a reason to reassess your relationship with alcohol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, it’s also a good idea to reach out to a therapist who’s trained in substance use treatment who can support you, Byrne added. The &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7888383" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Psychology Today website&lt;/a&gt; can help you find a local mental health provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Brooks noted that changing your drinking habits is not an easy feat. If you are trying to do this, it’s a good idea to lean on loved ones who have a similar mindset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Need help with substance use disorder or mental health issues?

The finding suggests that environmental chemicals in the gut may fuel immune responses tied to mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They set out to discover how one gut bacterium might play an active role in major depressive disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Harvard and the Broad Institute focused on &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27421818/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Morganella morganii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a gut bacterium previously &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00991-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to depression, type 2 diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their aim was to pinpoint a specific molecule that connects the bacterium to inflammation and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/teens-with-problematic-smartphone-use-suffer-from-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/bioassay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;bioassay&lt;/a&gt; approach, they discovered unusual &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/phospholipid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;phospholipids&lt;/a&gt; made by &lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt;. These lipids mimic cardiolipins but include an environmental contaminant, diethanolamine (DEA), instead of the usual glycerol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-contaminant-triggers-inflammation"&gt;Contaminant triggers inflammation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt; adds a chemical called DEA to its fats (lipids), it changes the molecule in a way that triggers the body’s immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tests showed that this new molecule turns on special sensors in immune cells called &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2014.00461/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;TLR1 and TLR2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once these sensors are activated, the immune cells release a substance called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4176007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;interleukin-6 (IL-6)&lt;/a&gt;. IL-6 causes inflammation and has been &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7139933/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to depression in genetic studies, suggesting it plays a role in mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a story out there linking the gut microbiome with depression, and this study takes it one step further, toward a real understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the link,” said senior author Jon Clardy, the Christopher T. Walsh, PhD Professor of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology in the &lt;a href="https://hms.harvard.edu/research/blavatnik-institute" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Blavatnik Institute&lt;/a&gt; at HMS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-immune-system-and-bacterial-lipids"&gt;Immune system and bacterial lipids&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that special lipids from &lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt; – called MmDEACLs – can kickstart the immune system by attaching to two receptors, TLR1 and TLR2, which are known for spotting bacterial molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This set off the release of interleukin-6 (IL-6), a signaling protein linked to long-term inflammation and immune-related illnesses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here’s the twist: only the versions of these lipids that contained DEA caused a strong IL-6 response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that small changes in the shape of the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/fatty-acids" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;fatty acid chains&lt;/a&gt; – like having a double bond instead of a ring – made a big difference in how strongly the immune system reacted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shows that our immune system can pick up on very fine molecular details in bacterial chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-matters"&gt;Why this matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery offers strong molecular evidence that gut bacteria altered by environmental pollutants can influence immune pathways tied to depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It suggests &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/people-with-depression-often-hold-tightly-to-self-doubt/"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; may have an autoimmune or inflammatory component in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also raises the possibility that DEA‑modified lipids could serve as biomarkers, helping to identify individuals whose depression may stem from this mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We knew that micropollutants can be incorporated into fatty molecules in the body, but we didn’t know how this occurs or what happens next,” Clardy said. “DEA’s metabolism into an immune signal was completely unexpected.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chronic-gut-inflammation-and-depression"&gt;Chronic gut inflammation and depression&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term exposure to&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5805548/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; inflammatory signals&lt;/a&gt; like IL-6 has been repeatedly linked to the development of depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elevated IL-6 levels are often found in people with major depressive disorder and can disrupt normal brain signaling, especially in mood-related areas like the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This supports the idea that &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493173/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, sparked by environmental contaminants processed by &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3983973/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, could act as a biological trigger for depression in some individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than being purely psychological, these cases might respond better to treatments that target the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work follows earlier &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8001875/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;findings&lt;/a&gt; where individual gut bacteria and their molecules were tied to inflammation, immune modulation, and disease outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also strengthens the gut‑immune‑brain concept by adding a contaminant‑mediated chemical twist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-environment-and-mental-health"&gt;Environment and mental health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The role of diethanolamine (&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/cosmetics/cosmetic-ingredients/diethanolamine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DEA&lt;/a&gt;) in this study highlights the broader impact of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11352651/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;environmental micropollutants&lt;/a&gt; on human biology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEA is widely used in industrial processes and personal care products, and its presence in the environment means exposure is nearly unavoidable for most people in developed countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a common bacterium like &lt;em&gt;M. morganii&lt;/em&gt; transforms DEA into an immune-stimulating molecule, it creates a new layer of interaction between pollution, the microbiome, and the immune system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This connection raises public health concerns about how chemical exposures might shape disease risks in ways not previously considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-treating-depression-in-the-gut"&gt;Treating depression in the gut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers note that while the mechanism is clear, further work is needed to determine how often this occurs in depressed individuals and whether blocking this pathway alleviates symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They plan to explore whether other gut microbes use similar chemical substitutions and what portion of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-too-much-salt-may-contribute-to-depression/"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; cases might involve this contaminant‑inflammation route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now that we know what we’re looking for, I think we can start surveying other bacteria to see whether they do similar chemistry and begin to find other examples of how metabolites can affect us,” said Clardy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By revealing how a gut bacterium turns a common contaminant into a pro‑inflammatory agent, the study offers new insight into the complex makeup of mental health disorders, and hints at novel ways to detect and treat them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/194993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sunghee Bang&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Heart disease and type 2 diabetes affect millions of people across the United States every year.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While many of us are aware of common lifestyle changes to help reduce the risks, like staying active, maintaining a healthy weight and getting enough sleep, what we eat plays a major role too. A &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/plant-based-protein-benefits-11712145" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diet rich in plant-based foods&lt;/a&gt;, like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes, may do wonders for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-for-gut-and-heart-health-8771784" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;supporting heart health&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290068/12-healthy-ways-to-lower-your-blood-sugar/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;managing blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;But there’s one lesser-known piece of the puzzle that’s worth exploring further: phytosterols.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Phytosterols, sometimes called plant sterols, are naturally occurring compounds found in plants. What makes phytosterols special is their ability to block cholesterol absorption in the digestive system, which may help lower LDL (the "bad" cholesterol) levels. And new data shared at the American Society for Nutrition meeting in Orlando highlighted the potential impact consuming phytosterols may have on aspects of our overall health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To conduct this study, researchers gathered and analyzed data from three large cohorts involving over 200,000 adults in the United States. The participants, who were nurses and other health professionals, provided health and dietary information over a follow-up period of up to 36 years. By using food-frequency questionnaires, the researchers estimated the participants’ intake of total phytosterols and three specific types (β-sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol). Participants were then categorized into quintiles based on their phytosterol intake, with the highest quintile representing the most plant-forward diets.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beyond dietary data, the researchers collected biological samples from participants to analyze metabolic biomarkers and other health indicators. Blood samples from over 11,000 participants were examined to identify metabolites and markers related to insulin regulation, inflammation, and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-you-have-metabolic-syndrome-8694742" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;. Additional blood samples from more than 40,000 participants were analyzed to detect specific biomarkers linked to heart disease and type 2 diabetes. These biomarkers offered insights into potential mechanisms through which phytosterols might influence disease risk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To explore a potential link between phytosterol intake and gut health, the study also investigated the microbiome composition of a subset of 465 participants. Advanced genetic sequencing techniques were used to identify specific microbial species and enzymes present in these individuals' gut microbiomes. The goal was to examine whether certain microbes altered the metabolism of phytosterols in ways that contributed to lower disease risk. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did The Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The results of this study showed that those who consumed higher amounts of phytosterols experienced impressive health benefits. Participants in the top quintile of phytosterol intake had a 9% lower likelihood of developing heart disease and an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lignans-may-reduce-risk-of-diabetes-according-to-study-8696870" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;8% lower risk of type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; when compared to those in the bottom quintile. These findings suggest that even within the range of normal dietary intake, phytosterols may make a meaningful difference in reducing the risk of these chronic diseases.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Further analysis revealed that participants who consumed higher levels of total phytosterols and β-sitosterol had favorable changes in their metabolic markers. The researchers found evidence linking higher phytosterol intake to improved insulin regulation, lower levels of inflammation, and the presence of healthier metabolites. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, when it comes to gut health and phytosterol consumption, researchers identified microbial species and enzymes in the gut microbiome that were associated with higher phytosterol intake. For example, species like &lt;em&gt;Faecalibacterium prausnitzii&lt;/em&gt; were linked to the degradation of phytosterols, potentially influencing the production of beneficial metabolites. This suggests that a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; might amplify the positive effects of phytosterols, per the researchers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While this study offers valuable insights, it’s important to note a few limitations. Since it’s an observational study, it can only suggest a link between phytosterol intake and a lower risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes, rather than proving a direct cause-and-effect relationship. Most of the participants were health professionals, which means the results might not fully reflect the broader population. Additionally, the dietary information was self-reported through food-frequency questionnaires, which could include some errors or misremembered details. The study also found connections between phytosterol intake, microbiome changes and metabolic markers, but we still need more research to understand how these connections work. Lastly, the long follow-up period was helpful for tracking outcomes, but changes in diet and lifestyle over time, which weren’t entirely accounted for, could have played a role in the findings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Also, these results are not published in a peer-reviewed journal, which means they should be interpreted with caution until further scrutiny validates the findings. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you are focused on taking steps toward reducing the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes, based on these findings, incorporating phytosterol-rich foods into your meals may have a profound impact. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re curious about where to start, here’s a list of phytosterol-rich foods you can consider adding to your diet:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Nuts (such as almonds, pistachios and walnuts)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seeds (like sunflower seeds and flaxseeds)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Legumes (including lentils and chickpeas)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fruits (such as oranges, apples and avocados)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vegetables (like broccoli, Brussels sprouts and carrots)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole grains (such as oats, quinoa and barley)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vegetable oils (canola, sunflower and olive oil)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By including these foods in your daily meals, you might enjoy the added benefit of lowering LDL cholesterol levels and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-improve-metabolic-syndrome-8742510" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supporting metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;. Something as simple as sprinkling seeds over your salad, choosing whole-grain bread, or swapping out snacks for a handful of nuts can make a big difference over time. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This new study presented at an American Society for Nutrition meeting highlights the compelling potential of phytosterols in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/eating-more-protein-may-reduce-heart-disease-risk-8422551" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;promoting better heart and metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;. Across the three large cohorts studied, higher phytosterol intake was associated with a 9% lower risk of heart disease and an 8% lower risk of type 2 diabetes, which is especially significant given the prevalence of these conditions in the United States. The findings also revealed that individuals with diets rich in phytosterols saw &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-reduce-insulin-resistance-for-better-blood-sugar-8750433" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;improvements in insulin regulation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-top-nutrients-to-fight-inflammation-8675325" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;reduced inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, pointing to their role in fostering overall metabolic balance.

In the U.S., an &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/getmedia/ef8f48f9-ad36-48ea-87f9-b74034635c1e/alzheimers-facts-and-figures.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.alz.org/getmedia/ef8f48f9-ad36-48ea-87f9-b74034635c1e/alzheimers-facts-and-figures.pdf" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;estimated 7.2 million Americans ages 65 and older&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are living with Alzheimer's dementia in 2025. The percentage of affected people increases with age: About 5% of people ages 65 to 74 have Alzheimer's, compared with more than 33% of people ages 85 and older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the point when a doctor has verified that a patient has cognitive decline, the blood test can be used in place of standard tests to see if they likely have Alzheimer's. Previously, gold-standard methods of diagnosing Alzheimer's have been more invasive and expensive, involving positron emission tomography (PET) scans, which use radioactive substances; and lumbar punctures, (also called spinal taps) during which a clinician uses a needle to sample spinal fluid from the low back. Clinicians also sometimes use &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/in-depth/alzheimers/art-20048075" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/in-depth/alzheimers/art-20048075" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;MRIs or CT scans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to rule out other causes of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new test measures the ratio of two proteins in human blood, and this ratio correlates with the presence or absence of amyloid plaques, a primary sign of Alzheimer's found in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people experiencing memory lapses that might be due to Alzheimer's, the first step is to see their primary care physician (PCP), who should do a cognitive test. If there are signs of cognitive impairment, the patient would then be referred to a neurologist for an in-depth evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both dementia specialists and PCPs will be able to order this blood test to help with diagnosis, said &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/day-gregg-s-m-d/bio-20478797" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/day-gregg-s-m-d/bio-20478797" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Gregg Day&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist with the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida; Day led a study of the blood test published in June in the &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70316" target="_blank" data-url="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70316" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Journal of the Alzheimer's Association&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

Researchers analyzed data from over 15,000 U.S. adults, comparing their mental health surveys with saliva samples to assess microbial diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings show that people with less diverse oral microbiomes were more likely to experience depression, even after accounting for factors like smoking and dental care. While the direction of this link is still unclear, the study suggests the oral microbiome may one day be used to help diagnose or treat mood disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microbial Diversity Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; People with lower oral microbiome diversity showed more depressive symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle Factors Influence Microbes:&lt;/strong&gt; Smoking, drinking, and dental care affected the depression-microbiome link.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnostic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; With further research, oral bacteria could serve as biomarkers for depression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;NYU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A rich and varied mix of microbes in the mouth, particularly bacteria, is not only important for our oral health, but may hold clues for other conditions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study led by researchers at NYU Rory Meyers College of Nursing finds that a lower diversity of microbes in the mouth is associated with depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mouth is home to between 500 billion and 1 trillion bacteria—the second-largest community of microorganisms in our bodies, after the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing number of studies point to the connection between the oral microbiome and our overall health, from diabetes to dementia, a relationship thought to be driven by inflammation and disruptions to the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study in mice found a potential link between depression and the diversity of bacteria in the gut, but less is known about the connection between the oral microbiome and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having a better understanding of the relationship between the oral microbiome and depression could not only help us learn about the mechanisms underlying depression, but could contribute to the development of new biomarkers or treatments for mood disorders,” said Bei Wu, vice dean for research at NYU Rory Meyers College of Nursing and the senior author of the study, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;BMC Oral Health&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore the connection between the oral microbiome and depression, the researchers examined survey and biological data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using data from more than 15,000 US adults ages 18 and older collected between 2009 and 2012, the researchers compared questionnaires measuring symptoms of depression with saliva samples. Gene sequencing was used to identify the microbes in the saliva and measure the diversity of the oral microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that people with less diversity in their oral microbiomes were more likely to have symptoms of depression. Additional analyses showed that smoking, drinking, and dental care—all of which can change the makeup of bacteria in the mouth—influenced the relationship between the oral microbiome and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that, with more research, the oral microbiome could potentially be used to diagnose or treat depression. However, based on this study, it’s not clear whether the diversity of microbes in the mouth influences depression or if depression leads to changes in the oral microbiome—or if there’s a bidirectional relationship between the two.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s possible that the oral microbiome influences depressive symptoms through inflammation or changes to the immune system. Conversely, depression can drive changes including dietary intake, poor oral hygiene, increased smoking and drinking, or the use of medications—all of which have the potential to alter the oral microbiome,” said Wu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need more research to understand the direction and underlying pathways of this relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work is part of a broader effort to understand how the oral microbiome influences not only mental health, but also cognitive decline and the onset of dementia,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional study authors include Xichenhui Qiu, Ting Xu, Yiqing Huang, Changning Wei, and Lina Wang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this microbiome and depression research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#83f1e2e0ebe6efadebe2f1f1eaf0ecedc3edfaf6ade6e7f6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Rachel Harrison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nyu.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;NYU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Rachel Harrison – NYU&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12903-025-06274-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Relationship between depression and oral microbiome diversity: analysis of NHANES data (2009–2012)&lt;/a&gt;” by Bei Wu et al. &lt;em&gt;BMC Oral Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relationship between depression and oral microbiome diversity: analysis of NHANES data (2009–2012)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the association between the gut microbiome and depression is well studied, the association between the oral microbiome and depression is less well characterized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cross-sectional study analyzed the association between depression and diversity of oral microbiome using data from the 2009–2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The gene sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA was adopted for the profiling of oral microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alpha diversity, quantified by the observed number of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), and beta diversity, assessed using Bray–Curtis dissimilarity, were evaluated to represent oral microbiome diversity. Depressive symptoms were measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scale, with alpha diversity as the primary predictor. Weighted logistic regression was employed to examine the relationship between depression and microbial alpha diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Threshold effect analysis was performed to explore potential nonlinear relationships between the observed ASVs and depression. Subgroup analysis indicated that smoke, excessive alcohol consumption, and oral treatment influenced the association between oral microbiology and depression, with interaction effects observed across gender and racial groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beta diversity differences were evaluated using Bray–Curtis dissimilarity and visualized via non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 15,018 participants were included, with an average age of 42.25 ± 15.2 years. In the fully adjusted model, the alpha diversity of oral microbiome was significantly negatively correlated with depression (OR = -0.51, 95% CI: -0.79—-0.23, &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.003). Threshold analysis also revealed a nonlinear association in this relationship, with a significant inflection point as Log10ASVs of 2.32.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, beta diversity of the oral microbiome differed significantly between the normal and depression groups (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001). Sensitivity analyses showed that the relationship between depression and oral microbial diversity observed in this research was particularly pronounced among non-Hispanic Whites (OR = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.07–0.35) and men (OR = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.06–0.30). Additionally, significant differences in oral microbiome beta diversity were observed between the normal and depression groups (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that the diversity of oral microbiome is negatively correlated with depressive symptoms. Hence, oral dysbiosis may serve as a therapeutic target or biomarker of depression. However, the underlying mechanisms require further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 21:56:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFAtVUhMOEQyd1p6Mmc1SVRBQkFNbTRLRW50V0pxS0VkMVFXSzFpS05XTWFneG9XSkF0ZGtIOURyTjREdThTeHBVS0RKTEc2SFd5WTAxTmc0M0YzVVRTSEt1Vm8tSjNPekFKa2loVENodw</guid></item><item><title>水果和蔬菜中的天然化合物可降低心脏病和糖尿病风险- SciTechDaily | Natural Compound in Fruit and Vegetables Found To Slash Heart Disease and Diabetes Risk - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxNaF85RWpnVndfWWx2RzJickNIOUNvazB1QndNcDRJdVpmMml2VWl2d19FZ1hHS2EtRk1fM1JKajNqXzg3UENOc3pZUUczcVB1N3h4VnNyRWtyTTdJbHlUcGRpSm9nNUJDMWZ6RTFLZHYtVWY0UHdGN0tRTzlXY3h0bDZ6WFpEMHVmY3VjYTJfdkU5dkNUbWFnakdvb3d4Vy03VFN3NThMX2ZPcFhVeUFsU0tnSQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 21:49:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNaF85RWpnVndfWWx2RzJickNIOUNvazB1QndNcDRJdVpmMml2VWl2d19FZ1hHS2EtRk1fM1JKajNqXzg3UENOc3pZUUczcVB1N3h4VnNyRWtyTTdJbHlUcGRpSm9nNUJDMWZ6RTFLZHYtVWY0UHdGN0tRTzlXY3h0bDZ6WFpEMHVmY3VjYTJfdkU5dkNUbWFnakdvb3d4Vy03VFN3NThMX2ZPcFhVeUFsU0tnSQ</guid></item><item><title>可以“从内到外吃掉你”的致命真菌现在在美国，并迅速蔓延到世界各地- Earth.com | Deadly fungus that can 'eat you from the inside out' is now in the U.S. and quickly spreading around the world - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixwFBVV95cUxQOUEwX2NZUWdFeFJ5SWRnLUNtRzMxT2V5YW05VERMR05lbmdsajM4ZWRLYnYtTkpDdGI4T24yTE12dUk5cENYSXlIOV9ONGV4ODF2dks3NWdOVFlCTGozOC1UamxTdkRtLWdLaUdrME85am9YaXBPNll0WkF0NkhTZ25pbVY0WjFyQ09XdnpFMW9oUmF5dWdKZWFwSHNTYjNjT25TNjJyc015RHhzRzhVSGV2MHBnZmwwNGhfcWJtSjBzbE9nOEVF?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine inhaling hundreds of invisible spores every day. Most float in and out without leaving a trace. Yet some belong molds that don’t respect boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some fungus species will infect lungs, spoil crops, and disrupt ecosystems all at the same time. In short, they can wreak massive havoc and leave death in their wake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most molds and fungi are helpful, but some fungus and mold will jump from hospital wards to honeybee hives, and the line between helpful recycler and harmful invader grows blurrier each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the time, healthy immune systems swat away dangerous spores and fight off infection. Trouble arises when weakened defenses, rising temperatures, and heavy fungicide use tip the scales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the same fungus that quietly decomposes the fallen leaves in your yard can trigger relentless coughs, damage corn silos, and shrug off medicines that once kept it in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aspergillus-fungus-easily-adapts"&gt;Aspergillus fungus easily adapts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After studying fungal threats for years, Dr. Norman van Rhijn and colleagues at &lt;a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The University of Manchester&lt;/a&gt; mapped how three notorious Aspergillus species – &lt;em&gt;A. flavus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;A. fumigatus&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;A. niger&lt;/em&gt; – might spread through the end of the century. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They fed climate change scenarios into global models and watched the virtual spores drift. One scenario (SSP585), which assumes a fossil-fuel-dependent future, paints an unsettling picture: habitats across Europe become markedly friendlier to these pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspergillus fungus thrives because its genome bends easily to new pressures. It lives on soil, grains, animal feathers, even coral skeletons. Out in the wild, it recycles nutrients, but on farms and in clinics, the story shifts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farmers spray &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/super-fungus-is-among-us-drug-resistant-fungi-is-thriving-in-every-corner-of-the-earth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;azole fungicides&lt;/a&gt; to protect wheat and peanuts; doctors use nearly identical azole drugs to save patients with lung infections. That overlap nudges Aspergillus toward drug resistance – similar to bacteria evolving against &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/earth-rivers-are-highly-saturated-with-human-antibiotics-helping-bacteria-develop-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-climate-reshapes-global-mold-map"&gt;Climate reshapes global mold map&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Temperature, humidity, and extreme weather events dictate where spores settle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Changes in environmental factors, such as humidity and extreme weather events, will change habitats and drive fungal adaptation and spread,” said Dr. van Rhijn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve already seen the emergence of the fungus &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/toxic-microbes-aerosols-can-travel-thousands-of-miles-through-the-air/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Candida auris&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; due to rising temperatures, but, until now, we had little information on how other fungi might respond to this change in the environment.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that fungi remain “relatively under-researched compared to viruses and parasites,” yet the new maps show they will likely reach “most areas of the world in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/12133204/Aspergillus_global-distributions_map_credit-MaxENT_1m.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/12133212/Aspergillus_global-distributions_map_credit-MaxENT_1s.webp" alt="MaxENT model accurate described Aspergillus global distributions.

Click image to enlarge. Credit: University of Manchester&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those maps point to striking numbers. Under the high-emissions pathway, the range of &lt;em&gt;A. flavus&lt;/em&gt; in Europe could jump about 16 percent, potentially putting another one million people at risk of infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A. fumigatus&lt;/em&gt; – the chief culprit behind invasive aspergillosis – could expand its European footprint by 77.5 percent, threatening up to nine million more residents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Africa, paradoxically, parts of the continent may become too hot for some fungi to survive, hinting at complex regional trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-forecasting-aspergillus-fungus-spread"&gt;Forecasting Aspergillus fungus spread&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forecasting pathogens decades ahead may sound speculative, but it builds on earlier warnings. Hospitals already grapple with Aspergillus fungus outbreaks after building renovations or severe dust storms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, intensive-care units report stubborn cases in patients recovering from influenza or COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rising outdoor spore loads could translate to more &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-do-deadly-molds-attack-the-immune-system-of-humans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;hospital admissions&lt;/a&gt; and costlier treatments, especially because diagnostics for fungal infections lag far behind those for bacteria or viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mycotoxin contamination adds another layer. A single year of heavy Aspergillus growth can saddle the U.S. corn industry with losses topping $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased heat and humidity extend the window for mold growth in silos and fields, forcing farmers to discard grain or blend batches to dilute toxins – strategies that still carry economic and health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-current-drugs-don-t-work"&gt;Current drugs don’t work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azole resistance has climbed steadily in Europe and Asia. Patients with resistant Aspergillus fungus infections face mortality rates exceeding 50 percent, partly because alternative drugs can damage the kidneys or liver. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each hectare treated with agricultural azoles raises the odds that environmental spores will carry resistance genes into hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public-health agencies now track these genes in soil and compost piles, hoping to spot trouble before it reaches intensive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fungicide demand is also changing. As some African regions exceed the thermal limits for certain molds, farmers elsewhere may spray more to protect lengthening growing seasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That feedback loop – more fungicide, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/soil-plays-an-overlooked-role-in-antibiotic-resistance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stronger resistance&lt;/a&gt; – complicates food security and patient care alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-farms-food-and-rising-bills"&gt;Farms, food, and rising bills&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspergillus isn’t the lone shapeshifter. &lt;em&gt;Fusarium&lt;/em&gt;, which devastates wheat and oat fields, and &lt;em&gt;Cryptococcus&lt;/em&gt;, an opportunistic pathogen in AIDS patients, also respond to warming climates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fungal pathogens pose a serious threat to human health by causing infections and disrupting food systems. Climate change will make these risks worse,” explains Viv Goosens of &lt;a href="https://wellcome.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Wellcome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“To address these challenges, we must fill important research gaps. By using models and maps to track the spread of fungi, we can better direct resources and prepare for the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aspergillus-fungus-and-human-health"&gt;Aspergillus fungus and human health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fungi account for an estimated 1.5 to 3.8 million species, yet fewer than 10 percent carry official descriptions, and only a sliver have sequenced genomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scarcity of basic data hinders vaccine development and slows the hunt for safer drug targets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing this blind spot, the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; added Aspergillus fungus and &lt;em&gt;Candida&lt;/em&gt; species to its priority list for emerging threats in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers now call for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/future-of-food-safety-ai-can-detect-contamination-early/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;coordinated monitoring&lt;/a&gt; – combining air quality sensors, agricultural sampling, and hospital surveillance – to trace spore movement in near-real time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such efforts could flag hotspots, guide fungicide regulations, and spark investment in rapid diagnostics. Without them, today’s manageable mold may evolve into tomorrow’s silent pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No single fix will erase the risk. Cutting greenhouse gas emissions limits the environmental changes that favor Aspergillus fungus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smarter fungicide policies slow resistance on farms. Better ventilation in buildings reduces indoor spore counts, while new antifungal classes extend doctors’ toolkits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Piece by piece, these steps can keep an ancient decomposer from becoming an outsized menace in a warming world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6545782/v1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Research Square&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jun 2025 21:42:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxQOUEwX2NZUWdFeFJ5SWRnLUNtRzMxT2V5YW05VERMR05lbmdsajM4ZWRLYnYtTkpDdGI4T24yTE12dUk5cENYSXlIOV9ONGV4ODF2dks3NWdOVFlCTGozOC1UamxTdkRtLWdLaUdrME85am9YaXBPNll0WkF0NkhTZ25pbVY0WjFyQ09XdnpFMW9oUmF5dWdKZWFwSHNTYjNjT25TNjJyc015RHhzRzhVSGV2MHBnZmwwNGhfcWJtSjBzbE9nOEVF</guid></item><item><title>经过一系列的肿瘤，女人奇怪的舌头解释了一切--Ars Technica | After a series of tumors, woman’s odd-looking tongue explains everything - Ars Technica</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxNeThPYktJZUdmMlpuWmFYM3VaOUh2aE5PeUg4Y2dyNFZfM0FydUE2aVdlM3NoMUdBY2hCaTBJZlM0V0FNOElwbkhIaV9PRmdxWjNwSE5tQWdRVnJzZmVTSE15QjNKd2NJX21GeFpjSHg3V2R4VlM3WkNSbkIzenJYdElaem5aOHFUNVhXWnc4M1FZaDZRMWFNekVrOUxsVF8xbEF6WF9LaFBCQzZQdW9F?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
                      
                      
          &lt;p&gt;Breast cancer. Colon cancer. An enlarged thyroid gland. A family history of tumors and cancers as well. It wasn't until the woman developed an annoying case of dry mouth that doctors put it all together. By then, she was in her 60s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2835072"&gt;a new case study in JAMA Dermatology&lt;/a&gt;, the woman presented to a dermatology clinic in Spain after three months of oral unpleasantness. They noted the cancers in her medical history. When she opened wide, doctors immediately saw the problem: Her tongue was covered in little wart-like bumps that resembled a slippery, flesh-colored cobblestone path. (Image &lt;a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/dim250007f1_1748619232.52078.png"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a cobblestone tongue is a telltale sign of a rare genetic condition called &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525984/"&gt;Cowden syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. It's caused by inherited mutations that break a protein, called PTEN, leading to tumors and cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PTEN, which stands for phosphatase and tensin homolog, generally helps keep cells from growing out of control. Specifically, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004221004065"&gt;PTEN deactivates a signaling protein called PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate), and that deactivation blocks a signaling pathway (the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway) involved in regulating cell growth, survival, and migration. When PTEN is broken, PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; activity ramps up, and tumors can grow unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Not-so-rare mutation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Cowden syndrome, PTEN mutations lead to noncancerous tumors or masses called hamartomas, which can occur in any organ. But, people with the syndrome are also at high risk of developing a slew of cancerous growths—most commonly cancers of the breast, thyroid, and uterus—over their lifetime. That's why people diagnosed with the condition are advised to undergo intensive cancer screenings, including annual ultrasounds of the thyroid starting at age 7 and annual mammograms and MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging) starting at age 30 at the latest.&lt;/p&gt;

            Prenatal exposure to a class of dangerous, widely used chemicals could be linked to your child having high blood pressure as a teen, according to a new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvv00083b6m3pffytrh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/09/health/pfas-explainer-wellness/index.html"&gt;PFAS&lt;/a&gt; — sometimes called “forever chemicals” because they don’t fully break down in the environment — are a class of about 15,000 human-made chemicals linked to &lt;a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/news-events/news/2023/pfas-kidney-cancer-mec" target="_blank"&gt;cancers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7926449/" target="_blank"&gt;endocrine-related conditions&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9976729/" target="_blank"&gt;developmental problems&lt;/a&gt; in children.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw00093b6mxbrs2c8h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            New data shows the synthetic compounds could also be linked to a teen’s risk of developing cardiovascular disease later in life, according to the study published Thursday in the &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1161/JAHA.124.039949" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of the American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000a3b6me38v9g0e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers looked at data from 1,094 children over an average of 12 years. The study team compared measurements of eight types of PFAS chemicals in maternal plasma samples 24 to 72 hours after birth and the children’s blood pressure from medical records, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000b3b6mk5x624si@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The kids who were exposed to higher levels of PFAS chemicals in utero were more likely to have higher blood pressure in childhood and adolescence, the research found. The connection was particularly strong in adolescents, male children and Black children, said senior study author Dr. Mingyu Zhang, assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000c3b6mvcbp8ejw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study is observational, meaning that while it shows associations, it cannot prove that PFAS exposure is the cause of the elevated blood pressure, Zhang said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000d3b6mu0h79gfs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While researchers did adjust for other factors that could be at play, there could be other elements driving the connection between PFAS and blood pressure, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000e3b6mochkptok@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That said, the results are strong because this study is one of the largest and most diverse while also using rigorous methods, said Dr. Carmen Marsit, Rollins Distinguished Professor of Research at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health in Atlanta. He was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000f3b6mrpcn6j08@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The topic is important to investigate because if a child has high blood pressure, they are more likely to also have higher blood pressure later on, Zhang said. And that is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the No. 1 cause of death in the United States.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000g3b6m4b6eskxf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The largest effects were shown in adolescents who were exposed to a mixture of different PFAS chemicals during pregnancy compared with those who were not, which implies that there may be a synergistic impact on cardiometabolic health, Marsit said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000h3b6mac3daaim@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most children will be exposed to multiple different PFAS chemicals, so this is worrisome,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000i3b6m7ki8f4g9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The fact that adolescence is the age when prenatal exposure to PFAS is most linked with higher blood pressure suggests that some of the PFAS chemicals could take a long period of time to show their impacts, Marsit said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000j3b6mgj1c6ct0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A long latency of the effects would mean that people don’t just need to worry about reducing exposures, but interventions also need to be developed to prevent the health outcomes in people who were exposed earlier, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000k3b6ml1rtwhui@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Not only are PFAS forever chemicals –– they also are everywhere chemicals.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000l3b6m0pakojdp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Data from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm" target="_blank"&gt;National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey&lt;/a&gt; shows that this class of chemicals can be found in nearly every person in the United States, Marsit said &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/09/health/pfas-explainer-wellness"&gt;in a previous CNN story.&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000m3b6mywq959jd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are things you can do to reduce your exposure, however, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000n3b6macy6vjlh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Major sources of exposure include food, water, and waterproof or stain-resistant items, Marsit said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000o3b6m6rsis85p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Helpful steps include drinking filtered water –– using filters like those listed by the Environmental Working Group –– out of metal or glass containers, he said. Plastics contain PFAS and other toxic chemicals, Marsit said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000p3b6mowkak1px@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A focus on fresh food can also help, as packaging for foods are often coated in PFAS chemicals, he added. And avoid using nonstick cookware, opting instead for metal, cast-iron or ceramic pots and pans, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000q3b6m84utj4tc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dusting, vacuuming, and washing your hands before eating or drinking can also reduce PFAS exposure, Marsit said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000r3b6mtn01owi5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Healthy lifestyle choices can reduce the risk of high blood pressure for children who have been exposed to PFAS, Zhang said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000s3b6m1ejcki1s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These include maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet, reducing salt intake, and encouraging physical activity,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000t3b6m1h1a2z27@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But ultimately, an individual cannot solve PFAS exposure alone, Zhang said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbsk9wvw000u3b6mdoolqdbh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We also need policy-level actions to limit and phase out PFAS use in products and industry, and to strengthen monitoring and regulation of PFAS in water systems,” he added.

&lt;hr class="t-copy has-xxl-vert-marg"&gt;
    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Texas officials have notified local public health departments to brace for another $119 million in federal cuts at the end of the month that could impact the state’s disease detection and prevention efforts, including for HIV, diabetes, vaccine outreach and emergency preparedness.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The news comes three months after the federal government notified Texas officials it was prematurely &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/09/texas-public-health-federal-funding-cuts-pandemic/"&gt;clawing back $700 million&lt;/a&gt; in unspent COVID pandemic funding, some of which was used to fight the spread of measles in West Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;With the state’s regular biennial legislative session ending less than two weeks ago, the Texas Department of State Health Services has lost its opportunity to ask the state for more money. Lawmakers left Austin increasing state funds to the agency by $86 million over the next two years, but it also expects to lose $685 million in federal funds due largely to the end of the COVID funds.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Imelda Garcia, chief deputy commissioner for the state health agency, made the disclosure on the latest potential cuts at the agency’s committee on public health funding and policy on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We have staff checking the federal grant solution system every day, multiple times a day. We've made phone calls to our federal partners. However, we still don't have any additional information at this time,” Garcia said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Expiring at the end of June, the $119 million involves Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants that trickle down to local public health departments. Among the potentially hardest hit would be:&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Other programs facing cuts include those to address diabetes, cardiovascular disease, tuberculosis, tobacco use, wastewater testing and some public health-related school funding.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Garcia stressed that while none of the $119 million has been formally cut, Texas health officials have not yet received word that the funding would be renewed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


    
    


  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I wanted to put them on your radar in case there are additional delays that we may see in the coming weeks,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tpr.org/bioscience-medicine/2025-06-03/san-antonio-aids-foundation-pauses-testing-while-the-state-waits-on-word-about-cdc-funding"&gt;On May 30&lt;/a&gt;, Garcia notified health departments to pause HIV prevention and testing spending because the federal government hadn’t notified the state that it will be renewing funding for those services.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Local public health departments were also told this week at the meeting that there could be more cuts by the end of the year. This comes as Texas ranks among the worst in the country for &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/18/texas-covid-pandemic-readiness/"&gt;public health funding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“In a post-covid COVID world, in a world where we've got this measles outbreak and … you're cutting immunizations, I mean, this just does not make any sense,” Dr. Philip Huang, director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services and the committee’s vice chair.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;He said the cuts ran counter to the messaging from U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy who has &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/ny-post-kennedy-op-ed-slashing-unhealthy-fat-hhs.html"&gt;emphasized the federal agency&lt;/a&gt; should be focused on reducing the impact of chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“You say your priorities are chronic disease, and you eliminate the whole Office on Smoking and Health and the FDA tobacco control program,” Huang said. “This doesn't make sense at all.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;When the federal government abruptly cut off $700 million that the state had up until next year to spend, both state and local public health departments laid off employees. In May, the agency offered 63 employees transfers to other divisions and 32 employees were terminated. Of those laid off, 19 were fellows whose tenure ended a week early. Huang noted that he had to lay off more than 20 employees.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Amy Yeager, director of the Bell County Public Health District, noted that the day after she had to temporarily close the district’s health clinic in Temple, the &lt;a href="https://www.kwtx.com/2025/06/03/first-case-measles-confirmed-bell-county-texas/"&gt;city reported its first measles case&lt;/a&gt; involving an unvaccinated man.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Texas has been at the center of a historic measles outbreak that has infected close to &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/22/texas-measles-outbreak-update/"&gt;750 people statewide&lt;/a&gt; and even more across state and international borders. Two children have died and although the number of new cases have decreased in recent weeks, the state can’t consider the outbreak over until there are 42 days without a new infection.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Huang asked Garcia if the CDC could provide any leeway, perhaps, in light of the fact that Texas has been spending so many resources battling the measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I think they're sympathetic, but there's so much going on," Garcia said. "CDC doesn't have a full time director as yet, so they are just having difficulty getting decisions made, is what we have heard."&lt;/p&gt;

Coffee, tea, energy drinks, the works.” For the first three years of her program, she was the only one on her team who drank coffee, so she brought in one of her thrift store coffee makers to keep herself fueled during long days at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'm a coffee addict, so I own 2-3 coffee makers at any given time,” she shares, adding that she always keeps a backup just in case her favorite machine breaks down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, she was the only one who used the office coffee maker, but everything changed in her fourth year when a new postdoctoral associate, Anne, joined the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anne is...a nice person. Friendly. The kind of person you'd take your lunch breaks with or chat with at a company outing,” she writes. But despite Anne’s pleasant demeanor, working with her proved to be challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anne’s presence quickly became overwhelming. The poster admits, “She's always right, and my input is irrelevant (even though I'm more experienced in our field).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation escalated as Anne’s social habits started interfering with work. “She will literally insert herself into my personal space, hovering around my desk until I agree to chat with her about usually total nonsense,” the woman explains, recalling a time Anne wanted to discuss dishwashers at length. The constant interruptions got so bad that she switched to a remote and hybrid work setup just to stay productive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anne also turned out to be a fellow coffee lover, however. “For the first time in over 4 years, my crappy little coffee maker had a second user. And I was happy to share the machine,” she says. Anne became so reliant on the coffee maker, however, that she stopped making coffee at home. As the poster shares, “I am her source of caffeine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, as graduation approaches and the woman prepares to leave for good, she faces a moral quandary. “Would I be the a—--- if I took my coffee maker with me?” she wonders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; Stock photo of a woman working in a lab&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one hand, she acknowledges that Anne would continue to get plenty of use out of the machine, and she herself doesn’t technically need it, since her new workplace provides free coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, Anne’s difficult behavior over the years lingers in her mind. “Anne hasn't exactly been a great coworker. She's made it hard for me to feel productive and intelligent in my position, and I'm petty,” she admits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commenters are offering helpful feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writes one, "Be a grownup.

&lt;p&gt;Dallas County Health and Human Services confirmed its first case of measles in a Dallas County resident for 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to DCHHS, the case involves a female in her mid-20s who was fully vaccinated. She was contagious from May 30, 2025, until June 7, 2025, DCHHS said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;DCHHS said individuals who were at the places at the times listed below may be at risk of developing measles due to exposure to the individual while she was contagious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lemma Coffee Plano&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;1023 E 15th St, Plano, TX 75074&lt;br&gt;May 31, 2025, from 9 a.m. to noon.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Baptist Plano&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;3665 W President George Bush Hwy, Plano, TX 75075&lt;br&gt;June 1, 2025, from 1 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DCHHS officials said the woman has received care, and public health officials are working to identify and notify individuals who may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to DCHHS, this is an ongoing investigation of an isolated case because the source of the woman's exposure to measles is unknown at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our priority is to protect the health and well-being of all Dallas County residents," said Dr. Philip Huang, Director at Dallas County Health and Human Services. "We are actively investigating this case and working to identify any individuals who may have been exposed. The best way to protect yourself from measles is to receive the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are required to receive full protection.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, up to nine out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most kids will recover from measles if they get it, but infection can lead to dangerous complications like pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling, and death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Is the vaccine safe?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine is safe and highly effective in preventing measles infection and severe cases of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old, and the second for children between 4 and 6 years old. The vaccine series is required for kids before kindergarten in public schools nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the vaccine was introduced in 1963, the U.S. saw some 3 million to 4 million cases per year. Now, there are usually fewer than 200 in a normal year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no link between the vaccine and autism, despite a now-discredited study and health disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why do vaccination rates matter?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In communities with high vaccination rates — above 95% — diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called “herd immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60. Five years earlier, measles cases were the worst in almost three decades in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaines County has one of the highest rates in Texas of school-aged children who opt out of at least one required vaccine, with nearly 14% of K-12 children in the 2023-24 school year. Health officials said that number is likely higher because it doesn’t include many children who are homeschooled and whose data would not be reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are public health officials doing to stop the spread?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health workers are hosting regular vaccination clinics and screening efforts in Texas, as well as working with schools to educate people about the importance of vaccination and offering shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creatine is a popular supplement, and one that shows promise in improving your energy, strength and cognition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Taking creatine with food and directly after a workout, for example, can help you improve your strength or even gain muscle mass.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Above all, the purity and safety of the supplement outweighs nailing the timing.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Is it just us, or does it seem like &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; is obsessed with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-high-in-creatine-11731684" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;creatine&lt;/a&gt; right now? Creatine is naturally found in meat and seafood, but it’s made quite the splash in the supplement market in recent years—and for good reason. The natural compound is made of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/should-you-be-taking-an-essential-amino-acid-supplement-11715877" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;amino acids&lt;/a&gt; (the building blocks of protein) arginine, glycine and methionine that can help boost your strength and reduce your recovery time after workouts.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Creatine can also support your cognitive health, says &lt;a href="https://www.topnutritioncoaching.com/nutritionists-near-me/states-nc-charlotte#danielle-smith" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;Danielle Crumble Smith, RD&lt;/a&gt;. Research shows that creatine supplementation may enhance short term memory and improve intelligence and reasoning.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With all of these potential benefits on the table, you may be wondering, is there an ideal window of time to take a creatine supplement to get the best effects? Experts say there is, but it depends on your goals as well as the type of creatine you take. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-types-of-creatine-supplements"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Types of Creatine Supplements &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;There are several types of creatine; however, some forms are more popular and heavily researched than others. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creatine monohydrate:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the most common type of creatine, says sports dietitian &lt;a href="https://roxanaehsani.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Roxana Ehsani, RD, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s commonly used by athletes and bodybuilders looking to increase strength, muscle mass and power,” she says. Smith adds this variety is also the most studied. “This form is used in the vast majority of clinical studies and has been proven to support muscle performance, cognitive health, mood and hormonal balance across the lifespan,” she says.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creatine hydrochloride (HCl):&lt;/strong&gt; This type of creatine may be helpful for those with sensitive stomachs or experience side effects when taking other forms of creatine, Ehsani says. In other words, if you bloat easily, this supplement may be the best choice for you. Creatine HCl is often marketed as being more soluble than other forms, Smith says, which is why its recommended serving is often at a lower dose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buffered creatine, creatine ethyl ester, creatine nitrate, creatine blends: &lt;/strong&gt;These are a few other options you may see in a supplement store or sold online, but the research on their efficacy is scarce, the experts say.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-factors-affecting-creatine-absorption"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Factors Affecting Creatine Absorption  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Creatine can change the game for your health and well-being when it has the chance to flourish in your body. When it comes to identifying the best time of day to take creatine for maximum effect, you’ll want to keep these factors in mind. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Factors That Enhance Absorption &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timing with exercise.&lt;/strong&gt; “Taking creatine directly post-workout may improve the absorption rate as your body is more primed to accept these nutrients,” Ehsani says. Between increased blood flow to muscles and your cells being more insulin sensitive, creatine can enter into your muscles more quickly. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mealtime pairings. &lt;/strong&gt;“Taking creatine with a meal that includes carbohydrates and protein can enhance its absorption because insulin helps shuttle creatine into muscle cells,” Smith says. If your goal is to focus on muscle growth and strength enhancement, you’ll want to take creatine around mealtime or post-workout with an appropriate snack or &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7964007/best-protein-shakes-protein-powders/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein shake&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hormonal shifts. &lt;/strong&gt;“Women’s estrogen levels impact creatine metabolism and storage,” Smith says. “During low-estrogen phases, such as post-menopause, luteal phase or when taking certain hormonal birth controls, pairing higher creatine doses with food may improve absorption and tissue uptake, which supports both physical and cognitive benefits.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Factors That Prevent Absorption &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too much creatine in muscle stores.&lt;/strong&gt; “If your muscles are already saturated with creatine, due to prolonged use, your body may absorb less of it,” Ehsani says. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dehydration. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/17576/8-hydrating-foods-to-help-you-meet-your-water-goals/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Hydration&lt;/a&gt; helps your body use creatine more efficiently, Smith says, so without adequate fluid intake, your body may not be able to reap all of creatine’s benefits. “Taking creatine when well-hydrated—and maintaining good daily fluid intake throughout the day—helps optimize both muscle uptake and cognitive energy effects.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waiting too long after a workout. &lt;/strong&gt;You can miss that prime window to maximize your muscle strength gains if you take creatine a few hours after you exercise, Ehsani says. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-potential-side-effects-and-considerations"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Potential Side Effects and Considerations  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Everyone responds to supplements differently, and creatine isn’t an exception (despite all of its benefits). A few common side effects include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stomach upset.&lt;/strong&gt; First timers may have some gastrointestinal symptoms like cramping, nausea or diarrhea. “It may be helpful to break up your dose into 2 to 3 servings per day or switch to a different form,” Ehsani says. For example, you may consider taking 2.5 milligram (mg) doses twice daily instead of 5 mg all at once. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Water retention.&lt;/strong&gt; Creatine pulls fluids into your muscle cells. “When you first take creatine, you may notice some water retention in your body,” Ehsani says. “For some people this only lasts for the first few days of use.” If you feel &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8068909/sneaky-reasons-for-bloating/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;bloated&lt;/a&gt;, know creatine isn’t making you suddenly gain weight. “It’s simply water shifting into muscles, which is actually beneficial for muscle hydration and function,” Smith says.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kidney stress. &lt;/strong&gt;Smith says she hears this concern quite a bit, but many studies show that creatine does not harm kidney function in healthy kidneys.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “However, those with pre-existing kidney disease should consult with their healthcare provider, as their ability to process creatine may be impaired,” Smith says. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When in doubt, talk to your health care provider or a registered dietitian to see if adding a creatine supplement to your diet is the right choice for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-choose-a-creatine-supplement"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How to Choose a Creatine Supplement &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;br&gt;Not only does the timing and the form of creatine matter, but how the supplement was created and tested is another big consideration to keep in mind—especially if you’re a competitive athlete. “Look for products that list creatine monohydrate as the only active ingredient,” Smith says. You want to avoid supplements that list proprietary blends and unnecessary fillers, for example.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Product purity and safety are arguably the most important pieces of information to research before buying a supplement, whether it’s a powder or capsule. “The supplement industry is not tightly regulated, and creatine is sometimes contaminated with heavy metals, solvents, or impurities from poor manufacturing,” Smith says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This is why doing your research and choosing third-party tested products is vital. Look for supplements that carry one or more of these third-party certifications:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Creatine isn’t overhyped—it really can be a powerful supplement. From getting a boost in mental clarity to enhancing your recovery post-workout, creatine can help you achieve various health goals. But to get these benefits, you may want to stay hydrated and consider pairing your supplement with carbs and proteins for optimal absorption.
