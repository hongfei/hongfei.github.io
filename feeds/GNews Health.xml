The symptoms for heart-related problems are not dramatic as much; they are slow, silent, and gradually build up in our arteries that can lead to a life-changing event. Vascular surgeon, Dr. Sumit Kapadia, with 18 years of experience, cautions that even the foods that we find comforting might quietly be increasing the risk of heart attacks in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But shockingly, it's not just fried rare treats or greasy food-seemingly harmless staples and trendy packaged foods open the gateway to arterial damage. The danger lies in how these six food groups, cherished and widely consumed, quietly raise blood pressure, blood sugar, and inflammation until your arteries cry out for help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Seven Daily Habits to Prevent Heart Attacks Revealed &amp;amp; Boost Heart Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Processed Foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed items like seekh kebabs, sausages, salami, and mutton curries are full of saturated fat and sodium. With time, these foods harden the arteries and provoke inflammation, acting as a main reason for heart problems. High saturated fat levels gradually lead to a buildup of cholesterol in the arteries, while too much sodium increases blood pressure, both of which contribute to arterial hardening and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What starts as an occasional indulgence can, over the years, turn into a major risk factor if not balanced with healthier choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fried street food&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samosas, pakoras, bhajiyas, puris, and French fries aren’t just tempting; they’re risky when cooked in reused oils, which produce dangerous trans fats. These fats do more than just clog your arteries; they accelerate plaque buildup and amplify the risk of heart attacks, even in the young and healthy. Reused oils produce trans fat, a harmful type that clogs the arteries and also triggers inflammation and plaque buildup inside them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Refined carbs &amp;amp; maida-based food&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our favourite food options, like white bread, naan, pav, biscuits, pastries, and bakery puff, are prepared with refined flour-also known as maida or refined flour. These quickly raise blood sugar levels and initiate body-wide inflammation, promoting the development of cholesterol-rich plaques in the heart arteries. Over time, these constant fluctuations can lead to insulin resistance and chronic inflammation throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sweetened drinks &amp;amp; packaged juices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar-loaded colas, energy drinks, canned fruit juices, and flavored lassis might sound refreshing, but they raise triglyceride levels and put additional pressure on your heart. Consuming these drinks daily has been related to the risk of sudden cardiac death as they interfere with heart rhythm and blood lipids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;High salt in pickles, namkee, and other foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indian meals are always full of pickles, 'papad', instant noodles, chips, and salty snacks, all loaded with sodium. High intake of salt retains water in your body and heightens blood pressure, inviting heart attacks and strokes. This is the risk which, for many, lies hidden in the taste of daily favorites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Ultra-processed foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, instant noodles, frozen parathas, ready-to-eat curries, chips, and packaged sauces come packed with hidden fats, sugar, and preservatives. Each serving of ultra-processed food can increase your heart risk by an alarming 7 percent—proof that convenience at the cost of health is rarely worth it in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A warning that can save lives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advice of Dr. Kapadia is the same, yet very powerful: avoid these six food groups and shut the entrance door to future heart attacks. Every meal we eat might be small, last a few minutes, but it requires us to make powerful choices that shape our heart's future. Let those choices be guided by awareness and balance. A little mindfulness goes a long way...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The choices you make at every meal quietly shape your cardiovascular fate, so let wisdom guide your plate. Even amidst cultural traditions and busy lifestyles, mindful eating can safeguard your heart and keep the silent dangers at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 16:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAJBVV95cUxNTE9TWEE4QnNib001cW5nRE5qY2hSeWo3SGM1SWtpcDYyM0VpRnpXZWd5RklsVDRGU2JfbzBSNlJVdnVJYVY3UWpqQlNDMVRDRjZqMGtsTC1ZN05ucXRxSlRIQ0VJRUp4VGxKbGNoYm5QZlN4TUNMejBJU01hTTV4TmpDUDhuQmFtdm14Qk9vY2NFMnh5eXRRMVdFenRTWFJwUmtlck1PSFp3dnhHOTYycGdUZ3BlT2lpTzNpNFR2bFlRR096Y1hiTUZpUEhqdmg4eHdvV0czempoT2hDclZZbnZ3T2VhaUF0YV9uMlZrdzNGZ2FmM0lwNDBTMm42b1Z5STJCM25FQzc</guid></item><item><title>我们与另一对已婚夫妇度过了一个狂野的夜晚。一个丈夫为错误的人参加了狂欢节。-石板</title><link>https://slate.com/advice/2025/11/alcohol-husband-sex-drinking-group-wife-advice.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="108" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf9ftt2001f3b787crws39m@published"&gt;Let’s say you’re in a couple play situation where there is lots of alcohol involved and one husband is feral for the other guy’s wife, to the exclusion of everything else. If his wife is upset by this, and there is almost zero chance the drinking will be less, it seems like continuing the play another time will just lead to more hurt. Is there a way through this? The husband is not interested in moving forward if his wife is hurt by his drunken behavior, but is it worth trying again if his intent is to be more conscious of how his wife is doing during play?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="97" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf9fu2o001i3b78o1i8xdlh@published"&gt;I think the most prudent thing to do here is to consider what the emotional fallout will be if the same thing were to happen again. You’ve written your letter in a hypothetical voice without identifying yourself, which is uncommon for this column, but I have a hunch that if you’re in this configuration, you’re the wife. If that is true, envision what a scenario will be like if your husband follows the same pattern. Will it be upsetting, devastating, relationship-upending? Something else? What exactly would you be risking if the worst-case scenario were to play out?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="115" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf9fu5j001j3b78b9mcmkky@published"&gt;One positive here is that the husband no longer can claim plausible deniability should he zero in on a single target and others’ feelings catch strays in the process. He knows what happened last time. If alcohol clouded his judgement, he should take it upon himself to drink less—if getting loaded in the presence of available alcohol (and nonmonogamous sex) is an inevitability, that may signal an issue with substances or a general discomfort with this kind of play. Both should be interrogated. I know people love to get drunk and screw, but if they &lt;em&gt;have to&lt;/em&gt; get drunk to screw, they might want to think about why and consider other means of social lubrication.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="57" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf9fu91001k3b78jzdthyr0@published"&gt;Another positive here is that he actively does not want to upset his wife again, which suggests he’s learning. Now is the time for the wife to voice her boundaries and for him to accept them. If these are successfully adhered to, you will both have grown from a negative situation, perhaps rendering it all worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="148" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf9fuc7001l3b783575zfk0@published"&gt;So, I say give him another chance unless you (I mean … the wife) are fairly sure that a repetition of the first time will cause irreparable damage. Obviously, he’s extremely into another woman there and part of the point of this kind of play is for people to have their fun. But it truly should not be to the exclusion of everything else, including consideration for one’s partner. If he truly cannot maintain that very meager standard, this kind of play should probably be taken off the table entirely. But you should also consider the fact that his interest for at least one other woman will likely endure whether you go forward and incorporate her into group sex or not. If the very fact of his attraction is bothersome or distracting, it may deserve a sober discussion and your own efforts to come to terms with it.&lt;/p&gt;

I don’t enjoy anal, either. I love closeness and intimacy, including kissing and cuddling, and I am happy to give orally, but getting my dick sucked does nothing for me, nor does penetrating another guy and nor does bottoming. None of it is uncomfortable and I enjoy giving pleasure to others, but none of it is as satisfying as masturbation. Is there something wrong with me?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="158" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf9q76u002x3b78smjbc3oi@published"&gt;There’s a good chance there’s nothing “wrong” with you here. Maybe this is just how you are, and all the psychological searching you can muster (alone and/or with a therapist) won’t give you any answers. Maybe you just know what you like and what you don’t. Giving pleasure is a great thing, and there are guys who identify as cocksuckers who know this well. If masturbation is your primary vehicle for pleasure, maybe you’re a bator. Maybe you are somewhere on the asexuality spectrum (some deep thinking on the subject, by reading a book like Angela Chen’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ace-Asexuality-Reveals-Identity-Meaning-ebook/dp/B07Y7H1WT9/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.kUEjXggB_7ggqNfz6k5l9CeMsuUoEMrPtAf932EMoLkRyJt6T1oNSaxDjzaUcPCOq_oYAMscOBxFhdZleUV1LR82ic00Rf3f9R6vBc4xHiqVBPMyR7Bmf7ZiSoYVFfRLif6TptxOirtny5lNPHmXyg.R-bIgGONNmYTuYiVCC65wBJvxqdmM7QGNVgmJnemEHA&amp;amp;qid=1761851333&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or browsing/participating in the discussion at &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/"&gt;r/asexuality&lt;/a&gt; could be useful). Maybe none of these labels appeal to you. My sense is that you’re navigating your body’s responses to sex very well and still finding activities that are fun. If you can be at peace with where you are sexually, that’s more than can be said for a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="195" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmhf9q76u002y3b78bae8cffj@published"&gt;If, however, this is distressing and something you’d like to work on changing, definitely seek the services of a therapist (preferably a sex therapist, or even a sex coach) who can help you sort out whether these feelings might be a response to something that’s happened in your life or just a regular facet of your particular sexuality. There are no guarantees that you will be changed by the process—nor do I think you need to be—but the more you think about it and the more you attempt to work on it, the more likely such a change will occur. We can’t say for certain what’s going on from here, but if you’ve exhausted all potential reasons and this continues to bother you, you may want to look into whether what you’re experiencing is sexual anhedonia, a condition marked by an inability to feel sexual pleasure. It has many &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/a43455963/sexual-anhedonia/"&gt;potential causes&lt;/a&gt;, physical (like low testosterone, neurological issues, or medication) and psychological (depression, performance anxiety), alike. A visit to a doctor, hopefully one with whom you are comfortable discussing sex, may be illuminating. Let them know what’s going on, as they may want to run tests.&lt;/p&gt;

He’s been begging to try this since early on in our relationship. I’ve always hesitated because it took me a while to open up to and get comfortable with being eaten out in the first place. With butt stuff, I’m especially nervous because of cleanliness issues even after a shower. What if it smells or he gets dirty or it’s gross! I don’t want to turn him off entirely! But I also admit I’m curious about it and think I could be into it. How do I get past my fears and give this a shot?&lt;/p&gt;

Things that may complicate this solution include stray hairs that poop can cling to (especially if you are less than thorough with your wash) and fecal incontinence. If you have no reason to suspect you experience the latter (and you’d know), you’re already ahead of the game. To keep things extra tidy, you can trim the hair around your hole (I personally trust the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0CLWH333W/?_encoding=UTF8&amp;amp;pd_rd_plhdr=t&amp;amp;aaxitk=28a358c8be016b730e11e90c73409006&amp;amp;hsa_cr_id=0&amp;amp;qid=1761506763&amp;amp;sr=1-1-9e67e56a-6f64-441f-a281-df67fc737124&amp;amp;ref_=sbx_be_s_sparkle_dlcd_asin_0_title&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=VlfpI&amp;amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.9f2b2b9e-47e9-4764-a4dc-2be2f6fca36d:amzn1.sym.9f2b2b9e-47e9-4764-a4dc-2be2f6fca36d&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=9f2b2b9e-47e9-4764-a4dc-2be2f6fca36d&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=3HKJH7ES5X9X4QSPK0QM&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=JCM99&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=70b7d3bc-1c66-4571-9284-87e350b0597b"&gt;Philips Norelco OneBlade Intimate&lt;/a&gt;, as it’s never nicked me unlike virtually every other shaver I’ve used, even ones marketed for “intimate” areas).

Still, if you fear there’s any poop lingering around your rectum that may present itself during play, washing out a few times with water (filter it if you’re using tap and the water in your area isn’t suited for drinking) with a small bulb (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pure-Men-Detachable-Reusable-Capacity/dp/B0C6B2B35B/ref=sr_1_8?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.c8CU8QHctZ3sGts0WvMHmvu6QH0tc5liZAZiOcWJEsd2So5iHTlt6ZDVvMduKgaAYjDVxOWW9RS-YTDOHHVzg38iNlfH07YWYroNtbvx6Td4vy8vE5a4QqG_aLGvKwcohX_8ROAG3oW3F8vvqXiro1KtF9Vuofmy1HC-edQC8j5Mw3cNzdHKTAIWeIQgQ7nsZgtc6Bvj_-e12VFNmedQ8fUx8zKym5164SI1gNL_xzEACqHIa8bWe6RnSKvDeFHvXW9GaBmGSvACEn1r2l3rr2uk6Os_9MeH_hkRX_payKM.oMYVURE242HER0a2ad8fv2qPX0MAs70fvCf-b5A6GF4&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=stay+ready+douche&amp;amp;qid=1761506961&amp;amp;sr=8-8"&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt;) may help you feel hygienically secure. Regular fiber supplementation via psyllium husk could also help quell your fears. It helps bulk stool, often leaving little to none behind after a bowel movement.&lt;/p&gt;

A mishap is unlikely to turn him off entirely. Or if it does, then you’d be no worse off than you are now—at least you will have tried this thing that you’re both curious about. So try to put those concerns out of your mind if you’re going to go forward with this. Probably the most effective thing you can do is just go through with it—take necessary steps to clean yourself as much as possible and let him have at it. You may gain a lot of confidence and security when the ass eating goes off without a hitch. It’ll show you that you can do this and make next time even easier to get into. Of course, if you do feel discomfort, unclean or any kind of vague negativity, you have every right to stop the session, but I would follow my curiosity if I were &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That’s because I’m lucky enough to orgasm in that way. Occasionally, I’ll have an enjoyable orgasm that’s a little more restrained. But for the most part, I’m full-on Meg Ryan in the restaurant scene in &lt;em&gt;When Harry met Sally&lt;/em&gt;, except mine is real and not at all a performance. I realize this is the opposite of a problem. However, my question is: &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/10/loud-climax-sex-advice.html"&gt;Have most or even all of my partners assumed I’m probably faking it?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Through in-depth interviews, researchers found that these experiences often begin in childhood, are felt as a deep, internal sensation, and can be integrated into a person’s sexual life. This work builds on more than a decade of research that challenges the common understanding of orgasm as a strictly sexual event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was conducted by a team at The Center for Sexual Health Promotion at Indiana University, led by Debby Herbenick, a prominent sexuality researcher. The scientific rationale for these studies stems from a desire to understand the full spectrum of human orgasmic response. Before this work began, the phenomenon was mostly a subject of popular curiosity, often called a “coregasm” in magazines and online forums because of its frequent association with abdominal workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While orgasm is almost exclusively discussed in sexual contexts, historical medical literature and early sexuality research, like the Kinsey reports, had occasionally noted orgasms occurring during non-sexual activities. However, these observations were limited, and a scientific gap remained between the popular buzz and empirical evidence. By systematically investigating this phenomenon, the researchers hoped to gain a clearer picture of the physiological and psychological processes of orgasm, independent of sexual fantasy or direct genital stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This line of inquiry began with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14681994.2011.647902" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a foundational study&lt;/a&gt; in 2011. The researchers conducted an anonymous, internet-based survey of 530 women who had experienced either orgasm or sexual pleasure during exercise. The goal was to systematically describe a phenomenon that had, until then, been confined to popular media articles and scattered case reports. This initial study was exploratory, aiming to identify which exercises were most commonly associated with these experiences and what the experiences felt like for the women involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings from that first survey established a baseline understanding. Among women who reported exercise-induced orgasms, the most common activities were abdominal exercises, climbing poles or ropes, and lifting weights. A large portion of these women reported feeling self-conscious about their experience, particularly when exercising in public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The data also showed that sexual thoughts or fantasies were rarely associated with these orgasms, suggesting the experience was primarily physiological rather than psychological in origin. For women who experienced sexual pleasure without orgasm, biking or spinning was frequently identified, along with abdominal exercises and weight lifting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeking to understand the prevalence of this phenomenon in the general population, the research team conducted &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-021-01996-9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a follow-up study&lt;/a&gt; using data from the 2014 National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior. This survey involved a nationally representative probability sample of over 2,000 U.S. adolescents and adults, allowing for a much broader and more generalizable analysis. This study was the first to provide population-level estimates for exercise-induced orgasm and included men in its analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2021 study revealed that approximately 9% of the survey respondents reported having experienced an orgasm during exercise at least once in their lifetime. There was no statistically significant difference in the prevalence between men and women. The researchers did find a gender difference in the age of first experience, with women reporting a mean age of about 23, while men reported a mean age of about 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The types of exercises associated with the first experience were consistent with the 2011 findings and included abdominal exercises, climbing, and weight lifting for both genders. The analysis also identified an association between having an exercise-induced orgasm and having an orgasm during sleep, but not with having an orgasm during a recent partnered sexual event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most recent study, published in 2025, moved from quantitative surveys to qualitative interviews to capture the rich, lived experiences of women. The research team conducted in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 21 women, ranging in age from 19 to 68, who had a history of exercise-induced orgasms. The interviews took place in a setting equipped with exercise mats and a Roman chair, allowing participants to demonstrate, if they felt comfortable, the specific movements that led to their experiences. This method allowed for a detailed exploration of their personal histories, physical sensations, and emotional responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key finding from these interviews was that the first experience with exercise-induced arousal or orgasm often occurred during childhood or early adolescence. Many women recalled feeling these sensations as young as five or six years old while climbing poles on a playground, doing gymnastics, or performing sit-ups in physical education class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, they were often confused by the sensations, with several participants describing the initial feeling as a sense that they needed to urinate. They lacked a framework for understanding what was happening to their bodies, but they recognized the feeling was pleasurable and, in some cases, sought to reproduce it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The participants often described an “aha” moment, which typically occurred later in adolescence or adulthood, when they gained more sexual knowledge from peers, media, or their own sexual experiences. It was at this point they connected their childhood sensations with the concept of arousal and orgasm. One woman recounted how making out with someone for the first time made her realize, “This is the same feeling, how strange.” This moment of recognition helped them make sense of a long-standing, and sometimes bewildering, bodily experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interviews provided detailed descriptions of how an exercise-induced orgasm feels physically. Many women characterized it as a deep, internal sensation, originating in the lower abdomen between the belly button and the pelvis. They often contrasted this with orgasms from direct clitoral stimulation, which they described as more external.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some participants noted a progression of sensations, starting with a warmth or tingling in their core that would build and radiate downward. The experience was often predictable, with women learning that orgasm would occur after a certain number of repetitions of an exercise, such as after 50 leg lifts or during the third set of pull-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The emotional responses to these experiences were complex and often evolved over time. Embarrassment and shame were common, especially when the orgasms occurred in public spaces like a gym or during a group fitness class. Participants worried that others might notice their facial expressions or hear them make sounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some developed strategies to mask the experience, like keeping a serious facial expression, or to avoid it altogether by choosing different exercises. These feelings were sometimes rooted in cultural or familial taboos around sexuality, which made experiencing an orgasm in a non-sexual, public setting feel inappropriate or wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these negative feelings, many women came to accept and even enjoy their ability to have orgasms through exercise. Some viewed it as a motivator to work out, an “added perk at the end of the 100 reps.” Others described it as an empowering experience that gave them a sense of control over their own pleasure, independent of a partner. One woman explained that if she was not getting the attention she needed from her husband, exercise was another way to achieve the stress release of an orgasm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A significant finding was how some women integrated their knowledge of exercise-induced orgasms into their sexual lives. After learning which muscle contractions produced pleasure during exercise, they were able to apply similar movements during partnered sex. One participant explained that she could tense her core muscles to achieve a stronger or faster orgasm, sometimes allowing her to climax at the same time as her partner. For some, exercise became a form of masturbation or foreplay, and for one woman, it was the only way she had been able to experience orgasm until recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies have some limitations. The initial survey used a convenience sample, which cannot be used to determine prevalence. The new qualitative study involved a small number of participants who were mostly young, white, and living in the United States, so their experiences may not reflect those of a more diverse population. Future research is needed to explore these experiences among men, gender-diverse individuals, people from different cultural backgrounds, and older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major direction for future research is to understand the physiological mechanism behind exercise-induced orgasms. It is still not known precisely how muscle contractions during certain exercises trigger an orgasmic response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subsequent studies could involve biomechanical analysis, neuro-imaging, or other physiological measures to investigate the roles of muscle tension, nerve pathways, and the sympathetic nervous system. A better understanding of the mechanism could have practical applications for physical therapists, personal trainers, and even military personnel who must pass rigorous fitness tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14681994.2011.647902" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Exercise-induced orgasm and pleasure among women&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Debby Herbenick and J.

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/topics/creatine-10045"&gt;Creatine&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most widely used sports supplements across the world. It's taken by many in the hopes of boosting strength, enhancing athletic performance, and promoting muscle growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it isn't only adults who are using this supplement. A growing number of teenagers and young adults report &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/a68812063/should-teenagers-take-creatine/"&gt;taking creatine&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes of reaping the supplement's benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveys show that as many as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6611041/"&gt;72% of male athletes&lt;/a&gt; aged 17-18 report using creatine. Use is typically &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/1550-2783-5-2"&gt;more common among athletes&lt;/a&gt;, especially young men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pomegranates-could-limit-risks-from-controversial-sports-supplement"&gt;Pomegranates Could Limit Risks From Controversial Sports Supplement&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While creatine is generally considered to be safe for young people to use, it's no shortcut to getting fit. It's better for young people looking to get strong or improve their athletic performance to focus on the fundamentals: exercising, eating properly, and prioritising sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatine is a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2021.104568"&gt;natural compound&lt;/a&gt; stored within muscle. Although a small amount is produced in the kidneys and liver, most (around 95%) is obtained from eating meat and seafood. Creatine plays an important role in providing energy during high-intensity activities, such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-017-0173-z"&gt;sprinting and lifting weights&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179717" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179717" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/weight_lifter_with_dumbbells_642.jpg" alt="man with dumbells" class="wp-image-179717 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/weight_lifter_with_dumbbells_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/weight_lifter_with_dumbbells_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179717" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Creatine provides extra energy to muscles for high-intensity activities. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAC9JJETQoI/"&gt;DorianGray/Getty Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although several forms of creatine are commercially available, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu17172748"&gt;creatine monohydrate&lt;/a&gt; is the most stable and extensively studied form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous studies show that creatine supplementation enhances performance in high-intensity exercises requiring strength and power, such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu17172748"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; and sprinting. Creatine supplementation may also lead to more &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15092116"&gt;muscle growth&lt;/a&gt; when combined with resistance training, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13061915"&gt;faster recovery&lt;/a&gt; from exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging research also suggests that creatine's benefits extend beyond the gym. Studies indicate that creatine may improve aspects of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2024.1424972"&gt;cognitive function&lt;/a&gt; – specifically memory and attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatine also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2015.12.034"&gt;shows promise&lt;/a&gt; for older adults in preventing muscle loss and protecting against neurological disorders such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="179707" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="179707" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Creatine's safety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typical diet that includes meat and seafood provides around &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jff.2021.104568"&gt;1–2 grams of creatine&lt;/a&gt; per day, which keeps the muscles around 60–80% full of creatine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a daily creatine supplement eventually fills the muscles with creatine. There are two common ways to do this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quickest and most commonly studied method involves a one-week loading phase. This entails taking 0.3 grams of creatine per kilogram of body weight four times a day. For example, a 75kg person would take a total of 24g of creatine per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-017-0173-z/"&gt;alternative approach&lt;/a&gt;, which increases muscle creatine levels more gradually, is to take 3g of creatine per day for around 28 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both approaches will fill muscle creatine stores. The first (loading) approach tops up creatine stores faster, which means you'll see benefits to exercise performance faster. However, the second approach is less likely to cause temporary &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15502783.2025.2488937"&gt;gastrointestinal discomfort&lt;/a&gt; (such as bloating and diarrhoea) which are more common when using the loading approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what approach you use, taking 3- &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5g" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73071" data-postid="179707" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;5g&lt;/a&gt; of creatine daily is necessary to maintain muscle creatine levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15502783.2025.2488937"&gt;Numerous studies show&lt;/a&gt; that short and long-term creatine supplementation (up to 30g a day for five years) is safe and has no ill effects on health when taken at the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15502783.2025.2488937"&gt;recommended dosages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common side effect of creatine is weight gain as the supplement &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/physiolgenomics.00157.2007"&gt;increases water retention&lt;/a&gt; in muscles. This extra water remains only as long as you're taking creatine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Creatine and young people&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although creatine is shown to be safe and effective for adults, only a few studies have investigated the effects among children and adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The available studies show that creatine &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2018.00115"&gt;appears to be safe&lt;/a&gt; for young people to use and can provide &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13020664"&gt;performance benefits&lt;/a&gt;, particularly for athletes. Most studies have only looked at the safety of a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-017-0162-2"&gt;creatine dosage&lt;/a&gt; between 0.1g and 0.3g per kg of body mass per day. As such, it's important that any young people who choose to use creatine do not exceed this dosage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although creatine appears to be safe for children and adolescents to take, it is possible that, without proper nutrition education and supervision of dosing, they could be at risk of misusing creatine – potentially leading to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-017-0173-z"&gt;adverse effects&lt;/a&gt; such as stomach cramps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_179721" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-179721" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/man_stomach_cramps_642.jpg" alt="man with stomach cramps" class="wp-image-179721 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/man_stomach_cramps_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/man_stomach_cramps_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-179721" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Stomach cramps can be an adverse effect of misusing creatine. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEpfy0r27A/"&gt;SHOTPRIME/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study that evaluated young athletes' understanding of how sports supplements &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-019-0294-7"&gt;should be used&lt;/a&gt; reported that only 11% of the athletes answered questions correctly about creatine use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of age, it's important to recognise that supplements such as creatine are not a shortcut to improving fitness, building muscle, or losing body fat. Supplements provide much &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2025.1663860"&gt;smaller performance gains&lt;/a&gt; compared to what can be achieved through good training and nutrition alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While sports supplements support training and recovery, significant progress comes from consistent exercise, a balanced diet, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2017.00564"&gt;adequate sleep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a well-designed training programme and healthy eating plan, young people will experience rapid improvements in strength, power, and endurance without the need for supplements. Focusing too soon on taking supplements could &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/her/18.1.98"&gt;distract young people&lt;/a&gt; from building good training habits and healthy eating patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why most sport nutritionists recommend using a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1123/ijsnem.2021-0335"&gt;food-first approach&lt;/a&gt;, which focuses on maximising diet quality before recommending supplements such as creatine.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267365/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/paul-hough-2282013"&gt;Paul Hough&lt;/a&gt;, Lecturer Sport &amp;amp; Exercise Physiology , &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/university-of-westminster-916"&gt;University of Westminster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

As the evenings close in and the mornings grow murky, energy ebbs and a heavy sadness settles in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Although seasonal affective disorder (Sad) was only formally recognised by psychiatrists in the 1980s, the link between the seasons, mood and vitality has long been observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Medicine – a Chinese text from roughly 300BC – described how the seasons affect all living things. It advised that in winter, one should “retire early and get up with the sunrise”, keeping “desires and mental activity quiet and subdued, as if keeping a happy secret”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Today, scientists are rediscovering how closely tuned our biology is to the seasons. According to Dr Cathy Wyse, a chancellor’s research fellow at the University of Edinburgh, the biggest advance over the past decade “has been the realisation that seasonal changes in human mood are probably endogenous – that they’re part of our physiology”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Large-scale resources such as &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/apr/18/uk-biobank-is-safely-sharing-health-data-to-drive-medical-research" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt; have transformed this area of research, allowing scientists to track seasonal patterns across hundreds of thousands of people over many years – something that was previously impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, where to draw the line between normal winter sluggishness and clinical depression is not straightforward. Sad is recognised as a subtype of major depression or bipolar disorder, defined by its predictable seasonal pattern: symptoms typically begin in autumn or winter and lift in spring. Alongside typical signs of depression, people often sleep longer, feel lethargic and want to eat more, particularly carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The triggers of these changes are still being investigated, but they are almost certainly linked to reduced daylight. Light is the key regulator of our internal body or circadian clock, influencing the timing of hormone release, alertness and mood. Without sufficient daylight – especially when combined with too much artificial light in the evenings – these rhythms can drift out of sync with the external world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="4bd39955-f577-4324-88ab-06658bf4a4f5" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Amish people in the US, who spend more time outdoors and less time exposed to artificial light at night, have some of the lowest Sad rates among Caucasian populations.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some people may be more sensitive to this shift than others. Wyse and her colleagues are studying seasonal effects in &lt;a href="https://www.heliosbd.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt;, where manic episodes often peak in spring and depression tends to be more common in the darker months. “We suspect that people with bipolar disorder may be very sensitive to light and seasonal cues, and that’s triggering their symptoms,” said Wyse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Even among those without clinical depression, many people experience a milder seasonal dip in mood, known as subsyndromal Sad or “the winter blues”. In the UK, an estimated one in five people are affected, though only about 2% experience full Sad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet, seasonal biology extends far beyond mood. Researchers have found fluctuations in the expression of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8000" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more than 4,000 protein-coding genes&lt;/a&gt; in white blood cells and fat, along with changes in the cellular composition of blood itself across the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Wyse and her colleagues recently analysed four years of UK Biobank sleep data from half a million people. “We found that in winter, people tended to sleep longer and had increased sleeplessness – their sleep wasn’t so good as in the summer,” said Wyse, who will present these findings at the British Sleep Society conference in Brighton next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However natural these seasonal changes may be, society still expects people to carry on as normal. Few of us can hibernate, however tempting that may sound. The most effective antidote to the winter slump is light. Bright light therapy remains the gold standard for treating Sad, though timing and dosage are critical (see below). For those unable to manage a daily session in front of a light box, natural sunlight is a powerful substitute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="aae49198-892e-44fa-813c-7151b7917e50" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-9ktzqp"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;‘Early morning light is especially powerful in resetting the circadian clock.’&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Rebecca Cole/The Guardian&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Studies of Amish communities in the US – who spend more time outdoors and less time exposed to bright artificial light at night – show some of the lowest Sad rates recorded among Caucasian populations. By contrast, the prevalence in New York is about 4.7%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Exposure to bright, natural light early in the day helps to synchronise the circadian clock and suppress lingering melatonin, a night-time hormone that may make a person feel groggy. Light also has a direct alerting effect: one study found that an hour of blue-enriched light boosted reaction times more than the equivalent of two cups of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But light isn’t the whole story. Cognitive behavioural therapy tailored for Sad can be &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25859764/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;as effective as light therapy&lt;/a&gt;, helping people reframe their relationship with winter rather than just manage symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Winter will come regardless. By shifting how we think about it, we can reclaim some joy from the darker months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-to-beat-the-winter-blues" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;How to beat the winter blues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;footer class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;ul class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seek the morning sun: &lt;/strong&gt;Even on grey days, step outside as early as possible. Daylight resets your circadian clock, improves alertness and suppresses melatonin. Early morning light is especially powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try a light box: &lt;/strong&gt;Brightness levels are measured in lux. A typical Sad lamp will emit light at about 10,000 lux – 20 to 40 times brighter than typical office lighting, and roughly equivalent to outdoor light on an overcast summer’s day. Sit in front of it for 20–30 minutes soon after waking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check your sleep habits: &lt;/strong&gt;Stick to regular sleep and wake times, avoid screens late at night and keep evening lighting warm and dim. This helps prevent your internal rhythms from drifting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get outside – properly:&lt;/strong&gt; Even on a cloudy day in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;January, outdoor light is roughly 10 times brighter than indoors. Aim for at least an hour a day, ideally combining it with something enjoyable: a walk, a coffee in the park or a kick-about with friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plan winter pleasures: &lt;/strong&gt;Reframe thoughts such as “I hate winter” into “winter is harder, but I can plan around it”. Embrace cosy rituals, such as candles, hot chocolate or warm baths and schedule social or outdoor activities, such as cold-water dips or winter hikes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;
  &lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know when to seek help: &lt;/strong&gt;If mood, sleep or motivation problems persist for weeks or interfere with daily life, speak to a GP or mental health professional. Sad is treatable.&lt;/p&gt;

In contrast, the more limited cognitive challenges found in children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) who do not have learning difficulties may be consequences of their inattention and hyperactivity. The research was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10870547251376776" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Journal of Attention Disorders&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children with ADHD and those with specific learning difficulties often exhibit overlapping challenges with attention and certain thinking skills. This has led researchers to question the nature of this relationship: Are the difficulties with memory and processing simply a side effect of being inattentive or hyperactive? A team of researchers sought to disentangle these factors to better understand the underlying cognitive profiles of these distinct but frequently co-occurring conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While there have been previous studies that examined the link between ADHD symptoms and learning or cognitive skills in groups of children with ADHD or learning difficulties, there has been no study that examined how ADHD symptoms influence cognitive skills that are key to learning in these neurodivergent groups,” said study author Yufei Cai, a PhD researcher in the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Cambridge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding how ADHD attentional behaviors influence these cognitive skills that are essential for successful learning in these neurodivergent populations can offer suggestions for designing interventions that might improve cognitive or learning functioning in these neurodivergent groups.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate, the researchers performed a detailed analysis of existing data from the Centre for Attention, Learning, and Memory, a large cohort of children referred for concerns related to attention, memory, or learning. They selected data from 770 children, aged 5 to 18, and organized them into four distinct groups. These groups included children with a diagnosis of ADHD only, children with learning difficulties only, children with both ADHD and learning difficulties, and a comparison group of children with no known neurodevelopmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each child had completed a broad range of standardized tests. These assessments measured fundamental cognitive skills such as verbal and visuospatial short-term memory, working memory (the ability to hold and manipulate information temporarily), processing speed, and sustained attention. Higher-level executive functions, like the ability to flexibly shift between different tasks or rules, were also evaluated. Alongside these direct assessments, parents provided ratings of their child’s daily behaviors related to inattention and hyperactivity or impulsivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study is the first to date that has (1) a relatively large neurodivergent sample size, (2) a comprehensive battery of cognitive and learning measures, and (3) the inclusion of a co-occurring condition group of those with both ADHD and learning difficulties to examine the extent to which elevated scores of ADHD symptoms can account for the group differences in cognitive skills that are key to learning between these neurodivergent and comparison groups,” Cai told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study aims to characterize the cognitive profiles of these three neurodivergent groups, as well as examine the associations between ADHD symptoms (i.e., inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive behaviors) and cognitive skills that are key to learning in children with ADHD, learning difficulties, and those with both conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The core of the analysis involved a two-step comparison. First, the researchers compared the performance of the four groups across all the cognitive tests to identify where differences existed. Next, they applied a statistical approach to see what would happen to these differences if they mathematically adjusted for each child’s level of parent-rated inattention and hyperactivity. If a group’s cognitive weakness disappeared after this adjustment, it would suggest the cognitive issue might be a consequence of attentional behaviors. If the weakness remained, it would point to a more fundamental cognitive deficit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results revealed a clear divergence between the groups. Children with learning difficulties, both with and without a co-occurring ADHD diagnosis, displayed a broad pattern of lower performance across many cognitive domains. They showed weaknesses in short-term memory, working memory, processing speed, sustained attention, and the ability to sequence information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers statistically accounted for levels of inattention and hyperactivity, these cognitive deficits largely persisted. This outcome suggests that for children with learning difficulties, these cognitive challenges are likely foundational to their condition, not just a byproduct of attentional issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The profile for children with ADHD only was quite different. This group performed at age-appropriate levels on many of the cognitive tasks, including verbal short-term memory, working memory, processing speed, and sustained attention. They did show some specific difficulties, particularly in visuospatial short-term memory and the ability to quickly sequence numbers or letters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these particular challenges were no longer apparent after the statistical analysis adjusted for their levels of inattention and hyperactivity. This finding indicates that for these children, their attentional behaviors may directly interfere with performance on certain cognitive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One specific challenge did appear to be independent of attentional behaviors for the ADHD only group. Their difficulty with set shifting, or mentally switching between different task rules, remained even after accounting for inattention and hyperactivity. This points to a more specific executive function challenge in ADHD that may not be fully explained by its primary behavioral symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the findings paint a picture of two different neurodevelopmental pathways. For children with learning difficulties, core cognitive weaknesses appear to drive their academic struggles. For many children with ADHD alone, their primary attentional challenges may be what creates more limited and specific hurdles in their cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Children with learning difficulties, either with or without ADHD, had lower levels of cognitive skills than children with ADHD without co-occurring learning difficulties and those in the comparison group,” Cai explained. “Elevated levels of inattention and hyperactive/impulsive behaviors did not influence the low cognitive performance observed in these children. Instead, this lower cognitive performance may be more closely associated with their learning ability, which is central to their neurodevelopmental characteristics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, these attentional behaviors are closely linked to the more limited cognitive challenges observed in children with ADHD without co-occurring learning difficulties. Understanding whether neurodivergent children with ADHD, learning difficulties, or both experience cognitive or learning-related challenges provides a valuable framework for designing targeted intervention and support strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as with all research, the study includes some limitations. The group with learning difficulties was identified based on low scores on academic tests rather than formal clinical diagnoses of conditions like dyslexia or dyscalculia, which might not be perfectly equivalent. The study’s design provides a snapshot at a single point in time, so it cannot capture how these relationships might evolve as children develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could build on these findings by following children over several years to observe these developmental trajectories directly. Incorporating a wider array of cognitive measures and gathering behavioral information from multiple sources, including teachers, could also help create an even more detailed understanding. Such work could help refine support strategies, ensuring that interventions are targeted to a child’s specific profile of cognitive and behavioral needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10870547251376776" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Associations Between ADHD Symptom Dimensions and Cognition in Children With ADHD and Learning Difficulties&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Yufei Cai, Joni Holmes, and Susan E.

&lt;p&gt;All this talk of shortfalls might leave you wondering if it’s at all possible to keep yourself well nourished these days. But if you’re reaching for a bottle of multivitamins right to supplement the gaps, you may want to slow your roll, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registered dietician nutritionist &lt;a href="https://www.mpmnutrition.com/about" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7965912" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Marissa Karp&lt;/a&gt; had this advice: “While supplements can help us bridge the gap and serve as an insurance policy, they aren’t a replacement for eating nourishing foods. If you aren’t already eating well, moving your body, drinking water and managing your stress, don’t waste money on supplements. Taking supplements and then eating processed foods is not the same as eating a whole foods diet and using supplements to help ensure you’re getting enough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She offered this example of the joy of whole foods: “When you eat an avocado, it’s not just about the potassium or dietary fiber, but the synergy of the nutrients working together. It’s how the fat and fiber in the avocado slow down your gastric emptying and help keep you fuller longer. It’s also about how satisfying it tastes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying well-nourished is much simpler than you might think, Walker said. “We don’t need extreme diets or supplements to fill these nutrient gaps, but simple, intentional dietary shifts that can make a significant impact. By increasing whole foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts, seeds, dairy and lean proteins, you can improve your intake of these critical shortfall nutrients, leading to better long-term health and disease prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/shortfall-nutrients_l_67e43ec0e4b0e572f646b037" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7965912"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HuffPost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It became the first fully synthetic molecule to be considered a drug after scientists discovered it could be used to treat some diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most famously, the German immunologist Paul Ehrlich experimented with methylene blue and found that it could treat malaria in sailors. Ehrlich coined the concept of the “magic bullet” — the idea that if you could find a chemical that binds to a certain bacteria or virus but not the rest of the tissue, it could help target diseases. He went on to do notable work in syphilis and chemotherapy, and his career was documented and dramatized in the 1940 film, “Dr. Ehrlich’s Magic Bullet,” starring Edward G. Robinson. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He is absolutely the history of methylene blue,” said Gordon Lithgow of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, who studies molecules that extend lifespan. “That (magic bullet) principle still drives pharmacology culture today. We’re looking for specific agents that bind to one thing and don’t affect other stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the decades, methylene blue has been used as a staining compound in labs because it helps visualize the presence of certain materials in cells and track their rate of movement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT1" data-large-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh300px lg:ais"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, methylene blue is FDA-approved to treat just one medical condition, methemoglobinemia, a rare disorder that affects how red blood cells function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How the hype began&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did it go from a dye and staining compound to a buzzed-about anti-aging supplement? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not entirely clear, but a few things have happened recently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Nir Barzilai, a well-known longevity researcher at Albert Einstein College of Medicine who studies centenarians, &lt;a href="https://montefioreeinstein.org/news/2024/03/11/evaluating-possible-anti-aging-drugs" data-link="native" class=""&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://esmed.org/MRA/mra/article/view/5138/99193547794" data-link="native" class=""&gt;ranking&lt;/a&gt; of 12 FDA-approved drugs that he and his research team consider worth studying for anti-aging potential, based on pre-clinical and clinical studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="B300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top four drugs are SLGT2 inhibitors (a Type 2 diabetes drug), metformin (also a diabetes drug), biphosphonates (which treat osteoporosis and some cancers) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (which treat diabetes and obesity, and include Ozempic). Lower down on the list is methylene blue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, Mel Gibson did an interview on Joe Rogan’s podcast during which he said methylene blue and the antiparasitic ivermectin helped cure three of his friends’ cancer — remarks that were countered by medical experts for lack of scientific evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, a video of RFK Jr., putting blue drops into a glass of water went viral on X. Many speculated it was methylene blue, though that was not confirmed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, Bryan Johnson, a biohacker who injected plasma from his son as part of an anti-aging regimen, tweeted that &lt;a href="https://x.com/bryan_johnson/status/1896679614602482042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1896679614602482042%7Ctwgr%5E05afb6eaa33ba75e55b3e1d1a2737cf026231733%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2Flifestyle%2Fbryan-johnson-mel-gibson-possibly-200842038.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;he was starting methylene blue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, there’s been a surge of social media chatter about methylene blue, with many people posting Instagram and TikTok videos of their blue tongues — methylene blue can temporarily turn your tongue and urine blue — and saying it helps with mood, focus, energy and cognitive function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh300px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The mitochondria connection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason methylene blue is being explored as a potential anti-aging compound is because of its connection to mitochondrial function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria are part of the cell that produces energy. Loss of mitochondrial function, due to oxidative stress increasing over time, is a hallmark of aging, said Michael Snyder, a professor of genetics at Stanford who researches longevity. Methylene blue has antioxidant properties that can help lower oxidative stress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with mitochondrial dysfunction get a lot of fatigue, he said, and loss of mitochondrial function has been observed in many diseases including chronic fatigue syndrome, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One 2021 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8699482/" data-link="native" class=""&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; of studies on the anti-aging potential of methylene blue found that low doses of the compound improved oxidative stress, cognitive defects and memory in mice. It may also help with skin aging by stimulating elastin and collagen and promoting wound healing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="S300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Science still lacking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, researchers say the science is a ways away from being able to recommend methylene blue for off-label use, as there haven’t been enough studies in humans to determine its long-term effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m not ready to take it myself,” Snyder said. “I don’t know anything about the long-term effects.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way longevity drugs tend to get developed, he said, is that researchers start with a drug that’s already been proven to be effective at treating specific conditions, like metformin or GLP-1 drugs. As studies continue, they find there are other benefits, such as weight loss. Metformin, for instance, has been widely prescribed for diabetes for decades, but researchers more recently found that it also has antioxidant properties, which could make it useful as a longevity drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s been widely used and we know a lot about it and the side effects,” Snyder said of metformin. “I don’t know that you can say the same for methylene blue just yet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lithgow, of the Buck Institute, cautioned people to “be really careful, especially when using synthetic molecules to affect something in your body without appropriate supervision.

The study authors shared, “Most microbiome studies only consider current medications, but our results show that past drug use can be just as important.” If you have been on multiple drugs for long-term, consider your gut as a part of your care plan.

&lt;p&gt;Older people who listen to music often slash their risk of dementia by more than a third, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers studied people over the age of 70 and found that listening to music—or playing an instrument—is linked to a reduction of up to 39% in the chances of developing the debilitating condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increases in life expectancy due to advances in medicine and technology have seen a rise in the prevalence of age‐related diseases, including dementia and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study, involving more than 10,800 older people, looked at the benefits of listening to or playing music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings showed that always listening to music—compared with never, rarely, or sometimes doing so—was associated with a 39% decreased risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playing an instrument was associated with a 35% reduction in dementia risk, according to&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gps.70163" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; the study published&lt;/a&gt; in the International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always listening to music was also associated with a 17% lower incidence of cognitive impairment, as well as higher scores in overall cognition and ‘episodic memory’, which is used when recalling everyday events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regularly engaging in both listening to and playing music was associated with a 33% decreased risk of dementia and 22% decreased risk of cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Evidence suggests that brain aging is not just based on age and genetics but can be influenced by one’s own environmental and lifestyle choices,” &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1102855" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said the study’s senior author&lt;/a&gt; Professor Joanne Ryan of Monash University in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“With no cure currently available for dementia, the importance of identifying strategies to help prevent or delay onset of the disease is critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our study suggests that lifestyle-based interventions, such as listening and/or playing music can promote cognitive health,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results are promising, though “causation cannot be established,” suggested study co-author Emma Jaffa.&lt;/p&gt;

The asparagus plant produces &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S003194221300352X?via=ihub" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;a compound called the asparagusic acid&lt;/a&gt; and, when it's digested by your body, it releases sulphur compounds too. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/533914" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;It's these chemicals&lt;/a&gt;, such as methanethiol and dimethyl sulphide, that make your sweat and your pee smell a certain way. Sulphur compounds are very volatile, so they easily disperse in the air. That's why they're so easy to smell from the toilet bowl. This smell usually lasts &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/psp4.12264" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;more than five hours&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Not everybody produces this smell, although studies about this &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20140818-mystery-of-asparagus-and-urine" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;keep &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20140818-mystery-of-asparagus-and-urine" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;coming up with different findings&lt;/a&gt;. In the 1950s, research seemed to suggest that fewer than 50% of people produce the tell-tale asparagus pee odour, while in 2010, researchers found more than 90% of test participants did. So it’s not clear cut. And not everybody can perceive the stink: the ability to smell one's pungent &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article/36/1/9/442551?login=false" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;asparagus-smelling pee seems to be down to genetics&lt;/a&gt; too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;However, when it comes to fruit and vegetables more widely, eating more of them can lead to a more attractive scent. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513816301933" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;A 2017 study in Australia&lt;/a&gt; found that men who had consumed more fruit and vegetables were significantly associated with smelling better – more fruity, floral and sweet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The study also notes, interestingly, when people have to rate people's faces, slightly yellower skin rich in carotenoid – a molecule from carrots, pumpkins, tomatoes and papayas and others – is also found to be more attractive. But the same study suggests that people consuming diets with a little bit of fat, meat, egg, and tofu intake were also associated with more pleasant-smelling sweat. Carb-heavy diets produced the least sexy of scents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;&lt;span id="meat-and-fish" class="sc-d16436d-0 gCPVhV"&gt;&lt;b id="meat-and-fish" class="sc-d16436d-0 gnUCoQ"&gt;Meat and fish&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Meat and fish can also produce a distinct body odour as animal proteins are broken down by the body into amino acids and fats, which are then excreted through sweat – where they interact with skin bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxNakprX2xSVmdrUVR3Z21GWnRiRnFhS2Q0YW90Q3IzVW03NUk1U3lfQkdFanVSNG5mZTA4SHRLVDlHcm1RMkNVcXhDcEJBbHJsYm9lZi1BRDF6Mk93TDJza0cwU20ycGtmVWQtQnZxYnpBVUdlbFlmZkpXanpBcDRjYTkwa0lDekhYcFZYUHRzazcxSXc</guid></item><item><title>以下是您应该（或不应该）在全身冰浴中浸泡的原因-有线</title><link>https://www.wired.com/story/is-cold-plunging-good-for-you/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="lead-in-text-callout"&gt;Cold plunging at&lt;/span&gt; the gym or having a chilly shower at home has become a popular practice in recent years. But is all the self-inflicted freezing really that good for you? With the promise of boosting your mood, providing mental clarity, and reducing muscle soreness post-workout, it may sound enticing, but it’s not for everyone. Aside from making your teeth chatter, there are the notable negatives as well as its positives to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Tasked with the challenge of testing the &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/best-cold-plunge-tubs/" target="_blank"&gt;latest cold-plunge pools&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, I reluctantly jumped on the bandwagon.

If you don’t have a gym membership and don’t fancy stripping down to your bathing suit at the local lake, an indoor bathtub filled with icy cold water will do. “You don’t need an expensive set up,” says Brecka. “A bathtub with ice works. A horse trough in the backyard works. Dedicated plunge pools are convenient, but you’ll get benefits no matter how you create cold exposure. It’s consistency that matters more than equipment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;So how long do you cold plunge and what temperature should a cold plunge be? Brecka suggests two to six minutes as the ideal time. It’s long enough to activate the nervous system and short enough to stay safe.

Brecka suggests persevering for maximum benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“We do a plunge because cold exposure activates your nervous system, improves circulation, and helps your body adapt to stress,” he says. “Cold plunging is not about powering through the shock, it’s about letting that shock drive physiological change.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Some studies show benefits for cold plunging, including from &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/research-highlights-health-benefits-from-cold-water-immersions?" target="_blank"&gt;Harvard Medical School&lt;/a&gt;.

This shows that even remote, relatively pristine environments are not immune to the effects of human activity, such as planet-heating pollution on fish migration and microplastics in the Himalayas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why are insect populations important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Insects are among the most essential and overlooked organisms on Earth.

(Russ Dillingham/Staff Photographer)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What should I do if I hear about parvovirus cases near me?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Parvovirus is a highly contagious, often deadly virus that has been reported among dogs in Androscoggin, Penobscot and &lt;a href="https://www.sunjournal.com/2025/10/22/parvo-alert-issued-in-mexico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Oxford counties&lt;/a&gt;, plus other communities across Maine. If you hear of cases in your area, avoid taking your dog to a dog park or other public places where pets gather. The best protection against parvovirus is to get your dog vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Is the rabies vaccine required for Maine’s pets?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. Dogs and cats that are 3 months or older are required by Maine law to be vaccinated against rabies, but state officials strongly recommend the vaccine for other animals such as ferrets, horses and livestock. Rabies is almost always fatal and is carried by common wildlife animals in Maine, including raccoons, skunks, bats and foxes.&lt;/p&gt;


	
	


&lt;p&gt;“That’s the no-brainer,” David Cloutier, board president of the Maine Veterinary Medical Association, said of the rabies vaccine. “Just do it. They are incredibly effective and we see almost no reaction.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What vaccines are recommended for dogs?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Core vaccines are recommended for all dogs, regardless of lifestyle. They include vaccines for rabies, leptospirosis and a combination vaccine for several contagious and potentially deadly viral infections, according to American Animal Hospital Association guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The combination distemper vaccine, known as a DAPP or DHPP vaccine, is a three-dose shot recommended 6-8 weeks after birth that protects against canine distemper virus, two types of adenovirus, parvovirus and parainfluenza. The vaccine for leptospirosis can be included in the combination distemper or administered separately.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Maine, tick-related vaccines are considered core by most experts, Cloutier said. “If you live in a place like Maine with a lot of ticks, it makes sense,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;For cats?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cats are recommended to get the rabies vaccine at around 4 months. While vaccine types and schedules differ, cats are recommended to get core vaccines that protect against feline leukemia, panleukopenia, herpes virus and calicivirus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How often should my pet get a booster?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dogs and cats should both get a rabies booster one year after their first dose, then every three years after that. The canine distemper vaccine follows the same schedule.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Are vaccines bad for my pet?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No. Vaccines have been proven to be a safe and effective way to prevent life-threatening diseases in animals. Some pets may experience mild, temporary side effects, but experts say the benefits of vaccinating against dangerous illnesses far outweigh any risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Can viruses or diseases be transmitted between humans and pets?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. Rabies can be transmitted from animals to humans through bites or scratches. Leptospirosis, which can cause kidney damage, liver failure and death in humans, is spread through contact with the urine of infected animals, usually found in contaminated water or soil.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What if I can’t pay for a vaccine or veterinary care?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many shelters and humane societies in Maine hold vaccination clinics at a low cost, including Bangor Humane Shelter, Greater Androscoggin Humane Society in Lewiston and Midcoast Humane in Brunswick. There are also vaccination clinics at several Petco and Tractor Supply Co. stores across Maine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Clinics are a low-cost, easily accessible way to get vaccines, Cloutier said. You don’t even need a relationship with a veterinarian.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’ll vaccinate them right on the bed of the truck, no questions asked, $10 a piece,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccination is the most cost-effective way to keep veterinary costs low. The canine distemper combination vaccine costs between $20 and $100, while experts say treatment for parvovirus can cost thousands.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Potential pet owners should consider whether they can afford vaccination and veterinary care before adopting a pet.&lt;/p&gt;

Turns out, women may gain the same level of heart protection as men with nearly half the amount of activity as men. The study examined wearable device data from around 85,000 adults.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women who exercised for almost 250 minutes a week, which is approximately 35 minutes a day, showed a 30 percent lower risk of developing heart disease. But here's the difference. For men to achieve the same heart protection from exercise of 30 percent lower risk, they need to do exercises for around 530 minutes a week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is not solely for preventing heart diseases, but also the same is applicable for mitigating heart disease complications as well. Women with heart disease who met the recommended activity levels gained the advantage of a whopping 70 percent lower death reduction, compared to those women who stayed inactive. But when men did the same amount and duration of exercise, their risk reduction was only around 19 percent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It sheds light on the global recommended activity levels, which are often general and not sex specific. The same 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity per week is relevant for everyone, despite gender. But this study serves as an eye-opener, suggesting that exercise's benefits are effective not based on how long one works out but on how the body responds to the activity. This is particularly critical as men and women have greatly different biological responses and systems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why do women's bodies respond differently?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/10/08/original/1049_1759934877054.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Muscle type and hormones help women gain better heart health benefits.

(Picture credit: Freepik)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Muscle type and hormones help women gain better heart health benefits. (Picture credit: Freepik)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reason why women have an extra advantage here is due to the hormones and muscle composition. Estrogen, which is a sex hormone, is more common in women, causes fat metabolism when one is exercising. This is essentially an energy process where the body uses fat as fuel during exercise rather than relying on sugar. When fat for energy is used, it puts less pressure on the heart. This is why women have better heart health with less activity. Women also have more endurance-oriented muscle fibres (type I), unlike men, who have more power-oriented muscle fibres (type II).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All these biological variations make it possible for women to reap better rewards for cardiovascular health.

Nutritionist Suman Agarwal, certified from Oxford University, in an Instagram post shared on October 31, listed 5 things people should do immediately to safeguard themselves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5 things to safeguard yourself from breast cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listing the 5 precautionary measures, the nutritionist wrote, “If you don't want your wife, your mother, or your sister to suffer from breast cancer, these are the five things you must do immediately.” Here's what she recommends:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Move daily and get your morning sun&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calling it the ‘most important step’, the nutritionist recommends daily movement and getting your dose of morning sun. “If you don't get enough oxygen in ways of exercise, you must move daily. Whether it is walking, jogging, paddling, pickleball, cycling, swimming, or any form of exercise is great,” she stressed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Increase your protein intake&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the nutritionist suggests increasing protein intake in your diet. She stresses that protein deficiency is a very big problem. It is not just for muscle building, it is vital for antibodies and repairing tissues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Your immune system relies on protein to defend against harmful bacteria and invaders, including cancer cells,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/11/02/original/breast_cancer_prevention_1762066896729.png" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="5 breast cancer prevention tips.

(Google Gemini)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Avoid sugar&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As you know, food for cancer is sugar. So what you must avoid is junk food, desserts, ice cream, chocolates, aerated drinks, alcohol, and mithai (sweets). You don't have to completely avoid this food. You can have them, but only on occasions,” she warned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Manage your stress and your sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the nutritionist highlighted the importance of managing stress and sleep. She stated, “Chronic stress is one of the biggest reasons for disrupting your hormonal balance and suppressing your immune system.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is why long-standing sleep deprivation weakens your immune system and increases the risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Monthly check-ups&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Last, but most important, I recommend everyone to do monthly checks of their breast and visit their gynaecologist on a yearly basis for screening,” the nutritionist stressed. Early detection of cancer can save your loved ones' lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

&lt;p id="2d2ba70a-8a19-483f-9049-5450feb966b1"&gt;There’s something special about fitness instructors who understand the needs and challenges of people with limited mobility—yoga teacher &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.michellekellyyoga.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.michellekellyyoga.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Michelle Kelly&lt;/a&gt; is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Kelly had a bike accident and broke her pelvis in three places and her collarbone. After taking a break from teaching until she could walk again, she returned with a new focus and launched a chair yoga class called Active &amp;amp; Able.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="2d2ba70a-8a19-483f-9049-5450feb966b1-2"&gt;Kelly was already offering accessible yoga in 2020 during the pandemic after realizing older family members had stopped exercising. When she returned to teaching, she used some of these moves with a renewed appreciation for aids, especially the chair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My accident was at the end of May 2024, and I began teaching the chair yoga class mid-July 2024,” says Kelly. “It was the only one I taught for a month. By using the aids I had, I was able to truly get an understanding of what people with mobility issues need.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When using a chair, movements can be made easier by eliminating some of our body weight,” she explains. “Standing behind a chair and using it as an aid when balancing is a great way to begin strengthening your ankles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A chair can also be used to build up to harder poses if you have limited mobility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can make movements a bit easier, then depend less on the chair as strength and range of motion improve,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qtePMNzWkRE4m33iPC9tJ3" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qtePMNzWkRE4m33iPC9tJ3 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Standing for long periods of time can be difficult for some, so being able to sit and still move your body is a huge plus, especially if someone lacks the confidence to get up and down off the floor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you struggle with your mobility, want to improve your balance and posture or want some variety in your regular practice, try Kelly’s five-move chair-supported sequence below.

Renowned cardiologist Dr. Aseem Malhotra, along with an award-winning health campaigner, developed a science-backed approach based on lifestyle changes that support cardiovascular health without any medication. In the Ultimate Human Podcast with Gary Brecka, Dr. Malhotra shares how heart health can improve drastically within 21 days if a person follows the steps outlined below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The motivation behind this approach&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Malhotra's journey within the NHS began when he faced a concerning paradox: patients admitted with heart attacks were being served unhealthy hospital food, while he performed emergency procedures. This sparked his lifelong commitment to advocating for nutrition and lifestyle as foundational to heart health. In a 2013 BBC article, Dr. Malhotra said, "I mend hearts. Then I see my patients served junk food by our hospitals." This troubling trend persists worldwide, which explains why heart disease is still on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Why are women more at risk for heart disease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He emphasizes that modern medicine has often overlooked the simple power of foods, exercise, stress management, and sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While medications such as statins are widely prescribed, Dr. Malhotra notes their benefits are marginal compared to lifestyle changes, which can rapidly improve heart health and overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The 21-day heart health reset&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Malhotra's 21-day solution provides actionable, sustainable steps to reset your metabolism, reduce inflammation, and protect your arteries. The core principle is adopting a low-carbohydrate Mediterranean-style diet focused on whole, minimally processed foods: vegetables, nuts, seeds, virgin olive oil, and lean proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He advises avoiding sugar, refined carbohydrates, fruit juices, and ultra-processed foods for at least three weeks. This phase helps stabilize blood sugar, lower triglycerides, and improve insulin sensitivity—all key factors in reducing cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Motion and exercise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity is another pillar of the reset. Dr. Malhotra recommends a daily brisk walk of 30 minutes. The goal is consistent movement, not extreme gym workouts. Regular walking improves blood flow, aids weight control, and enhances heart and lung function, forming a foundation for cardiovascular longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Meditation for reducing stress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress is a major contributor to heart disease, and meditation, especially Rajyoga meditation, plays a vital role. Studies suggest it may even reverse artery blockages by reducing inflammation and calming the nervous system. Spending time each day on mindful breathing limits stress hormones that damage blood vessels, helping prevent heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sleep and quality recovery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is often underestimated but crucial for heart health. Dr. Malhotra recommends 7–8 hours of quality sleep each night. Proper rest regulates blood pressure and inflammation, aiding the repair and maintenance of the cardiovascular system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Beyond diet and exercise: Building a healthy environment and habits&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While personal responsibility is important, Dr. Malhotra stresses the need for an environment that supports healthy choices. Junk food marketing and the easy availability of processed meals often work against individuals. He advocates for systemic change alongside individual lifestyle shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also notes that approximately 67% of what many people consume daily falls into the highly processed category, which typically contains additives, preservatives, colorings, and flavor enhancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thumb rule to check processed foods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a product has more than five ingredients, it is likely ultra-processed and best avoided. Dr. Malhotra emphasizes that mounting scientific evidence links an ultra-processed diet to increased risk of diseases such as cancer, depression, and overall mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Scientific evidence and impact&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Malhotra’s approach is grounded in research. Meta-analyses and clinical trials confirm that reducing carbohydrate intake, cutting sugar, and adopting a Mediterranean diet significantly lowers heart disease risk markers within weeks. Stress reduction techniques also have anti-inflammatory and cardiovascular benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He further notes that cholesterol alone is an incomplete marker of heart disease risk. Insulin resistance, triglycerides, inflammation, and lifestyle factors are stronger predictors—and all are modifiable through diet and lifestyle changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tips to get started today&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eat real food: Fill your plate with vegetables, healthy fats such as olive oil and nuts, and moderate protein. Avoid sugary drinks, sweets, and processed snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daily walk: Aim for a brisk 30-minute walk every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meditate: Spend 20–40 minutes a day practicing focused breathing or Rajyoga meditation to calm the mind and heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep well: Maintain a pattern that allows 7–8 hours of quality sleep each night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Aseem Malhotra’s message is one of hope and empowerment: heart health is not about pills or procedures. It’s about embracing a lifestyle that allows your body to heal and function as it was designed to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 02 Nov 2025 03:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihgJBVV95cUxObk9IWnBKbkNVQ05XMHdSQnV3NUN5c1ZoRm1oLWNrUmZ3cXRTTTZNa0tVd1RaX0N1Y3hiNVRFTF82WlZPRWN1dV84Qkw1QVRpb2FlWjM5MEJodHh2TTdIQVUxTW1wY1BXTXZWX2paNnBVM2NkdjB1dDdvUktZMTVVaTJZWW5nTjhGXzZ1cHc3UGctdTNpaU9NdGNYSVNEa1FFUnl2dlJtRDU3NTQ4Z3pGWC0wT3oyY0d4Y2hvSEQzRWtrWXdmaGZxaE9mZVJCakszUnVCcXRsdEtfN2RoZ2dGb0Fqcjh4Y3MwTElkV3E5QWUtSkVoazRhWmZFcTRqZjFKWkdmV1p3</guid></item><item><title>我是一名传染病医生。以下是当我在飞机上坐在怀疑接种疫苗的人旁边时发生的事情。- Yahoo News UK</title><link>https://uk.news.yahoo.com/im-infectious-disease-doctor-heres-023104848.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It’s hard to believe that infectious diseases have become a political litmus test, but they are now very much part of the “with us or against us” mental sorting more and more people seem to be doing these days.

I just wish I knew the magic words to reach people willing to jettison decades of evidence and research for something they read online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I am proud of my work and committed to my profession.

Despite the early hour and lack of sleep, with no viable exit option, I decided to face the challenge, though I braced for the worst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Lyme disease was first on the list. We were flying out of Connecticut, after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“You’ve never heard that Lyme disease was created as a bioterrorism weapon?” I had not (because &lt;a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/21681" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:it wasn’t;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;it wasn’t&lt;/a&gt;). Somehow, in between the hours caring for patients, researching disease pathogenesis and staying up to date on the literature in my field, I had missed this infectious disease conspiracy du jour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s called Lyme because that’s where they released it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;No. Old Lyme, Connecticut, is where epidemiologists realized that patients’ symptoms coincided with recent tick bites and then confirmed that local ticks carried the disease-causing bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“You can’t cure it; it was made to weaponize.” Actually, we have very &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/hcp/clinical-care/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:effective antibiotics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;effective antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; to kill the bacteria (though some people can develop a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/signs-symptoms/chronic-symptoms-and-lyme-disease.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:complex post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;complex post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome&lt;/a&gt;). I’m not a military strategist, but I can’t imagine that indiscriminately infecting outdoor enthusiasts with a non-deadly, treatable disease that requires transmission via a slow-feeding arthropod would be an ideal bioterrorism plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“But why is it spreading so fast now?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Climate change, expanding tick habitats and food sources, and a lack of winters that kill them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;He laughed. “So in your ‘profesh’ opinion, Lyme disease as a bioterrorism weapon is a bunch of horseshit?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Yes. That I do agree with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;We moved on to the next obvious infectious disease topic: COVID-19. I gave him space. He wasn’t sparring with a lack of respect, nor was I. We opened up about experiencing the pandemic in completely different ways. He described how hard it was being forced to get vaccinated, feeling coerced to keep his job but fearing the vaccine’s purported harms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I shared my experience working in the hospital. I told him how I had witnessed numerous people die alone, and how the vaccine was a true savior. He believed it was only old people who had died. I told him I had seen enough young, healthy people become debilitated that I would never make that bet, not in that pandemic or the next one. In fact, by September 2023, &lt;a href="https://data.cdc.gov/National-Center-for-Health-Statistics/Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-by-Sex-and-Age/9bhg-hcku/data_preview" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:more than 25,000 18-39-year-olds had died from COVID in the U.S.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;more than 25,000 18-39-year-olds had died from COVID in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I tried to hear his concerns. I admitted that my passion for science and what I had experienced as a physician may have made me unfairly dismissive of people whose primary concerns were being stuck at home unable to pay rent or educate their children. I acknowledged that there’s always a small chance that some people might experience an adverse reaction to any medical intervention, be it a vaccine or over-the-counter drug, and I can understand why that makes some people hesitate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But I also reiterated the rigor of the scientific process involved in developing treatments, reviewing safety data, and ultimately making clinical recommendations. I told him that mRNA vaccines are neither new — &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/diseases-conditions/decades-making-mrna-covid-19-vaccines" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:they’ve been in development for decades;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;they’ve been in development for decades&lt;/a&gt; — nor a government-led conspiracy to genetically manipulate the population. The reference to “genetic material” may lead to misconceptions, but mRNA does not enter the cell nucleus, where our DNA resides. Our cells do not even possess the molecular machinery capable of turning mRNA into DNA. That’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/how-they-work.html#:~:text=How%20mRNA%20COVID%2D19%20vaccines%20work" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fact;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;fact&lt;/a&gt;, not just my “profesh” opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It felt real, the effort to hear and speak to each other. And I learned things from him, too. In response to my insistence that his infection-related conspiracy theories were nothing but that, he admitted, “Yeah, you’re probably right.” Then he added, with a smile on his face, “But conspiracies are a lot more fun.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conspiracies are a lot more fun&lt;/em&gt;. Maybe vaccine or disease origin conspiracies are fun — if you’re young and healthy, if you’re bored, if you’re motivated to access a community that promises you “inside information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But for the population as a whole, they are unbelievably dangerous. Conspiracy theories are why a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/health/measles-texas-kennedy-fox.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:measles outbreak took hold in the U.S. this year;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;measles outbreak took hold in the U.S. this year&lt;/a&gt;, why &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/09/us/gunman-cdc-shooting-vaccines.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CDC employees were targeted in a workplace shooting;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;CDC employees were targeted in a workplace shooting&lt;/a&gt;.

The experience left me with genuine hope that we could maintain trust in each other and reminded me that scientists and physicians cannot give up on having these conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“With COVID, vaccines, Lyme disease, any of it — I’m not your enemy,” I told my seatmate as we were getting ready to disembark. “And I know you’re not the enemy, either.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“True,” he agreed. “But they always want to make someone your enemy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exactly&lt;/em&gt;. That is what conspiracy theories require. That is why we have to talk to each other. See me as a person. And I will do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;I am not your enemy.

observed, the study, published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935125014835?via%3Dihub" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Environmental Research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Environmental Research&lt;/a&gt;, found that long-term exposure to sulfur dioxide — a pollutant released during the combustion of oil and gas and during mining activity — increases the risk of developing ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;At an ALS clinic in New Brunswick, Canada, doctors noticed a spike in cases. In response, lead author Daniel Saucier launched a study comparing 304 individuals with the disease to 1,207 healthy individuals, all of the same age and sex. The research used records of environmental pollutants connected to the participants' areas of residence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Saucier, who holds a master's degree in diagnostic methods for ALS, told ABC that "it looked like air pollution was potentially related to the increased cases of ALS in New Brunswick, with sulfur dioxide appearing to be the one that had a significant association of ALS."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study found that people exposed to sulfur dioxide over long periods had a 23% higher risk of developing ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to Saucier, while burning dirty fuels releases sulfur dioxide, so does "anything that has to do with mining activities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;All study areas met Canada's &lt;a href="https://ccme.ca/en/air-quality-report" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:clean air guidelines;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;clean air guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, yet the research identified a significant health association between sulfur dioxide exposure and ALS risk. The authors concluded that preventive strategies will be needed to protect public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is air pollution concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Harmful pollutants such as sulfur dioxide are released during the extraction and use of coal, oil, and gas. While these fuels remain central to global energy production, their by-products pose serious risks to workers, communities, and the environment, especially in industrial zones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Beyond sulfur dioxide, many other industrial carbon pollutants contribute to rising global temperatures. A warmer planet intensifies natural disasters, sea-level rise, and other health impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What can be done about air pollution?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;With new technologies emerging that reduce or eliminate the need to mine and burn dirty fuels, many workplace and public safety concerns can be avoided. For example, &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/install-solar-panels/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:solar panels;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;solar panels&lt;/a&gt; generate electricity without releasing harmful pollutants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Additionally, rising health concerns from exposure to pollution drive a growing demand for cleaner energy. Advocating for solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear energy shows policymakers that the public truly cares about these issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Cleaner energy is also becoming increasingly popular and more affordable. A LUT University study concluded that a complete transition is &lt;a href="https://www.lut.fi/en/news/researchers-agree-world-can-reach-100-renewable-energy-system-2050" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:feasible;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;feasible&lt;/a&gt; and could occur before 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As the world relies more on renewable energy sources, health risks will decrease as heat-trapping pollutants are reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Smaller steps, such as reducing your environmental footprint, are also a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Switching from gas-guzzling cars to electric vehicles, turning off lights and appliances when not in use, and eating more plant-based meals are all helpful lifestyle changes that can reduce pollution and the demand for dirty fuels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/tech-newsletter/?rec0rX1mps1JFgqJm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt;

But it soon began appearing online under a new name, Atom, in near-identical packaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;A law was recently passed allowing authorities to block websites selling "unregistered dietary supplements" without a court order - but sellers have been getting around this by categorising them as "sports nutrition" instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;On TikTok, you can find retailers selling Molecule under listings that look like they are for muesli, biscuits and even lightbulbs. And some retailers aren't even trying to hide it any more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;A few weeks ago, the BBC found Molecule listings on a popular Russian online marketplace. When approached for comment, the site said it had promptly removed any products containing sibutramine.

Others claim to be sourcing the pills from Germany.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Some packets state they were produced in Remagen in Germany - but the BBC has discovered there is no such company listed at the address given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Certain Kazakh vendors selling Molecule to Russians told the BBC they bought stock from friends or warehouses in the capital Astana but couldn't name the original supplier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 diUlgm"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 cRgahm"&gt;&lt;i id="details-of-support-with-eating-disorders-in-the-uk-are-available-at" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;Details of support with eating disorders in the UK are available at &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2DRkg4JC7SLT3B7hlrn6DKN/information-and-support-eating-disorders" class="sc-f9178328-0 kgTYQp"&gt;&lt;i id="bbc-action-line" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt;BBC Action Line&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="" class="sc-d16436d-0 iVdNuz"&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Meanwhile, online eating-disorder communities have become spaces where Molecule is promoted, with users relying on hashtags and coded terms to slip past moderation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Ms Solovieva says Molecule is particularly harmful when taken by young people who already have eating disorders.

Also known as Xerostomia, this is an oral health condition that reduces saliva flow, leading to various symptoms including bad breath, rapid tooth decay and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How common is Dry Mouth?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to dentists, the condition is more common than you think.

However, Dr Kourosh Maddahi, a dentist at Dion Health in California shared with NBC Select, that the condition is underdiagnosed as people often mistake it with dehydration. And the longer it remains undiagnosed the more damage it creates for your oral health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;6 Home remedies to get rid of bad breath&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2023 report by the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ada.org/resources/ada-library/oral-health-topics/xerostomia#:~:text=Severity%20of%20dry%20mouth%20symptoms,22%25%20of%20the%20global%20population." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Dental Association&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; stated that dry mouth affects about 10 to 26 per cent of men and 10 to 33 per cent of women.

Most treatments for dry mouth consist of over-the-counter products such as mouthwashes, gels, chewing gums and lozenges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, sometimes longer lifestyle changes such as avoiding certain food items and drinks are also required. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding dry mouth or xerostomia&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In simple words, dry mouth is a condition that makes the mouth feel dry due to an inadequate amount of saliva. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most frequent causes of the condition are the use of certain medications. As per a 2018 study published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29071719/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Journal of the American Geriatrics Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, urologic medications, antidepressants and psycholeptics were associated with dry mouth in adults. Additionally, chemotherapy or head and neck cancer radiotherapy can also cause the condition as they directly cause toxicity to salivary glands and oral tissues. And, tobacco and cannabis use can also accelerate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dry mouth can be damaging to oral health because of the changes it causes to the amount and consistency of saliva in the mouth. Saliva is a natural antibiotic in the mouth and protects it from bacteria, acts as a lubricant, and cleans plaque and other particles from teeth. It also remineralises tooth enamel as it is packed with calcium and phosphate, making the teeth resistant to decay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a lack of saliva in the mouth, all the symptoms of dry mouth can amp up the progression of the condition and lead to more damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Note:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The information provided in this article is for educational purposes only and is not intended as medical advice.
