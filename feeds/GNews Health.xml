        &lt;p&gt;Few things in this world are more miserable than food poisoning. You go out to eat some delicious foods, or cook at home. You’re happy, full, and then… everything goes south. Sometimes literally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But hark! This torturous fate may soon be vanquished, thanks to some scientists at the University of Maryland who might just have created a vaccine that protects against Salmonella bacteria, one of the most common sources of foodborne illness and potentially life-threatening infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So far, the researchers have tested out their vaccine in human volunteers in a Phase I clinical trial. Not only did the vaccine appear to be safe and well-tolerated, it also seemed to create a robust immune response to the target bacteria.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These findings provide a strong foundation for future studies,” study co-author Myron Levine, professor emeritus at UM’s School of Medicine, said in a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-10-vaccine-typhoid-invasive-salmonella-human.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. The results were &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04003-z"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in Nature Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;A pervasive threat&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When people get Salmonella, it’s typically caused by a specific species of the bacteria, called &lt;em&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/em&gt;. But there are many subtypes, or serovars, of Salmonella within this species. One notorious subtype (&lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; Typhi) causes typhoid fever—an extreme form of food poisoning that causes a high fever (hence the name), a cough, rash, nausea, weakness, and diarrhea, and which can last as long as a month and require special antibiotics to treat. Other, non-typhoidal subtypes cause more typical food poisoning symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach pain.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The most common sources of Salmonella are undercooked meat, poultry, eggs, or unwashed fruit and vegetables, as well as through contact with infected people. Typhoid spreads similarly, and through water contaminated with the urine or feces of an infected person.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;More than a million Americans are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/food-safety/php/data-research/foodborne-illness-burden/index.html"&gt;sickened&lt;/a&gt; by Salmonella every year, and tens of thousands are hospitalized as a result. Most Salmonella infections don’t last long—just a few days or a week—but they can sometimes lead to severe, even fatal illness. These severe cases tend to happen when the bacteria spreads beyond the digestive tract and invades other parts of the body. They’re also more likely to occur in children under five, the elderly, or people with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s vaccine targets three different subtypes of Salmonella: the bacteria that cause typhoid fever and two other subtypes that are a common source of invasive infections in young children, especially in less developed areas of the world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s vaccine is a conjugate vaccine, meaning it combines polysaccharide antigens (sugar molecules, to put it plainly) from the outer coating of these bacteria with a carrier protein that boosts the immune system’s ability to recognize the bacteria. The vaccine is currently code-named the trivalent Salmonella conjugate vaccine, or TSCV.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Early promise&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers tested TSCV in a small, controlled trial involving 22 healthy adult volunteers from the U.S. Two groups received varying doses of the vaccine, while the third was given a placebo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Phase I trials are primarily meant to vet a drug or vaccine’s safety, and TSCV passed with flying colors. The vaccine was found to be safe, with the most common adverse event being pain at the injection site. Importantly, the researchers also detected a immune response to the three subtypes in all the vaccinated volunteers, including the production of antibodies, suggesting that TSCV works as intended.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Importantly, the findings are based on a small sample size. There is still plenty more work needed to affirm the vaccine’s broader safety and effectiveness. But if it keeps hitting its milestones, then TSCV could be a boon to the world, and especially for the people most vulnerable to severe Salmonella infections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“These results are highly encouraging,” lead researcher Wilbur Chen, a professor of medicine at UM, said in a statement. “They show that TSCV has the potential to protect children in regions where both typhoid and Salmonella are endemic and deadly.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;TSCV’s potential benefits could extend even beyond that. The subtypes it targets don’t just cause invasive infections, the researchers note, they’re also some of the most common strains of Salmonella that cause food poisoning in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, it is always important to practice good food safety and proper hygiene no matter what (wash your hands and don’t undercook your chicken, people), but it’d be incredible to know that in the future, when you are chowing down, Salmonella could be one less thing to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, a 49-year-old man visited Dr. Danielle Belardo, a cardiologist, with chest pain. For some time, he had been treating his high cholesterol not with the statin suggested by his doctor, but with berberine and red yeast rice supplements. He had heard they were more natural. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The supplements hadn’t managed his condition — far from it. Belardo discovered that he not only still had high cholesterol, but also had elevated liver enzymes and coronary artery disease so severe that he needed open-heart surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She referred him for the procedure and started him on two medications to bring down his cholesterol, including a statin. She also told him to quit the supplements. A few weeks later, the liver issues resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a time when Americans are buying and taking record amounts of supplements — well over half of adults consume one — some doctors and dietitians are trying to persuade patients to take it easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At her practice in Pasadena, Calif., Belardo often takes a hard line, regularly “de-prescribing” supplements. Last year, she persuaded one patient to stop taking 132 of them, including some to “detox” the kidneys and liver. Marily Oppezzo, an instructor of medicine at Stanford Prevention Research Center and a registered dietitian, said she channels decluttering powerhouse Marie Kondo by asking patients which ones spark “real, evidence-backed joy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wide variety of gummies, pills and powders are categorized as supplements, including vitamins and minerals, compounds like creatine and herbal products such as ashwagandha and kava. Almost all doctors say a few of them have their place; women benefit from taking folic acid, for example, when trying to have a baby. Some people have vitamin or mineral deficiencies that supplements can help address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But supplements can also come with side effects, which patients are sometimes “shocked” to learn about, said Dr. Mitra Rezvani, a hospitalist at Westchester Medical Center in New York. Many are merely uncomfortable — stomach issues, for example. But some are more serious. One paper in The New England Journal of Medicine estimated that supplements are responsible for 23,000 emergency room visits a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ways doctors broach the issue can vary. Rezvani has had patients list everything they’re taking and explain why, which helps start a discussion about what they should reconsider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Dr. Jen Gunter, an OB-GYN in San Francisco, tries to not push too hard. “The worst thing you can do is make a patient feel like they can’t talk to you,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, when she sees yet another patient taking probiotic supplements, “I’m always like, ‘Well, if those worked, you wouldn’t be coming to see me.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt; Nausea and rashes &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration only lightly regulates supplements, monitoring them less rigorously than drugs and not approving them for safety or effectiveness before they reach the public. Supplements have been found to be mislabeled, in terms of both the ingredients and their concentration. And some mix poorly with certain medications or with one another. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of what some have called “the wild west” nature of the market, it can be difficult to predict adverse side effects. Dr. Pieter Cohen, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who studies supplements, had one 45-year-old patient who developed rashes on her legs and back after starting on an anti-migraine supplement. Cohen suggested she stop taking the supplement, and the rashes went away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gunter worries about Ayurvedic supplements, some of which have been found to include lead, arsenic and mercury. Other doctors watch out for signs of supplement-related liver damage. Last year, researchers at the University of Michigan estimated that 15 million American adults take a supplement that could potentially cause liver toxicity, such as turmeric or red yeast rice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rezvani once treated a 70-year-old woman who had been experiencing nausea, jaundice and dark urine after starting a turmeric supplement, as well as semaglutide, the compound in the medication Ozempic. Rezvani and her team determined the supplement had likely damaged the liver and possibly interacted with the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient stopped taking the supplement. Soon after, her liver function improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Overlooking underlying issues &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belardo said she understands why her patients turn to supplements. Prominent doctors sell and promote them online. The pharmaceutical and health care industries have left many Americans disillusioned. And some patients feel dismissed at the doctor, leading them to seek out alternative treatments for their pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, people may take a supplement to manage an unwanted symptom, instead of undergoing medical testing that would reveal the root cause of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, a 44-year-old woman came to Belardo for an evaluation. During the visit, the patient noted that, on a naturopath’s recommendation, she had been taking an iron supplement to treat anemia and fatigue, but she still felt tired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iron supplement itself didn’t concern Belardo. What did was that the naturopath had not probed the underlying problem. In hopes of figuring it out, Belardo sent the patient to a gastroenterologist, who performed a colonoscopy. The diagnosis: stage IV colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was an extreme version of a type of situation that frustrates her most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Months, if not years, of opportunity for earlier detection and treatment had been lost,” Belardo said, “because her care was reduced to supplement prescriptions.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If all childhood immunizations were given separately, it would take 20 visits to get a six-month-old fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The more visits, the more appointments, the more follow-up doses that are required, parents – given that lives are complicated and vaccine schedules are complicated – will be less likely to complete all the additional appointments or follow-up visits required,” Schwartz said. “Splitting up will mean that fewer kids will complete the MMR series.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Breaking them up “serves no purpose”, said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the co-inventor of a rotavirus vaccine. “We’re already talking about difficulties in affording all of this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some vaccines, like the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) shot, are only made together and cannot be broken up. While separate vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella were licensed in the 1960s, only the combined MMR shots are now available for use in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The current MMR shots in the US are made by Merck and GSK. Both companies have &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/06/nx-s1-5563869/cdc-covid-vaccine-recommendation" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; there is no published scientific evidence to support separating the vaccines, and the combination vaccines play an important role in making vaccination easy and inexpensive. Releasing separate vaccines now would require entirely new saline placebo-controlled clinical trials under new Trump administration policies – an “unimaginable” process when safe and effective vaccines already exist, Schwartz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Even if manufacturers were able to create new trials for separate vaccines, it would be “incredibly unethical” to conduct them, said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“You would be exposing, basically, infants to potentially lethal diseases,” she said. No ethics and regulatory board would approve such a trial, and providers and families are unlikely to participate, she added. “Those trials won’t happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There was another &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; of the CDC’s advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) planned for 22-23 October. It has been indefinitely postponed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s anyone’s guess,” Schwartz said. The ACIP could say they would like to see monovalent vaccines, but there are no monovalent vaccines approved for them to recommend, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the meeting in September, the independent advisers began a discussion of delaying the hepatitis B vaccine, the first of which is currently recommended at birth, but they tabled the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Young children usually receive later hepatitis B doses as part of combination shots – so if that recommendation is changed, the combination vaccines would be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Offit has “no idea” what the vaccine advisers might discuss, he said. “These people are not making decisions based on scientific data, they’re making decisions based on their own sort of anti-vaccine notions – so who knows. Anything can happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But, he said, discussions about breaking up MMR specifically were asked and answered by the ACIP more than two decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Offit served on the ACIP from 1998 to 2003, during which time the now-retracted study led by Andrew Wakefield was published and gained attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Wakefield claimed without evidence in the study that there was a potential link too autism between “the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (rather than monovalent measles vaccine)”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A year before the study was published, Wakefield had filed a patent application for a monovalent measles vaccine, though he did not disclose this conflict of interest in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Wakefield argued that the combination shot weakened the immune system and created cascading effects that led to autism. “We had no evidence for any of this,” Offit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The ACIP held a vote on changing the MMR vaccine recommendation soon after the study was published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We obviously all voted no, because there was no evidence that MMR caused autism,” Offit said. There were already epidemiological studies at that time showing no relationship between being autistic and getting vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In September, the ACIP voted to remove the recommendation for the combination MMR and varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, a move that was officially adopted by the CDC last week. The changes are already creating confusion among patients and pediatric offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Let’s not underestimate just how damaging complexity and confusion are for vaccination efforts, for both patients and families and healthcare providers,” Schwartz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Making the process more confusing, expensive and time-consuming is another way to keep kids from being vaccinated, Rasmussen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“By making many of these vaccines monovalent, that’s going to actually just remove access to them, and there won’t be any vaccines at all,” she continued. “Those vaccines will probably still get made, but if a vaccine is sitting on a shelf and not going into somebody’s arm, then it’s worthless, essentially. I think anti-vaxxers love vaccines that sit on shelves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 12:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFBheU4yQ0FoRURraGJrNF9GYmQ4aVZheDdFNGVmaElFWFpJZ2Y5X0p4MHBNNHU4UjJpLVNqdHFvVTNSQ1l5ejh0aWxtX0VKejUzeFQtRnVUaTl1cUl0UnFEQ0dyZWlNUzhpbm85T19oT1ZlN0xqUUdtaVpCY1N4dw</guid></item><item><title>根据医生的说法，流感疫苗注射后应避免的三件事-包括服用扑热息痛-每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15176739/flu-jab-complications-paracetamol-warning.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 30 million people in the UK will be offered a &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/flu/index.html" id="mol-00474430-a507-11f0-bbf2-9d28afbd9a13"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt; vaccine this winter—but doctors say that while the jab is safe and effective, a few common habits could make it less effective or leave you feeling worse afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The flu vaccine is recommended for those most at risk of serious illness, including people aged 65 and over, pregnant women and anyone with a weakened immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can more than halve the risk of catching flu, yet research suggests simple choices before and after vaccination can influence how well it works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the biggest mistakes, experts say, is reaching for painkillers too soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research shows that anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen can dampen the body's immune response by blocking the inflammation needed to create protective antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Paracetamol is considered safe for easing mild side effects such as a sore arm or a low fever, but doctors advise avoiding it before your jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies suggest that taking it pre-emptively could blunt the vaccine's effectiveness in a similar way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overuse of painkillers carries its own risks.

And you need to be particularly careful if you're over 65.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors say the message is simple: Use painkillers only if you really need them, and at the lowest effective dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Having a drink could also make you feel worse after your jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the occasional glass of wine is unlikely to cause harm, heavy drinking is known to weaken the immune system by affecting white blood cells' ability to fight infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can increase the risk of fatigue, muscle aches and soreness around the injection site—and leave you more vulnerable to catching other bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol is also a diuretic, meaning it increases fluid loss through urine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can lead to dehydration, which some studies suggest may delay the production of antibodies, making the vaccine slightly less effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exercise can make a difference too. Experts recommend avoiding intense workouts for a day or two after vaccination, as high-intensity training can increase fatigue and headaches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But moderate activity appears to have the opposite effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2022 study found that people who went for a brisk 90-minute walk, jog or bike ride after their flu jab produced more infection-fighting antibodies than those who didn't—without any increase in side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, adults who develop such disorders are underrepresented in both the research and within treatment settings, leaving a critical gap in understanding the true scope of the problem, said Samantha DeCaro, a psychologist, and the director of clinical outreach and education at the &lt;a href="https://renfrewcenter.com/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7954061" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Renfrew Center&lt;/a&gt;, a national eating disorder treatment center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Midlife adults meet the same diagnostic criteria as younger patients ― struggling with symptoms such as restricting, bingeing or purging,” said DeCaro, who also co-hosts the podcast &lt;a href="https://allbodiesallfoods.podbean.com/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7954061" data-affiliate="true"&gt;&lt;em&gt;All Bodies. All Foods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What sets them apart, however, are the unique life transitions that can trigger or exacerbate body dissatisfaction and disordered eating: menopause, divorce, an ‘empty nest,’ chronic illness, physical changes, and the challenges of aging in an ageist society,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;

Perched on a hill close to a set of railroad tracks, he could memorise all the numbers of the train carriages that sped by at &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;30 mph,&lt;/span&gt; add them up, and provide the correct total sum. What was remarkable about the case was not just his ability to calculate large numbers (and read them on a moving vehicle), but the fact that he could barely eat unassisted or recognise the faces of people he met. The juxtaposition between his supposed arrested development and his numerical facility made his mathematical feats even more impressive. ‘How can you account for it?’ asked the article’s author. The answer took the form of a medical label: the boy was what 19th-century medicine termed an ‘idiot savant’. He possessed an exceptional talent, despite a profound impairment of the mental faculties that affected both his motor and social skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A century after &lt;em&gt;The Review &lt;/em&gt;relayed the prodigious child’s mathematical abilities, trying to understand ‘how they do it’ still drives psychological research into savantism or ‘savant syndrome’ to this day. The SSM Health Treffert Centre in Wisconsin – named after Darold Treffert (1933-2020), one of the leading experts in the field – defines the savant phenomenon as ‘a rare condition in which persons with various developmental disorders, including autistic disorder, have an amazing ability and talent’. Today, savantism is largely comprehended through the lens of &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/psychology/neurodiversity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;neurodivergence&lt;/a&gt;, since the association between savantism and autism is strong: roughly one in 10 people with autism exhibit some savant skills, while savantism in the absence of autism is much rarer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychological studies by Simon Baron-Cohen and Michael Lombardo, for example, have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5789212/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;focused&lt;/a&gt; on the neurological basis of ‘systemising’, where exceptional mathematical or musical skills exist among people diagnosed with autism: such people are ‘hypersystemisers’, that is, they are especially good at identifying ‘laws, rules, and/or regularities’. It is believed that their brain’s systemising mechanisms are ‘tuned to very high levels’, making them acutely sensitive to sensory input and also capable of intense attentional focus and rule-learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the past (autism became a diagnostic category only in 1943), the ‘idiot savant’ was a paradox, who confounded categorisation because there was no unified way of comprehending how such exceptional musical and numerical skills might co-exist alongside their polar opposite: profound disability. To use the language of the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;19th century,&lt;/span&gt; how could a person be at once both a ‘genius’ and an ‘idiot’? The savant challenged conventional understandings of how talent was manifested, and who could manifest it, and at the same time upset notions of who might be classed as an ‘idiot’. In the scheme of how intelligence was understood then, the savant was at best otherworldly and at worst a monstrosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The historian Patrick McDonagh &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/liverpool-scholarship-online/book/15444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; that ‘idiocy’ was a highly ambiguous medical term that was nonetheless widely accepted. Perhaps, in part, because it was a boundaried category that fulfilled an important social-symbolic function: namely, it offered a contrast against which modern individuals could define themselves as rational and intelligent, reinforcing their claims to respect and social authority. It also meant that people like that 11-year-old boy who was fascinated with numbers but was nonetheless considered an ‘idiot’ – in the medical parlance of the day – created a contradiction that continues to have implications today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he term ‘idiot savant’ was coined in the 1860s by the French physician and educational reformer Edouard Séguin &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;(1812-80).&lt;/span&gt; While researching the state of education for so-called ‘feeble-minded children’ in the United States (where he became naturalised), Séguin identified a particular type of child who seemed to excel in one skill despite demonstrating significant mental impairment. According to Séguin, these ‘idiot savants’ were specific to the elite classes, which were already characterised by their excessive desire for luxury and lack of useful contribution to society. For Séguin, the idiot savant – ‘Men abnormally developed in one direction … but idiotic in every other respect’ – was the physical embodiment of this uselessness. He wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is from this [wealthier] class almost exclusively that we have musical, mathematical, architectural, and other varieties of the &lt;em&gt;idiot savant&lt;/em&gt;; useless protrusion of a single faculty, accompanied by a wo[e]ful general impotence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a time when the middle classes were grappling with the fear of social degeneration, Séguin’s pejorative comments went beyond medical observation to reflect a broader critical attitude towards the aristocracy, who were viewed as effete, weakened and hypochondriacal. The idiot savant reinforced these class stereotypes: even their talents, no matter how precocious, were useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Séguin’s position was by no means universal. Physicians like John Langdon Down in England argued that cases of ‘idiots savants’ could be found among all classes of society, and that their exceptional talent could (and should) be trained as a way to contribute to society through their art and skills. One of the savants under Langdon Down’s care was James Henry Pullen, who arrived at the Earlswood Asylum in Surrey in 1850 at the age of 15. Unschooled and largely deaf, he had a very restricted vocabulary: what little Pullen could write or say had been taught to him by his family. However, he showed an enthusiasm for drawing and carving; he had been whittling ships from small pieces of firewood from a young age and without any training in carpentry and, after arriving at Earlswood, he was put to work in the carpenter’s shop. Quickly, he became an expert carpenter. He built furniture for the asylum, though his true delight was in fashioning large-scale models of real and imagined ships. Pullen, his caretaker explained, ‘could build exquisite model ships from drawings, and carve with a great deal of skill, who yet could not understand a sentence – who had to have it dissected for him.’ Pullen’s career spanned his &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;66 years&lt;/span&gt; at Earlswood, during which time his ships won numerous prizes and international recognition – including that of Edward, Prince of Wales, who sent him ivory tusks as encouragement to continue producing &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;his art.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Her caretakers praised her sweet mannerisms and happy demeanour, which fit with the humble values of the time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Langdon Down believed that, by developing their skills, individuals such as Pullen could become both more self-supporting and useful to society. Indeed, such beliefs were the driving motivation behind the education of intellectually disabled individuals in the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;19th century.&lt;/span&gt; Like many other labels used to pathologise behaviour, for example the ‘juvenile delinquent’ and the ‘homosexual’, the creation of the ‘idiot savant’ medical category became crucial in debates about rights and responsibilities in a period characterised by a strong belief in the meritocratic order of society, as a tool to legitimise social difference – and to moralise it too, by invoking the need to be charitable. Pullen’s case illustrates how individual talent, social recognition and institutional benefits could co-exist and shape the lived experience of an individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dynamic is exemplified in the case of a young talented woman, whose name has been lost to history, permanently resident at the renowned psychiatric hospital &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;La Salpêtrière&lt;/span&gt; in Paris. Born blind and both physically and intellectually disabled, her ‘musical memory and voice’ were a joy both to her and to those who shared their day-to-day lives with her. She was involved in the asylum choir and was responsible for correcting the other members’ voices. Her caretakers praised her sweet mannerisms and happy demeanour, which fit with the humble values of the time: one must not brag about what one is born with, but accept it with grace, and use it for the common good. Her skills were so well known that the contemporary composers Jean-Antoine-Just Géraldy, Franz Liszt and Giacomo Meyerbeer all visited her in person and praised her unique talent. As the asylum director explained, her talent would have warranted a high social status had it not been for the fact that she was highly dependent on others to look after herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;uring the second half of the 19th century, the nature of genius became one of the central debates within the human sciences. In the context of the theory of degeneration, which migrated from natural history to evolutionary theory, and which &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0957154X9300401501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; that civilisation was in decline due to the inheritance of undesirable characteristics, genius became an ambiguous quality: it could either guarantee progress or further contribute to society’s decay. Understanding what genius was and how it emerged became a pressing issue with social consequences. Was genius something that appeared spontaneously, or the product of an individual’s hard efforts? Could it be harnessed and cultivated for the greater good? Less positively, genius had historically been associated with madness in some way, and this posed yet another issue: was genius a pathology? Were people with prodigious abilities actually mad? And what did that mean for those men responsible for the progress of society, who were often classed as geniuses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three singular authors came to represent each of these questions: the Italian criminologist Cesare Lombroso, the British eugenicist Francis Galton, and the British sexologist Havelock Ellis. Using statistical analysis, Galton claimed that genius was an inherited quality that emerged independently from education. It was for this reason that men of science begot other men of science: genius was handed down. His hereditarian understanding of genius had important implications for the theory of eugenics, which took hold in the early &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;20th century&lt;/span&gt; among thinkers convinced that a better society (or ‘race’) of people might be built by encouraging reproduction between individuals who had exceptional qualities useful to the rest of society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;That his father, grandfather and brother were all drummers was proof of the patient’s apparently innate talent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Lombroso – notorious for his work on criminal anthropology and the creation of criminal ‘types’ based solely on physical features – argued that genius was a pathological condition similar to insanity. For Lombroso, genius was like a pearl: the result of a morbid alteration that produced something beautiful. But the fact that it could be found among criminals confirmed its ultimately sick nature. Finding a middle ground, Ellis proposed that genius was a hereditary trait associated with idiocy (as opposed to madness), whereby one faculty was overdeveloped at the expense of the rest of the proper functioning of the mind and body. By way of example, he cited the excessive clumsiness that geniuses often seemed to exhibit, but the key to understanding the real nature of talent rested, Ellis argued, in the figure of the ‘idiot savant’ rather than the lunatic, thereby placing genius on the same scale as idiocy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, physicians debated whether or not talent ran in the families of savants. Some cited examples of several family members demonstrating the same ability, among them the case of a man permanently resident at the Salpêtrière who, without ever having played an instrument, had the opportunity to pick up a drum and play with great talent. Upon further inspection, it turned out that the other men in his family were all skilled drum players: that his father, grandfather and brother had all been drummers was proof of the patient’s apparently innate talent. Other physicians countered that the appearance of this ability was random, even freakish; leaning into the paradox of the patient, they confirmed that his ability was pathological, while also highlighting its admirable exceptionalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he study of genius was linked to another issue: the problem of precocity. During the 19th and &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;20th centuries,&lt;/span&gt; as studies in the field of child development grew, and the IQ test, which defined intelligence in quantifiable terms, became an increasingly &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/on-the-dark-history-of-intelligence-as-domination" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;common tool&lt;/a&gt; to sort children into categories, two different ‘types’ of age became relevant: chronological and mental. The former referred to the natural passing of time of any individual, with its associated physical changes and growth. Meanwhile, mental age indicated the different skills and behaviours that most individuals reached at a similar point in time, reflecting different stages of mental development. Proper development required a correlation between the two, and any deviation from the norm was pathologised. Precocity and idiocy were two sides of the same coin: a lack of correspondence between the individual’s natural age and their &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;mental age.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paradigmatic example of precocity was the child prodigy. Records of precocious children date back to the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;18th century,&lt;/span&gt; with examples including Mozart and Christian Heinrich Heineken, a prodigious child also known as ‘the infant scholar of Lübeck’, who, in his brief four years of life, could speak fluent German by the age of one, and read different biblical canons at the ages of two and three. However, as Andrea Graus has &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/hop0000192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt;, it wasn’t until the mid-&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;19th century&lt;/span&gt; that the figure of the child prodigy became a more widespread cultural phenomenon. Linked to the emergence of the entertainment industry and also the growth of developmental psychology, these children became subjects of scientific and popular fascination. Parents and managers alike quickly saw the economic benefit they could obtain from such children, and toured them nationally and internationally, in line with a culture of spectacle that drew masses of people to witness ‘freaks’ of nature. The performances of children like the Italian ‘mental calculator’ Vito Mangiamele &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;(1827-97),&lt;/span&gt; the Spanish pianist Pepito Arriola &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;(1895-1954)&lt;/span&gt; or the Polish-born chess player Samuel Reshevsky &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;(1911-92)&lt;/span&gt; attracted large crowds, while they also became subjects of scientific scrutiny as psychologists tried to understand how it was possible for such talent to appear at such a young age. (Their answer? They had a prodigious memory, rather than any kind of creative ability.) The child prodigy embodied contradictory images of genius on the one hand, and mechanistic underdevelopment on the other: the same contrast that appeared in the idiot savant, whose representatives were often infantilised on account of their idiocy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These conflicting understandings came together in one of the most famous examples of savantism in the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;19th century:&lt;/span&gt; the pianist and composer Thomas ‘Blind Tom’ Wiggins. His case stands out for its singularity: Wiggins was Black, born into enslavement, and had both a physical and a mental disability. By the age of five, he demonstrated an exceptional talent for playing the piano and composing his own music, and at eight he began a career playing solo shows. Wiggins was exhibited across the country by his slaveholder (and, later, his manager), and the pamphlets advertising his talent claimed that it was purely natural, a raw material that could be ‘extracted’ for entertainment purposes, and was both fascinating and grotesque in its genius. (The analogy of extraction is not a coincidence: the historian Lindsay J Wright &lt;a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/ncm/article-abstract/47/1/33/197215/Black-Musicality-and-the-Invention-of-Talent-The?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; that Wiggins’s career took place against the backdrop of the Californian Gold Rush.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;One of the explanations put forward to explain Wiggins’s skill directly invoked his Blackness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, historians of Wiggins’s case have cast doubt on the &lt;em&gt;sui generis&lt;/em&gt; nature of his genius. While the shows emphasised his improvisational skills and ability to copy tunes from a young age as illustrations of his innate talent, historians note that Wiggins received piano lessons and was accompanied by an instructor with whom he practised his own compositions and those of others. Those close to Wiggins also pointed out that he was not an idiot, but rather ‘frantically delighted or bewitched, if you please, over the music he is making or hearing’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiggins attained a celebrity status accessible to only a few during his period. People were mesmerised by his skill. In 1912, a chronicler for &lt;em&gt;The Seattle Star&lt;/em&gt; described it as Wiggins ‘fe[eling] his way through the mazes of the most complex music’ in a way that was superhuman, as though he was touched by God. But others branded it monstrous. The American writer Mark Twain thought him almost demonically possessed; in a letter to &lt;em&gt;The Daily Alta California&lt;/em&gt; in 1869, he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;All the schooling of a life-time could not teach a man to do this wonderful thing, I suppose – but this, blind, uninstructed idiot of nineteen does it without any trouble. Some archangel, cast out of upper Heaven like another Satan, inhabits this coarse casket … It is not Blind Tom that does these wonderful things and plays this wonderful music – it is the other party.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, a tension existed around the (impossible) figure of this incredibly talented blind Black man who referred to himself in the third person and clapped eccentrically during his performances. In a society that placed social status on an individual’s innate gift, attempts such as Twain’s to ascribe Wiggins’s talent to something else were strategies to explain away phenomena that did not fit the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;status quo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ld-embed-block-wrapper"&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://youtube.com/embed/V-Qq0o1S4vo" class="ld-embed-block"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;figcaption class="ld-embed-caption"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, one of the explanations put forward to explain Wiggins’s skill directly invoked his Blackness. In the mid-&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;19th century,&lt;/span&gt; rhythm was understood to be corporeal, not intellectual, linked more to impulse and sensuality than to reason, largely on the grounds of believing that children, idiots and Black people all exhibited an easy appreciation of music, despite their savage, uncivilised natures. In pointedly racial tones, white Americans argued that Black people possessed an ‘innate musicality’, invoking musical ability as a way to perpetuate notions of essential difference. Similarly, Séguin promoted the use of music as a pedagogical tool that might stimulate the senses and develop the attentional focus of idiots, while noting that ‘their taste is of the popular or coloured kind’. Wiggins, a Black disabled man, confirmed these racially skewed ideas on two counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;ince the Enlightenment, when the intellectual order was understood to mirror the social order, talented intellectually disabled individuals posed a problem for understanding the human mind and for naturalising social difference. This is particularly evident in the case of arithmetical ability. Outside of the universitites, it was considered a niche acquisition with little intellectual prestige, restricted mainly to the mercantile sector; but, with the spread of commercialisation, arithmetic became more important and was commonly seen as a marker of the power of reason. Prestigious mathematicians like Carl Friedrich Gauss in Europe and Nathaniel Bowditch in the US, renowned for their prodigious abilities, became symbols of Enlightenment genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there were other 18th-century figures, like Jedediah Buxton in England and Thomas Fuller, an enslaved African in Virginia, who could neither read nor write but who demonstrated exceptional calculating skills. For Enlightenment men of science, such individuals offered an insight into the workings of the mind while at the same time posing a threat to the order of society. How could men like Buxton and Fuller be paragons of reason if they couldn’t hold a conversation? Their answer leant on the science of mind to explain that savant-like skill signified an exceptionally developed faculty of memory, and was not a real marker of reason. In the developmental theory of the time, memory was one of the first (and therefore less sophisticated) faculties to develop. As a result, these men of science used cognitive difference as a way to legitimise social hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;These practices once again denied intellectually disabled people the possibility of creativity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As medical science shifted in the 19th century towards an anatomo-clinical model, explanations for phenomena of the mind became increasingly rooted in the body – specifically, the brain and the nervous system. Idiocy shifted towards being understood as the product of brain lesions or deformities. When it came to the idiot savant, physicians theorised that their talent was due to brain protrusions and an uneven growth of the organ of the mind, in line with phrenological theories that claimed that the brain was divided into separate sections, each representing a distinct quality or ability that could be measured by studying the skull. Wherever possible, autopsies were carried out on the brains of idiot savants to find out if the cerebral tissue could shed more light on their unexpected talent. Some doctors theorised that the idiot savant would lose their special skill if they developed the rest of their brain functions to restore a more balanced state of mind, since their talent was caused by unequal development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These practices once again denied intellectually disabled people the possibility of creativity: their abilities were ascribed instead to a pathology of brain or mind, or else explained away as nothing more than excellent imitation skills. ‘There is no spontaneous invention,’ affirmed the US neurologist Frederick Peterson in 1896: ‘The &lt;em&gt;idiot savants&lt;/em&gt; are mere copyists in music, modelling, designing, or painting.’ Of course, imitation and repetition are central to the development of any skill, but men such as Peterson invoked these behaviours as a way of denying creativity to savants. Since creativity was so tightly linked to the soul, Peterson and his kind reinforced the idea that idiot savants were not fully human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;n a groundbreaking paper in 1943, the Austrian-American psychologist Leo Kanner described autism as being characterised by aloneness, a fixation with objects and the repetition of actions (like writing the same word over and over or shaking their head from side to side), as well as a preference for routines and for their surroundings to stay the same. Atypical cases Kanner discussed in his paper included children who could recognise composers and squirm in pleasure at their music by the age of one and a half, count to 100 by the age of two, sing a substantial repertoire before the age of three, and who had a remarkable ability to spell and complete arithmetic as a memory feat by the age of eight. Kanner argued that these children were born with an innate talent and a unique way of looking at the world. At a time when ideas about intellectual disability were opening up to psychoanalytical and social interpretations, Kanner’s description of children with autism gave room for imagination and uniqueness, while still defending the idea that their brains were wired differently, genetically and neurologically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Savantism continues to fascinate us to this day. Even now, when we operate with the more inclusive category of neurodivergence as opposed to pathology, savantism’s rarity and precocity invite interest. We marvel at Stephen Wiltshire’s ability to draw large cityscapes from memory, or at Leslie Lemke’s ability to play a complex piece of music after listening to it just once. But marvelling has itself been problematised as a form of othering. Kim Peek’s exceptional memory skills might have made him the inspiration for &lt;em&gt;Rain Man&lt;/em&gt; (1988), but the film’s portrayal of Raymond Babbitt (Peek’s avatar) as an infantilised incompetent has drawn pointed criticism from the neurodivergent community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;The savant is still a rare curio, even if the neurological context in which we comprehend them has changed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For its part, the disability community has expressed frustration over the cultural over-representation of exceptionally talented autistic figures for creating harmful stereotypes that render invisible those people with disabilities who are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; exceptionally talented. Turning a historical lens on savantism is telling in revealing precisely how at different times we conceive and police ideas about who can be creative in different ways. What becomes evident in the rear-view mirror is that the medical discourse around savantism was not primarily about health, or even the sciences of the mind, but rather about politics and power(lessness).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we no longer brand idiot savants as monstrous, it remains a moot question how far we’ve really come. We still trip over this almost voyeuristic idea of exceptional, unexpected talent that make such figures inexplicable and intriguing. The savant is still a rare curio, even if the neurological context in which we comprehend them has changed. Disability scholars such as Joseph N Straus and Marion Quirici point out that merely by asking how exceptional talent can appear alongside disability, we reproduce social views that present disabled individuals as ‘Others’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the argument cuts two ways. Studies in psychology that comprehend talent as intrinsic to neurodivergent conditions such as autism spectrum disorder have given rise to a popular narrative that sees genius as innate, leading people to speak of disabled savants with so much awe and admiration that they become ‘supercrips’ – people who overcome their disability through their mysterious inborn talent. But this supposedly positive take still styles disabled people as being ‘not like us’. Otherworldly is still Other, and it imposes the need to be ‘more than’ in order to be accepted. As many disability advocates argue, these narratives of overcoming compound the idea that a disability is something negative, while obstructing the discomfiting subversive agency that disabled individuals can tap into through their very existence. To the extent that we still struggle to comprehend neurological complexity, the figure of the ‘idiot savant’ is a reminder that we need to do better at unpicking, processing and accepting difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Aeon</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 10:03:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxQTkFJQ1BtMlVjajN0bEdIeDdvS3JTeFZTekVNOFB2bFVaVlJUbURyLXN1TXdGX2JsWDFJWW5PXzFVTkM0V3VIaWF0azlNRE5fWEVta3lJbGpEdVcwTFZLVTR1Rk9SNDBvMnhRZjNWSFVVRmdNMlVLTGJRS1NDRF9IX3lmNW5ZWTRTSWc</guid></item><item><title>以科学为后盾的步骤，将烤肉的癌症风险降低高达90 ％ - AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/articles/backed-science-step-cuts-cancer-090100706.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Key Points&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grilling meat at high temperatures can produce carcinogenic compounds, but marinating before cooking can reduce those chemicals by more than 90%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marinades that include ingredients like vinegar, citrus, wine, yogurt, and antioxidant-rich herbs such as garlic, rosemary, and thyme are the most effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts advise pairing grilled meats with fruits and vegetables to help counteract harmful compounds and decrease long-term cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grilled meat certainly makes for a great dinner. However, there's one side effect that no one wants as a side dish: an &lt;a href="https://www.columbiadoctors.org/news/do-grilled-foods-cause-cancer" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:increased risk of cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;increased risk of cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, there's a very simple — and delicious — way to reduce that risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/grilling-meat-raises-cancer-risk-here-are-ways-lower-it" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UCLA Health Center;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;UCLA Health Center&lt;/a&gt; (and &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/cooked-meats-fact-sheet" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:numerous studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;numerous studies&lt;/a&gt;) explains, "eating meat cooked over high temperatures can increase the risk of cancer" because it can char the meat, which "produces carcinogenic chemicals known as heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons." The more you're exposed to these chemicals, the more damage they can do to your DNA, and "over time can develop into tumors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while there are many ways to reduce your risk, such as not overcooking your meat, trimming off charred areas, and turning your meat frequently while cooking over an open flame, experts also recommend one more tasty option: marinating your meat first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/condiments/marinades/marinades" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:16 Marinade Recipes for Ultimate Flavor Infusion;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;16 Marinade Recipes for Ultimate Flavor Infusion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Marinades can significantly reduce the carcinogenic compounds formed in grilling or cooking meats at high temperatures. Even marinating meat for as little as 40 minutes seems to reduce these compounds by over 90%," the &lt;a href="https://www.karmanos.org/karmanos/documents-and-links/marinades-for-grilling-7361" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Karmanos Cancer Institute;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Karmanos Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt; at Wayne State University explained. The institute noted that it's unclear why marinades seem to be so protective, but it could be due to the antioxidants in the marinade or because it gives a "simple cooling effect of marinades on meat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The marinade of sugar and oil may just act as a barrier between the meat and the heat, then that is what becomes seared instead of the meat," Nigel Brockton, the vice president of research at the American Institute for Cancer Research, &lt;a href="https://www.aicr.org/news/practicing-safe-grilling-can-reduce-cancer-risk-experts-say/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:shared in a statement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;shared in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.

The study also found that the longer you marinate, the better the results; however, excessive time in marinades can alter the meat's texture, so it's best to keep the marination time to 24 hours or less. Additionally, it found that the most effective ingredients for reducing harmful chemicals include acids such as vinegar, citrus juice, wine, and yogurt, as well as herbs and spices like garlic, onion, rosemary, thyme, and oregano.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6 ways to make your grilled meat less carcinogenic&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2025 report published in the journal &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s44187-025-00391-w.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Discover Food;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discover Food&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provided six simple tips to lower your carcinogen risk when cooking meat. They include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="caas-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use butter, olive oil, or other fats, and avoid direct exposure to the pan or heat source when cooking meat or fish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reduce cooking temperature and cooking time whenever possible to reduce carcinogen formation. According to the researchers, the most effective method is to pre-cook the meat in the microwave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regularly flip your meat over an open flame to minimize carcinogen formation and prevent the meat from overheating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use both "natural and synthetic antioxidants" to neutralize free radicals. Think of herbs and spices like garlic, ginger, pepper, tomato, and onion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apply flavorings and marinades before cooking to further reduce your risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use an air fryer, infrared oven, or sous vide whenever possible to minimize charring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main point isn't to worry too much about your meats, as long as you aren't charring every meal every single day. “It's not so much a one-time experience, such as an occasion where you kept your meat on the grill too long and it turned black. It’s more of a message about one’s lifestyle,” Dr. Catherine Carpenter, a professor of clinical nutrition and a member of the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, added. “You’ve been cooking that way for 30 years; every weekend, there’s a barbecue, you grill the meat at high temperatures, and all of this blackening occurs. That's when it becomes a problem in terms of cancer risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carpenter and her colleagues have one more way to reduce your risk of cancer, and that's by pairing your meat with fruits and vegetables, "which contain antioxidants that counteract the effects of the cancer-causing chemicals."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to build a better marinade&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marinating your meat before grilling isn’t just about flavor — it’s a proven way to reduce the harmful compounds that can form when cooking over high heat. A good marinade adds moisture, creates a barrier against smoke and flame, and delivers protective antioxidants that help prevent charring from turning dangerous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use an acidic base&lt;/strong&gt;: Start with vinegar, citrus juice, wine, or yogurt to tenderize meat and limit carcinogen formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add antioxidant boosters&lt;/strong&gt;: Add herbs and spices like garlic, onion, rosemary, thyme, and oregano for extra protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't forget about barrier builders&lt;/strong&gt;: A touch of oil or sugar helps create a light coating that sears instead of burns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timing tip&lt;/strong&gt;: Marinate for a minimum of 40 minutes for maximum benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/how-marinades-reduce-cancer-risk-11803529" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Food &amp;amp; Wine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Food &amp;amp; Wine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 09:42:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxNUnlGYlE2VGFfT0dyZjdBR0phSWg3TkxaTWE0SzBrRWdRczBwZXRTS1QzMEZidzhKZ3BheGJ5REFhWmtrZG9hcFo3bURiekpQNWxOQ0s0dXFhOWZLa3FGdWlMbjBJMmRRSHlFSDlPZnZuZEh6dFUzYjlPMVVMd2d2bw</guid></item><item><title>夏季喘息后，禽流感病例再次飙升- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/bird-flu-cases-spiking-rcna235519</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-89fbd0" class="body-graf"&gt;It was a quiet summer for bird flu: Egg prices fell a bit, fewer sick poultry flocks were culled on farms, and officials took a breath. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0739ad" class="body-graf"&gt;“It was lovely,” said Shauna Voss, the assistant director of the Minnesota Board of Animal Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e43535" class="body-graf"&gt;But it didn’t last. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-56e5d8" class="body-graf"&gt;Bird flu is spreading again, now that wild water fowl — geese, ducks and cranes — have begun their seasonal migrations. As the birds travel, they mingle at lakes and ponds and share viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-631cdb" class="body-graf"&gt;In poultry, bird flu cases are spiking earlier than expected. More than 4 million poultry birds have been culled in the last month, in states including Minnesota and Iowa, after members of their flock tested positive for the virus, called H5N1. The trend corresponds to a spike in infections detected among wild birds in northern states.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fc86c1" class="body-graf"&gt;Some state officials are bracing for a challenging autumn, which is when cases have typically spiked in past years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9adf09" class="body-graf"&gt;“Last week, we had our first confirmed positive,” Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig said. The case was on a turkey farm in Calhoun County. “The question for us then is how extensive will it be and what kind of fall will we have.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8fb556" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s too early to say what effect the outbreaks will have on egg prices, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a7072b" class="body-graf"&gt;“The only honest answer to that is we will have to see. I wish I could give you more than that,” Naig said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0384be" class="body-graf"&gt;This is the fourth fall in which bird flu infections have risen, a sign the virus is becoming endemic in wild birds and could be a continual threat to poultry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8fc3a3" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s not going away. It seems pretty embedded,” Voss said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-87f1fe" class="body-graf"&gt;The more the virus circulates, there is a risk that it will unlock a way to readily infect humans. If that becomes a problem, some experts fear that the Trump administration’s cuts to mRNA research could hamper scientists’ ability to rapidly develop a new vaccine. For now, though, the health risk to people remains low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8a7726" class="body-graf"&gt;As fall progresses, officials, wildlife experts and virologists are in a watch-and-wait mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aafb3e" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s an interesting time,” said Declan Schroeder, an associate professor of virology at the University of Minnesota’s College of Veterinary Medicine. “Everyone is waiting with bated breath to see what’s going to happen.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="body-hori-rule"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f49634" class="body-graf"&gt;Avian influenza was first detected in a U.S. commercial flock in February 2022, after circulating in wild birds before then. The virus is almost always deadly for poultry birds, and as of this summer, more than 175 million birds had been culled or killed. Two years ago, researchers were &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/bird-flu-cases-spread-warning-signs-rcna185084" target="_blank"&gt;surprised to discover that bird flu had spread to dairy cows&lt;/a&gt; and was found in raw, unpasteurized milk, prompting a slew of changes to farm practices and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/usda-orders-testing-milk-bird-flu-rcna183212" target="_blank"&gt;milk testing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5aec88" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;At least 70 people&lt;/a&gt; — mostly farmworkers with close contact to birds or cows — have been infected. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/first-human-bird-flu-death-us-louisiana-rcna186466" target="_blank"&gt;One person died&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9ce388" class="body-graf"&gt;Wild birds tend to spread the disease to poultry farms in a few ways, scientists think: through direct contact, by contaminating feed or when workers bring contaminated materials into barns. That’s why migration season can be such a catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9f0bea" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you got one sick bird that moves over an area, infects some others, the math suggests it’s going to spread really fast,” said Michael Ward, a professor of natural resources and environmental sciences at the University of Illinois, who studies migration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-14b26b" class="body-graf"&gt;Ward added that habitat limitations are pushing birds to congregate and share space, which makes viral spread more likely. In Illinois, wetland habitat has shrunk as the state deals with drought. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e96945" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s a perfect combination for disease to pop up,” Ward said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-305474" class="body-graf"&gt;In response to an inquiry about the rise in bird flu detections and how the federal government plans to deal with it, the U.S. Department of Agriculture pointed to a &lt;a href="https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/03/20/usda-update-progress-five-pronged-strategy-combat-avian-flu-and-lower-egg-prices" target="_blank"&gt;five-prong strategy it released in February&lt;/a&gt;, which included $100 million for research into new biosecurity measures and vaccine development for poultry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7b2ad3" class="body-graf"&gt;Countries like &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/bird-flu/bird-flu-egg-prices-vaccines-chickens-raw-milk-what-know-rcna193916" target="_blank"&gt;France are already vaccinating poultry birds&lt;/a&gt;, but the USDA said it continues to evaluate whether the U.S. should do so. The agency has not approved such a vaccine, and rolling one out would affect U.S. exports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c222f0" class="body-graf"&gt;“We really do believe that an effective vaccine strategy would be very helpful for the egg and turkey producers, but we understand that has to be carefully done to ensure there’s not an impact to other markets,” Naig, in Iowa, said. “USDA has put some focus on this and now we’re awaiting what that vaccine strategy could look like.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cf57e7" class="body-graf"&gt;Scientists have long been concerned that the bird flu virus might eventually develop the ability to spread effectively between people. Even given the low risk to humans at the moment, Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies infectious diseases, advised people to take basic steps to prevent infection with H5N1 as well as the seasonal flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7565ff" class="body-graf"&gt;“Get your flu shot. Don’t drink raw milk, don’t eat unpasteurized cheese, particularly when cases are circulating. Don’t let your cats feed outside when it’s migratory bird season,” Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a71a84" class="body-graf"&gt;A scenario in which a person gets infected with both H5N1 and seasonal flu at the same time could be problematic because it would enable the bird flu virus to more easily rearrange its genetic code to suit humans.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-50e4c4" class="body-graf"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stopped holding coordination calls on H5N1 with health providers this spring — a change Chin-Hong laments. He hopes the agency will resume the calls, and he disagrees with the Trump administration’s termination of mRNA vaccine research funding. The biotech company Moderna was &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-cuts-500-million-mrna-vaccine-contracts-dealing-major-blow-prom-rcna223281" target="_blank"&gt;developing a bird flu vaccine that used the mRNA platform&lt;/a&gt;, but the Department of Health and Human Services canceled its grant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-11bfeb" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;The CDC did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 09:00:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxOY0s3aURIZ1Z5eUlPSlZxdFhuNzNJM01Qb3dEdllSRlBwWGd1MWxhZG5MS09DWmFUNHB4dk5kTGJWa203U3hiM0lyemx3UHphVEh1dUlVTHBaOGpkVmJOc2hfc1o3bGJjbTRMdVdtOXA4TkRsRExRRjM0ZDE2YmJHeVRoT0HSAVZBVV95cUxNZmdCXzNHQnZCWE5zRnNXM3llaFBoUkhwMUhuSENzWms0VGxyandLWV9WZGtoeHp4eDl1YlZtS1BuR3ZfR0ZFc3hpeG5TalZLVnJrUlZTdw</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，帕金森氏症的风险可能会随着暴露于常见化学物质而增加- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/news/parkinson-risk-could-increase-exposure-204745838.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common chemical that is widespread in the U.S. has been linked to an increased risk of Parkinson’s disease, researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent study published in the journal Neurology, researchers found a "small but measurable increase in &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nervous-system-health/parkinsons-disease" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parkinson’s risk;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parkinson’s risk&lt;/a&gt;" linked to trichloroethylene (TCE), which has been found to spread in the air, water and soil in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TCE is a chlorinated solvent commonly used for degreasing metal parts and in industrial cleaning, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/study-links-mental-health-risks-toxin-those-born-60s-70s" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Study Links Mental Health Risks To This Toxin For Those Born In '60S Or '70S;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Study Links Mental Health Risks To This Toxin For Those Born In '60S Or '70S&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chemical is regulated under the Toxic Substances Control Act due to the potential risks of liver cancer, kidney cancer and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has also been linked to damage to the liver, kidneys, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/nervous-system-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:central nervous system;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;central nervous system&lt;/a&gt;, immune system and reproductive organs, as well as fetal heart defects, per the EPA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS/mvaj7wvj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Read On The Fox News App;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Read On The Fox News App&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;A common chemical that’s widespread in the U.S. has been linked to an increased risk of Parkinson’s disease, researchers say.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has found that TCE, when inhaled or ingested, can easily cross the blood-brain barrier and cause damage to neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the most recent study, researchers from the Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, Ariz., analyzed data for nearly 222,000 &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/geriatric-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:older adults;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt;

and a genetic predisposition of susceptibility that leads to the development of Parkinson's disease," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Guy Schwartz, co-director of the Parkinson’s and Movement Disorders Center at Stony Brook Medicine on Long Island, New York, warned that TCE is "ubiquitous" in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;TCE is just one of many chemicals that has been associated with the development of Parkinson's disease.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is present in common, everyday life materials, such as perfumes, cleaning wipes, glue and ink, and in the manufacturing of soap, paper and plastics," Schwartz, who was also not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It also appears that TCE is present in air and soil, and exposure to it in minute amounts over many years — perhaps over decades — may be necessary to set in motion the biochemical cascade that leads to premature &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/brain-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:death of neurons;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;death of neurons&lt;/a&gt;, as is the case in Parkinson’s disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz pointed out, however, that TCE is not the only risk factor to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We shouldn’t discount the possibility that exposure to multiple neurotoxins results in the ‘perfect storm’ leading to disease onset," he said. "Some chemicals are better established than others, and more widely accepted in the medical community, but almost certainly there are others that have not been studied rigorously and potentially are even more deleterious &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:to our health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;to our health&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz noted that the study suggests Parkinson’s disease may be linked not only to advanced age, but also to the cumulative effects of long-term exposure to neurotoxins — which could help explain why the disease often develops later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding TCE exposure can be challenging, Ellenbogen noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is likely some benefit to using medical-grade air purifiers, filtering water and avoiding plastic water bottles, which may contribute to lowering risk," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Previous research has found that TCE, when inhaled or ingested, can easily cross the blood-brain barrier and cause damage to neurons.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher Krzyzanowski encourages individuals to be aware of the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:previous studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt; linking TCE exposure to Parkinson’s disease risk and to check to see whether the chemical has contaminated their own community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If so, there are ways to volunteer and get involved with community groups concerning environmental advocacy and remediation," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Health articles, visit ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:www.foxnews.com/health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was supported in part by the American Academy of Neurology and the Barrow Neurological Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to several manufacturers of TCE for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original article source:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/parkinsons-risk-could-increase-exposure-common-chemical-study-suggests" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parkinson’s risk could increase with exposure to common chemical, study suggests;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parkinson’s risk could increase with exposure to common chemical, study suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 08:33:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxNcElfYlpWYkxDT0ZWVTc0QkxRaDNKYXc3MTEyak5ZdjZaOXNHMzJfZUVxZlJYejdZSnVaRTdUZUdrZUdqcTliQUdlVllMZ1RhY1VrcmgxTjlGV2FqZTNQc1luZU1tRGFBYld3NHB0dmhMd09xaUZoV2lRSl9oam9JTUhLNkE</guid></item><item><title>中国一名男子在猪肝移植后存活超过170天，医生报告- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/health/pig-liver-transplant-china</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;
                
    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgick8ve000x27p31vreghde@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors in China say they transplanted a genetically modified pig liver into a 71-year-old man who lived 171 days after the procedure, and 38 of those days were with the pig organ in place – a first to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgicv29g00033b6q1y58ckxc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists have had early success transplanting genetically modified pig kidneys and hearts into humans, and pig livers have been transplanted into people who were brain-dead. But experts in the field of xenotransplantation – using animal organs in people – have had some concerns about whether the liver would be a good candidate for such a procedure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgigtkpi0000336nsja8xfki@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Everyone always says, ‘oh, liver is too complicated to transplant, compared to the heart or kidney,’ but after this, in the future, I think people will think differently. I think liver is good if we can get enough human genes in the pig,” said Dr. Beicheng Sun, president of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University and a co-author of the new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef40002336ncg1z0pse@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unlike hearts and kidneys that have more narrow functions, the liver is more complicated to replace with a pig organ because it’s large and has a dual blood supply and multiple functions. The liver filters blood, removes toxins and waste, processes nutrients, detoxifies harmful substances like alcohol and drugs, produces bile to help with digestion, produces proteins that help blood clot and plays an important role in regulating blood sugar.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Last year, doctors at &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2024/january/first-successful-external-liver-perfusion-using-a-porcine-liver" target="_blank"&gt;Penn Medicine&lt;/a&gt; did the world’s first known successful external liver perfusion using a gene-edited pig organ. Blood from a brain-dead patient circulated through a pig liver outside the person’s body. In that case, the pig liver showed no signs of inflammation in the 72 hours it was tested, and the patient’s body remained stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef4000a336nghtl25vv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A transplanted pig liver &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/health/pig-liver-human-transplant-china"&gt;given to a brain-dead patient&lt;/a&gt; in China in March 2024 was removed at their family’s request 10 days after surgery. There had been no signs of immune rejection or accumulation of inflammation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef40003336nlzvtv61h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say the new study, published Thursday in the Journal of Hepatology, suggests that pig-to-human liver transplantation shows promise for use as a bridge to help a human who has a serious liver condition live long enough for enough of their own liver to recover or for a donor human liver to became available.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgigxih90005336na8ie8t0a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In the future, maybe the left side can get a real chance to regenerate, and in that case, we would remove the graft, and that would be enough to support the life, or at least we know we can wait one or two months for a graft from a human that could save his life. I think this is a very key finding,” Sun said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef40004336nnmte972w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With more than 100,000 people on organ transplant waiting lists &lt;a href="https://unos.org/data/#:~:text=Improve.,of%20today%201:00pm%20EDT" target="_blank"&gt;in the US alone&lt;/a&gt; and more than 9,000 waiting for a liver transplant, the demand for human organs far outpaces the supply. Livers are the second biggest need after kidneys, &lt;a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics" target="_blank"&gt;according to the US Health Resources &amp;amp; Services Administration.&lt;/a&gt; Scientists have been exploring alternatives for decades, including using pig organs because of their similarity to human organs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef40005336nl0r450os@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the case described in the new paper, doctors at the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhul Medical University in China transplanted a liver from an 11-month-old pig into a 71-year-old man in May 2024. The pig, a clone, had 10 gene edits to reduce the possibility of infection or rejection of the organ. Doctors also gave the man drugs to suppress his immune system to keep his body from rejecting the foreign organ.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef40006336ncojz3vhi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The man had initially been hospitalized for hepatitis B-related cirrhosis, a condition in which scar tissue replaces healthy tissue, impairing the function of the liver and sometimes leading to liver failure. He also had a large tumor in the right lobe of his liver, but efforts to shrink the tumor with a high concentration of chemotherapy targeted to its blood supply were unsuccessful.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgid4zkn00053b6qmqtyb50m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In some cases like this, surgeons can surgically remove a part of the liver, but the researchers behind the new study said that what was left of the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;man’s liver would probably have been too small to meet his metabolic needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef40007336ne78kkaii@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After almost three weeks in the hospital, the man developed severe abdominal pain, and tests showed that the tumor was in danger of rupturing. Doctors tested family members to see whether they could donate liver tissue, but no one was a good match, so a gene-edited pig liver was considered the only remaining option that could save the man’s life. He and his daughter discussed the experiment with the doctors and agreed to proceed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgihofta000e336nturyge22@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We need to have great respect for this patient and their family,” Sun said. “The patient provides such a special contribution to the field of this science, and we need to be grateful for all of these patients who have made such a big contribution to this field.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef40008336n53gt4wae@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors removed the tumor and the transplanted the genetically modified pig liver onto&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;what was left of the man’s liver.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef40009336nuecfnzxo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The transplant seemed successful. Right away, the pig liver turned red, and bile – which helps remove waste products and aids in the absorption of fats – started draining from the external bile duct, with secretion progressively increasing over time. Within the first day, there was a significant increase in other liver function indicators, and there were no initial signs of inflammation or rejection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgide7xv00093b6quy24dri7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There were no signs of acute rejection in the man’s body at day 10 after the surgery, the researchers say. Rather, what remained of the left side of the man’s liver seemed to be performing better than it had pre-surgery. An ultrasound showed that the portal vein, hepatic artery and hepatic vein blood flow in the transplanted pig liver were performing normally.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef4000c336najg95uhe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But by day 25, the patient’s heart started showing progressive signs of stress. Tests on day 28 and 33 showed inflammatory changes related to the transplant, and doctors swapped out some of the immune-weakening drugs. But there were other signs that the transplant wasn’t working as well as it did at first, suggesting that the man had developed a condition called xenotransplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy, in which microscopic blood clots damage small blood vessels and organs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef4000d336nmh98gy7b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On day 37, the man’s blood pressure plummeted and his heart rate increased, and he was in and out of consciousness. At that point, his own liver was considered capable of functioning enough to keep his body going, so doctors removed the pig organ on day 38. The man’s liver continued to function well afterward.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgidvv46000k3b6qwqauez0d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On day 135, the man developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and he died of this bleeding 171 days after the transplant procedure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef4000e336ndzuceb9s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study authors say the research gave them critical insight into the challenges and the feasibility of such a transplant. It showed that pig-to-human liver transplantation “can provide effective hepatic support while preserving part of the native liver, confirming its clinical feasibility as a bridging strategy,” they wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef4000f336nqvpdcevq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Heiner Wedemeyer, a professor and chairman of the Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Infectious Diseases and Endocrinology at Hannover Medical School in Germany who co-authored an editorial that was published alongside the study Thursday, wrote that the experiment showed “a cause for cautious optimism” as well as a “reminder of how far the field must still travel.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef4000g336nnn4ee1zc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s really groundbreaking,” Wedemeyer told CNN. “For me as a transplant hepatologist, it really opens completely new views and ideas.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgih79m8000b336nqz5m4dey@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Wedemeyer said he saw a patient Wednesday morning who had acute liver failure and did not qualify for transplantation with a human organ because of some cancer issues.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgii4cp0000r3b6qirge4on9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If I would have had, at this stage, use of a pig liver to bridge her – because she may need three, four, five, six, seven weeks to recover with her own liver – I would have done this,” he said. “A pig liver gives us completely new opportunities, and that can really be promising for our patients.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

But beyond its rich aroma and flavour, how you brew your coffee can make a big difference to its health impact. According to researchers from Harvard, certain brewing methods may help you enjoy all the benefits of coffee, such as improved alertness, metabolism, and heart health, while reducing potential risks linked to cholesterol and overconsumption. Among these, filtered coffee stands out as the healthiest option, helping retain coffee’s antioxidants while removing compounds that could otherwise raise LDL cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Coffee’s real health benefits and risks&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many people, coffee is an essential part of the morning routine. However, it has long carried a mixed reputation. Some worry that drinking coffee can lead to restlessness, increased heart rate, or poor sleep. These effects are mainly due to excessive caffeine intake or sugary additions, not the coffee itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When consumed in moderation, coffee can actually offer several health benefits. It contains powerful antioxidants that protect the body’s cells from oxidative stress, a process linked to ageing and chronic diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies suggest that coffee may lower the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. It also helps improve alertness, focus, and metabolism, making it a great natural energy booster. Additionally, moderate coffee intake has been linked to improved liver function, reduced inflammation, and enhanced mood regulation, contributing to overall mental well-being and long-term metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, balance is key. Too much caffeine can cause jitteriness, anxiety, or disrupted sleep. People sensitive to caffeine should limit intake or avoid drinking it late in the day. Similarly, adding sugar, syrups, or heavy cream can turn a healthy beverage into a high-calorie drink, undoing many of its natural benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Harvard says filtered coffee is the healthiest choice&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/whats-the-healthiest-way-to-brew-coffee?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Harvard Health Publishing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, the healthiest way to drink coffee is by brewing it with a paper filter. This method retains coffee’s beneficial compounds while removing certain oils, known as cafestol and kahweol, that are naturally present in unfiltered coffee. These oils, when consumed regularly, can raise LDL (bad) cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brewing coffee using a drip machine, pour-over, or percolator with a filter helps trap these substances, producing a smoother and healthier drink. In contrast, unfiltered methods such as espresso, French press, or Turkish coffee allow these compounds to pass through, potentially impacting heart health over time. Filtered coffee also reduces the presence of cafestol and kahweol, compounds that can raise cholesterol levels, making it a better choice for regular consumption, especially for individuals concerned about cardiovascular health or managing elevated cholesterol. It’s a simple, effective change that offers long-term benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The best way to enjoy coffee in moderation&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research highlights that moderation is just as important as preparation. Drinking around three to four cups of filtered coffee per day appears to offer the most health benefits without significant drawbacks. This level provides a good balance of antioxidants and energy while minimising the risks associated with too much caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also best to enjoy coffee without heavy cream, sugar, or flavoured syrups. These additions can lead to unnecessary calories, sugar spikes, and inflammation, which counteract the protective effects of coffee’s antioxidants. For a healthier version, try drinking it black, with a splash of milk, or using natural sweeteners like cinnamon or a small amount of honey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Smarter brewing for a healthier cup&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee can be a nourishing part of a balanced diet when brewed and consumed wisely. Choosing filtered coffee is the easiest way to reduce harmful compounds while keeping the taste and energy boost intact. Pairing this habit with a nutrient-rich diet and proper hydration further enhances coffee’s positive effects on health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if you love your morning cup, there’s no need to give it up, just brew it smarter. Use a paper filter, limit sugar, and enjoy your coffee in moderation. With these small changes, your daily ritual can become a heart-healthy and antioxidant-rich habit that supports your overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

It's a possibility explored in a new study of 20 common bottlenose dolphins (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bottlenose_dolphin"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tursiops truncatus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) stranded in the Indian River Lagoon, Florida, between 2010 and 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the researchers behind the study have linked the signs of dolphin neurodegeneration to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/climate-change" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73046" data-postid="176885" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; – via &lt;a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/hazards/hab/"&gt;toxic blooms of algae&lt;/a&gt; and bacteria that are becoming more frequent and widespread in warmer waters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis of the brains of the stranded dolphins revealed changes to gene expression that are associated with Alzheimer's in humans, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-key-alzheimers-pathway-and-blocking-it-reverses-symptoms-in-mice"&gt;damage typical&lt;/a&gt; of the disease, like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sky-high-levels-of-alzheimers-protein-found-in-newborns"&gt;clumped proteins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fat-buildup-in-brain-cells-could-provide-new-target-for-alzheimers-treatment"&gt;Fat Buildup in Brain Cells Could Provide New Target For Alzheimer's Treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a significant difference in the dolphins stranded during algal bloom seasons though: Their brains showed levels of the neurotoxin 2,4-diaminobutyric acid (2,4-DAB) that were a whopping 2,900 times more concentrated than in other dolphins that beached themselves when no algal blooms were around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's evidence of the harmful effects of blooms filled with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanobacteria"&gt;cyanobacteria&lt;/a&gt;, and it could explain some of the loss of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-navigational-skills-are-intricately-linked-to-your-past-research-shows"&gt;navigational skills&lt;/a&gt; and memory that would lead these dolphins to become stranded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_176888" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176888" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/AlgalBloom.jpg" alt="Algal bloom diagram" class="wp-image-176888 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/AlgalBloom.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/AlgalBloom-600x362.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-176888" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers linked algal blooms with dolphin brain damage. (Durden et al., &lt;em&gt;Comms. Biol.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since dolphins are considered environmental sentinels for toxic exposures in marine environments, there are concerns about human health issues associated with cyanobacterial blooms," &lt;a href="https://brainchemistrylabs.org/news-blog/2025/10/1/do-stranded-dolphins-have-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; toxicologist David Davis, from the University of Miami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For context, it's important to note that dolphins normally develop brain problems that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.15900"&gt;look a lot like Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; as they get older. We also know that toxins given off by cyanobacteria &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2010.05.002"&gt;can harm neurons&lt;/a&gt; in animals and people, though links to human neurodegenerative diseases are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10937404.2017.1297592"&gt;still under investigation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suggestion the team is making now is that these problems might be accelerated and made worse in dolphins &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/exposure-to-algae-toxin-increases-the-risk-of-alzheimers-like-illnesses-52981"&gt;by harmful algal blooms&lt;/a&gt;. The study adds details on the neurotoxins doing the damage, the key consequences in the dolphin brains, and the seasonal variations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The co-occurrence of Alzheimer's disease neuropathological changes and the natural accumulation of algal toxins observed in dolphins allows a unique opportunity to study the impact of these two converging events on the brain," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-08796-0"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risks aren't just limited to dolphins, either: these blooms &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134068"&gt;are causing harm&lt;/a&gt; to plenty of other kinds of marine life, which then has knock-on effects going up the food chain, leading eventually to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past research has &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/algae-that-can-cause-memory-loss-found-lurking-in-seafood"&gt;already linked&lt;/a&gt; algal blooms to toxins that can lead to memory loss, which is of course a key characteristic of Alzheimer's. If these chemicals get into our food in large enough amounts, that could be a serious problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study looks at dolphins and not humans, but some of the fundamental, Alzheimer's-like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newly-identified-proteins-may-explain-devastating-effects-of-alzheimers"&gt;shifts in the brain&lt;/a&gt; are the same, the researchers note. There's no direct link yet, but the signs are there, and that's at least worthy of further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the same researchers have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0404926101"&gt;previously looked at&lt;/a&gt; cyanobacteria and the neurotoxins they produce in cycad trees, finding that these toxins can persist in the environment and can accumulate up the food chain. That's a potential pathway where exposure to these toxins might lead to different types of neurodegeneration in human beings, including dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although there are likely many paths to Alzheimer's disease, cyanobacterial exposures increasingly appear to be a risk factor," &lt;a href="https://brainchemistrylabs.org/news-blog/2025/10/1/do-stranded-dolphins-have-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-08796-0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Communication Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When humanity ventures out into the final frontier, we won't be alone. &lt;a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/1925483/possible-alien-origins-mysterious-object/" target="_blank"&gt;I'm not talking about extraterrestrial life&lt;/a&gt;, but the Earth-based life that we'll bring with us. Russia returned a research satellite last week that was carrying 75 mice, over 1,500 flies, microorganisms, plant seeds and cell cultures. The Bion-M No. 2 satellite was launched in August to conduct over 30 experiments in low Earth orbit, furthering our understanding of how life functions in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The mission, a joint effort between Roscosmos and Russia's Institute of Biomedical Problems, concluded with a landing in the steppes of the Orenburg region. &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/space-exploration/russian-noahs-ark-probe-carrying-75-mice-and-1-500-flies-lands-back-on-earth" target="_blank"&gt;According to Space.com,&lt;/a&gt; the descent module was nicknamed Noah's Ark because of how it was stuffed with animal life. The scorching hot capsule sparked a brush fire, but it was quickly extinguished so scientists could retrieve their experiments on-site. Unlike early Soviet spaceflights with animals, most famously Laika, this ark needed to return to Earth with living occupants. Unfortunately, ten mice didn't survive the mission. Specialists assessed whether the flies onboard had sustained damage to their nervous systems after the trip to space.&lt;/p&gt;

				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;While the space zoo would imply that the experiments were conducted solely for animal research, the work done was intended to assist future long-term human space trips. Experiments aimed to develop life support systems that can endure both prolonged weightlessness and cosmic radiation and improve the radiation safety of crewed spacecraft. However, one of the experiments on the spacecraft sought to test the theory of panspermia. The unproven theory posits that all of life on Earth was brought here as bacteria riding asteroids. The experiment itself involved testing whether bacteria on basalt rocks could survive atmospheric re-entry. The results have yet to be revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spaceflight may never be boring, but it's in a rough place at the moment. Roscosmos is a shadow of its former self, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine &lt;a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/1842246/us-blocks-countries-rival-moon-base-project-china-claim/" target="_blank"&gt;crushing the country's ability to collaborate&lt;/a&gt; with Western institutions. The race to return to the Moon is quickly becoming a one-horse affair as &lt;a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/1855263/trump-6-billion-nasa-funding-cut-jeopardizes-china-moon-race/" target="_blank"&gt;the Trump administration has laid off thousands of NASA's employees and canceled already paid-for missions.&lt;/a&gt; The China Manned Space Agency is now positioned to be the first to establish a permanent human presence on the Moon, immediately making China the world's preeminent space power.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

    
&lt;/article&gt;

A mix of enteroviruses is known to spread every year, primarily in the late summer and early fall, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/index.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease physician at UCSF, told SFGATE that most people end up with cases that are mild and include runny nose and cough. In some rare cases, the virus can infect the protective covering around the spinal cord and brain, causing meningitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We see a lot of patients in the hospital who come in, they’ll have a headache, will do a lumbar puncture … and they’ll actually have enterovirus in there,” Gandhi said. She explained that when people develop meningitis related to enterovirus it is often much more mild than bacterial meningitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re “totally functional, you know, but they’ll have a mild headache,” Gandhi said of these patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with severe symptoms can end up hospitalized for respiratory therapy. One especially frightening effect of enterovirus D68 is a potentially dangerous neurological condition called acute flaccid myelitis. In this case, the person affected, usually a child, develops serious &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/enterovirus/spread-enterovirus-d68-linked-polio-illness-may-have-risen-50-over-10-years" data-link="native" class=""&gt;“polio-like” symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, including muscle weakness that can lead to permanent paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can be very scary, but it’s very rare,” Gandhi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no vaccine to protect against the enterovirus D68 and no cure. Most commonly, enterovirus D68 affects children, who may not have been exposed to the virus before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re seeing things for the first time,” Gandhi said of young children likely to develop the disease. “Also because they’re in day care, they’re around other children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SFGATE</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 22:54:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNS1pGRWFGRUxTdU9vVVdVV2xwVWNrNWRGdzN4TWlra2Q5bTV3Ykl3Ml9OOXFaR3lmRk9KQ3NkS0h3SWpkYlowSDNfS3hVS25fdTRzZlVaalhMTlBPdm14N1hXOG55RzJZNUZrWUY4MW5UT1ZraEhkS1NtNjNtU3dGbE9MUnpSTkk</guid></item><item><title>她发现空气污染和不孕症之间存在联系-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/climate/mahalingaiah-air-pollution-infertility.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 22:46:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxPdVJkMEVVelpnX3hFdXo1R2RPZEhyU0RDMWhtaDFXOWpMeV9KN0c0ZlZiN1pydmdlWjBraEhhUGFjUUExbi1FbmV1NTRxeE9aQ0ZSOXpaTk9xVDVvYU1adERCME5oZHpXZ3VncjJPUS1BbC1hWk1ldEJGZmg2bW9SQjVVYUF3Z2xfLXR0MTR3cw</guid></item><item><title>男人喝醉了，醒来时发现了一个医学谜团，差点杀了他- Ars Technica</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/10/man-gets-drunk-wakes-up-with-a-medical-mystery-that-nearly-kills-him/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-content-double"&gt;
          
          
&lt;p&gt;And what about the lungs? A number of things could explain the problems in his lungs—including infections from soil bacteria he might encounter in his construction work or a parasitic infection found in Central America. But the cause that best fit was common pneumonia and, more specifically, based on the distribution of opacities in his lung, pneumonia caused by aspiration (inhaling food particles or other things that are not air)—which is something that can happen when people drink excessive amounts of alcohol, as the man regularly did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ethanol impairs consciousness and blunts protective reflexes (e.g., cough and gag), which disrupts the normal control mechanisms of the upper aerodigestive tract," Dhaliwal noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is where Dhaliwal made a critical connection. If the man's drinking led him to develop aspiration pneumonia—accidentally getting food in his lungs—he may have also accidentally gotten nonfood in this gastrointestinal tract at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Critical connection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things people most commonly swallow by accident include coins, button batteries, jewelry, and small bones. But these things tend to show up in imaging, and none of the imaging revealed a swallowed object. Things that don't show up on images, though, are things made of plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This reasoning leads to the search for an organic object that might be ingested while eating and drinking and is seemingly harmless but becomes invasive upon entering the gastrointestinal tract," Dhaliwal wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The leading suspect," he concluded, "is a wooden toothpick—an object commonly found in club sandwiches and used for dental hygiene. Toothpick ingestions often go unnoticed, but once identified, they are considered medical emergencies owing to their propensity to cause visceral perforation and vascular injury."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a toothpick had pierced the man's duodenum, it would completely explain of all the man's symptoms. He drank too much and lost control of his aerodigestive tract, leading to aspiration that caused pneumonia, and he then swallowed a toothpick, which perforated the duodenum and led to sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dhaliwal recommended an endoscopic procedure to look for a toothpick in his intestines. On the man's third day in the hospital, he had the procedure, and, sure enough, there was a toothpick, piercing through his duodenum and into his right kidney, just as Dhaliwal had deduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors promptly removed it and treated the man with antibiotics. He went on to make a full recovery. At a nine-month follow-up, he continued to do well and had maintained abstinence from alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MISSOURI, USA — Three people have died and 15 have been hospitalized by &lt;a href="/article/news/nation-world/west-nile-virus-cases-running-higher-than-normal-health-warnings/507-4a4e49c2-26df-4375-aae6-508e755f266f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;West Nile Virus in Missouri&lt;/a&gt; as of Oct. 4, according to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 16 cases have been confirmed in the state, but more are under investigation. Health officials said virus levels are the highest the state has seen in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus is surging throughout the state and across the country, with &lt;a href="/article/news/nation-world/west-nile-virus-cases-running-higher-than-normal-health-warnings/507-4a4e49c2-26df-4375-aae6-508e755f266f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;cases running 40% higher than normal nationwide&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 770 cases, including 490 severe cases, were identified in early September, compared with the 550 cases, including 350 severe cases, usually reported during this time of year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“West Nile virus is a serious public health concern, and this year’s increase in cases is a reminder that we must remain vigilant,” said Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services State Epidemiologist George Turabelidze said in a press release on Wednesday. “We are asking all Missourians to take simple but effective steps to protect themselves and their families.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said West Nile Virus infections often cause no symptoms, but 1 in 5 people may develop a flu-like illness along with fever, headache, and body aches. Older individuals or people with weakened immune systems can also experience brain swelling or paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department shared the following ways people can protect themselves from the virus, including:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many people reach for a diet soda as a healthier choice, especially when compared to a regular, sugary drink. However, a new study suggests that both &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/diet-soda-diabetes-study-11752952" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;artificially sweetened drinks&lt;/a&gt; and their sugary counterparts could significantly increase your risk of developing a serious liver condition.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The condition in question is metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, or MASLD. Formerly known as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-doctors-recommend-to-do-first-masld-11723533" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nonalcoholic fatty liver disease&lt;/a&gt;, MASLD occurs when &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/having-diabetes-can-increase-your-risk-of-liver-disease-heres-what-you-can-do-to-help-8399481" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;excess fat builds up in the liver&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, this can lead to inflammation, scarring and severe liver damage. It has become the most common chronic liver disease globally, affecting an estimated 30% of adults in certain countries and is a growing cause of liver-related deaths.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With this in mind, understanding the risk factors, including what we drink, is more important than ever. To help add to what we know about beverages and liver disease risk, researchers shared these results at the United European Gastroenterology Week 2025 medical conference. Let’s unpack what they presented.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To investigate the link between sweetened drinks and liver disease, researchers conducted a large-scale, long-term study using data from the UK Biobank, a massive health resource. They followed more than 100,000 participants who had no signs of liver disease at the beginning of the study.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Over a median period of 10.3 years, these participants provided detailed information about their diets, including their consumption of both sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) like regular sodas and low- or non-sugar-sweetened beverages (LNSSBs), such as diet sodas. Researchers used this information to track who developed MASLD and who experienced other liver-related health issues.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study was designed to be thorough. By following a large group of people for over a decade, scientists could observe how beverage habits were associated with the risk of developing liver disease over time. They also used advanced imaging techniques to measure the actual fat content in the livers of some participants, adding another layer of concrete evidence to their findings.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study found that regular consumption of &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; types of drinks was linked to a greater risk of developing MASLD.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Specifically, individuals who consumed more than about one can (over 250 grams) per day of either diet or regular soda had an increased risk of being diagnosed with MASLD compared to those who drank them less frequently.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diet Drinks (LNSSBs):&lt;/strong&gt; Higher intake was associated with a 60% increased risk of developing MASLD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sugary Drinks (SSBs):&lt;/strong&gt; Higher intake was associated with a 50% increased risk of developing MASLD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Interestingly, the study revealed that diet drinks were not the “safer” option when it comes to liver health. In fact, their consumption was also linked to a higher risk of death from liver-related causes, an association not seen with sugary drinks in this particular study. Both beverage types were also directly linked to higher levels of fat accumulation in the liver.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lihe Liu, the lead author of the study, explained the potential reasons behind these findings. Sugary drinks can cause &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habits-that-can-spike-your-blood-sugar-11762553" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rapid spikes in blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; and insulin, which promotes weight gain and contributes to liver fat. Diet drinks, while free of sugar, may disrupt health in other ways. They may &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;alter the gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, interfere with feelings of fullness, and even stimulate a sweet craving that encourages unhealthier eating habits. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While this study provides important insights into the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7964257/this-is-what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-drink-diet-soda/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;relationship between both sugary and diet soda consumption&lt;/a&gt; and liver disease risk, it’s important to keep a few limitations in mind. First, the research relied on self-reported dietary information, which can sometimes be inaccurate due to memory lapses or unintentional misreporting by participants. This means actual beverage intake might differ from what was recorded.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, the study was observational in nature. This type of research can uncover associations between behaviors and health outcomes, but it cannot definitively prove that drinking diet or sugary sodas causes liver disease. Other factors not fully captured in the study, such as lifestyle choices or genetic predispositions, might also play a role.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When defining diet sodas, the researchers did not indicate which sweetener was used as an ingredient. Since some data suggests that certain &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/are-artificial-sweeteners-bad-for-you-8431961" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nonnutritive sweeteners&lt;/a&gt; (like sucralose) were not significantly broken down in the gut and didn't cause major changes to the microbial environment, different diet sodas made with different sweeteners may have a different impact on liver health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Lastly, more research is needed to fully understand the underlying biological mechanisms and to confirm these results. Future studies, including long-term randomized controlled trials, will help clarify whether removing sweetened sodas from the diet directly reduces liver disease risk or if other factors are at play.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The conclusions from this study offer clear and practical advice for daily life. The common perception of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bad-drink-thats-better-than-the-healthier-version-11752384" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diet sodas as a healthy alternative&lt;/a&gt; might not be a wise presumption, especially if you’re concerned about your liver health already.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The key takeaway is that limiting your intake of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; sweetened beverages—whether artificially sweetened or sweetened with sugar—may be the best approach for your liver. Based on this observational data, the study found that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/diet-soda-diabetes-study-11752952" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;substituting one can of either a sugary or diet soda&lt;/a&gt; with a glass of water each day significantly reduced the risk of developing MASLD:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Replacing a sugary drink with water lowered the risk by about 13%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Replacing a diet drink with water lowered the risk by about 15%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Simply switching from regular soda to diet soda, however, offered no reduction in risk. This suggests that the problem lies with the sweet drinks themselves, not just the sugar content. However, until stronger data is available, we can not definitively say that drinking diet soda will cause liver health concerns.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_49-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’d like to start drinking fewer diet sodas, that doesn’t mean you have to stick to water entirely. You might also consider opting for &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8040739/grapefruit-soda/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sparkling water with a splash of juice&lt;/a&gt;, having iced green tea or enjoying an unsweetened carbonated drink, like a LaCroix.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This comprehensive study shared at the United European Gastroenterology Week 2025 medical conference provides evidence that both sugary and artificially sweetened drinks may pose a risk to your liver health. As metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) becomes an increasingly widespread global health issue, making informed choices about what we drink could be a powerful step toward prevention.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While sugary drinks have been under scrutiny for years, this research places diet drinks in the same category of concern. By cutting back on both regular and diet sodas and opting for water or other unsweetened drinks, you may actively reduce your risk of developing liver disease and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-habit-to-break-for-better-metabolic-health-8751700" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support your overall metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="144" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgicd4wk000gg2j8gg0bt1g9@published"&gt;Here’s what I have to say about the common cold: It sucks. The symptoms are uncomfortable, and they can come for you &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/colds"&gt;multiple times&lt;/a&gt; a year. If you’re lucky enough to not get &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;sick, you get the unique misery of getting all your normal work done while buried under a mountain of tissues and the mental refrain &lt;em&gt;How did I ever forget how wonderful life is when you don’t have a runny nose? &lt;/em&gt;The common cold isn’t just a nuisance, though. It carries significant economic effects, causing an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/215118"&gt;estimated $40 billion in losses&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. each year from health care costs and missed work days. And for many people with underlying respiratory illnesses like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, aka COPD, it poses a serious threat in the same way that flu, COVID, and pneumonia are more deadly in vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8y9001n3b78img45pup@published"&gt;Despite regularly meeting the cold on the front lines, we have relatively few weapons to fight it. There’s a litany of cough syrups, but &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40272-020-00420-4"&gt;many are outright ineffective&lt;/a&gt;. Vitamin C &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/myths-and-truths-about-vitamin-c"&gt;shorten the length&lt;/a&gt; of a cold, but it won’t prevent one. Antibiotics do nothing to fight viruses (and they do lead to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/well/antibiotic-resistance.html"&gt;antibacterial resistance&lt;/a&gt;). And, of course, there’s no cold vaccine, while you can go get a protective flu or COVID jab when fall weather rolls around. All you can really do is wash your hands a lot and prepare to grit your teeth through the eventual infection.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="81" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8y9001o3b78rp3likn0@published"&gt;Why are we so ill-prepared for the common cold? It’s not because the common cold has been neglected by scientists or vaccine manufacturers, but because it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/06/why-cant-we-cure-the-common-cold"&gt;actually a really wily opponent&lt;/a&gt;. If researchers in the field “thought that a vaccine was something that could be achieved, they would already have done it,” says Sebastian Johnston, a professor of respiratory medicine and allergy at the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College London and a world expert in respiratory medicine research.&lt;/p&gt;

And he thinks we’re close(ish) to the next step. I reached out to him to learn the latest. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="21" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8ya001q3b7837vugs5a@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slate: Can you give us a little background as to why the common cold is a particularly difficult nut to crack?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8ya001r3b781qs4pbon@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sebastian Johnston:&lt;/strong&gt; The basic reason is the sheer number of different viruses that cause common colds. Pretty much any respiratory virus can cause a common cold. Some of those already do have vaccines, like influenza, COVID, and RSV. But they’re generally reserved for more vulnerable populations, like older people and people with comorbid conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8ya001s3b782fy2wz48@published"&gt;While any respiratory virus can cause a common cold, the biggest family are rhinoviruses—I would say probably three-quarters to four-fifths of common colds are caused by a rhinovirus infection. And the reason there is not a rhinovirus vaccine is because there are about 180 different rhinoviruses circulating, and they’re all distinct from each other. To get a vaccine that covers 180 different viruses is technologically extremely challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="11" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yb001t3b78mdwj4twm@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How have you been tackling that challenge in your own research?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yb001u3b78i1rfy850@published"&gt;Our aim has been to develop a vaccine that works through T-cells rather than antibodies. Humans have multiple arms of our immune systems that protect us against infections. Antibodies are very important, and producing antibodies against individual viruses is probably the most important thing that protects us against infections. But the problem with antibodies for rhinoviruses is that they don’t cross-react from one virus to another, so you’d need a vaccine with 180 different virus proteins in it to produce an effective antibody-producing virus.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yb001v3b787bocssg5@published"&gt;Then there are T cells, which are also part of the cellular immune response to infection. They have antiviral activity by themselves, but they also promote antibody production by stimulating the cells that produce antibodies. [We found that] if we promoted T-cell responses against rhinoviruses, that &lt;em&gt;would &lt;/em&gt;cross-react among all 180 different rhinoviruses, and they would both have antiviral activity through the T cells themselves and also boost antibody production against those viruses through the T cells.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="10" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yb001w3b783j2ckttt@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sounds like a good idea to me! Has it worked?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  




  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yb001x3b785yfr5wyt@published"&gt;What we’ve shown in mice and monkeys is that you can induce T-cell immune responses to a broad range of rhinoviruses—we’ve studied about 20 of them, which are pretty representative of the entire 180—and get very strong immune responses. We boost antibody production, and we clear virus faster. So everything that we’re seeing in mice and monkeys is telling us that it ought to work in man. But we haven’t yet shown that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="4" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yc001y3b787x07p9ox@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will that entail?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="156" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yc001z3b78zja510sd@published"&gt;We’re working with &lt;a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/247454/apollo-therapeutics-raises-2265m-develop-medicines/"&gt;Apollo Therapeutics&lt;/a&gt;, who are committed to going into safety testing and then seeing whether it works in people by doing clinical trials. We hope that those studies will start later this year or early next year. We’re going to start with people with a chronic lung disease called COPD, because when they get a rhinovirus infection, they frequently end up in hospital, and so the cost [to the health care system] is obviously much higher than people getting common colds. If it’s successful in COPD, we would probably then broaden it to other chronic respiratory diseases like asthma and other chronic lung diseases. If it’s successful in those, we’ll probably broaden it to older people and immunosuppressed populations. And eventually, if it’s very safe and the cost has come down sufficiently to justify using it for the common cold, I see no reason why it shouldn’t eventually be used for the common cold.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="7" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yd00203b780ks2icbj@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any idea how long that could take?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yd00213b7858lbupy4@published"&gt;Once Apollo has done their safety tests, they would then commit to testing whether it works or not, and we would probably look to get an answer a couple of years down the line. They’re quite long-duration studies, because you have to wait for naturally occurring colds to happen in the population that you’re studying. And then from there it usually does take some years to manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;

Has that sped up the prospect of a rhinovirus vaccine at all?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yd00233b78tvvb7b7r@published"&gt;It did give a boost. But it hasn’t changed what we’re doing in any major way. We did look at developing an mRNA vaccine for rhinoviruses, but in the end, we decided to go with a protein vaccine with an adjuvant. That’s the standard approach for most vaccines, because the antibody responses that you get are actually stronger with a protein and an adjuvant than with an mRNA.&lt;/p&gt;

Has that affected your work at all?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yd00253b78fgq9vi9j@published"&gt;It hasn’t touched the UK in the same way, but a lot of drug development occurs in the United States, and a lot of clinical trial centers are in the United States, so I expect it has impacted Apollo’s thinking about where they want to do their studies. Obviously we don’t consider it to be a good thing. But there’s not much we can do to influence it at the moment, other than provide good data showing that it works. That’s the best answer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8ye00273b782zfdv5kc@published"&gt;Developing antivirals is something that many companies have tried, but so far, there is not a rhinovirus antiviral that is licensed and available for use. There was one that got quite a long way, but unfortunately it was found to interact with other drugs, and ultimately it was not approved.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="101" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8ye00283b783d74ppoa@published"&gt;There is another drug called &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/altesa-biosciences-details-positive-topline-vapendavir-results-from-phase-2-placebo-controlled-rhinovirus-challenge-study-in-copd-patients-302448650.html"&gt;Vapendavir&lt;/a&gt; that looks promising. We recently carried out a study giving rhinovirus infection to people with COPD to induce a worsening of their COPD—so, mimicking the attacks that happen in the natural setting—and I’m happy to say that it gave positive results. We reduced symptom severity; we sped up time to recovery; we reduced virus loads; we showed reduced inflammation in markers of inflammation in the blood; and we improved lung function. So all of those were positive outcomes, and the company that licensed it is currently looking for investment to do a large clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yf002a3b78jxrdiibk@published"&gt;To be honest, I do nothing. I’m lucky that I’ve got, I think, good antiviral immunity—most of my colds are mild. But if I had a significant cold, I’d take some &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/paracetamol.html"&gt;paracetamol&lt;/a&gt;. And if I were a vulnerable person who got ill, I would take &lt;a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/news/2024/07/overcounter-nasal-sprays-could-keep-colds-and-flu-at-bay-study-finds.page"&gt;First Defence&lt;/a&gt;, or one of those sprays that has been shown to shorten the illness duration by about a day, because that’s better than another day being ill.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yg002b3b78a3sbc7hq@published"&gt;Also, echinacea is a pretty harmless herbal treatment that does appear to have significant protection. I started off pretty skeptical about echinacea, but actually, I’m an author on studies showing that echinacea &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40001-021-00499-6"&gt;reduces antibiotic usage by about 70 percent in children&lt;/a&gt; if they use it as a prophylaxis. Antibiotic use is driven largely by common colds, which produce secondary bacterial things like sore throat, earache, nasal congestion, sinusitis.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m wishing things could move a little faster, because I’m confident that things are developing in the right way, and that we will have a vaccine and treatments for rhinoviruses and other common cold viruses before too &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;long.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to strengthening the muscles, lungs, and heart, regular physical exercise also strengthens the immune system. This finding comes from a study of older adults with a history of endurance training, which involves prolonged physical activity such as long-distance running, cycling, swimming, rowing, and walking.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;An international team of researchers analyzed the defense cells of these individuals and found that "natural killer" cells, which patrol the body against viruses and diseased cells, were more adaptable, less inflammatory, and metabolically more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-06057-y" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/i&gt;, investigated natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells are a type of white blood cell (lymphocyte) that can destroy infected and diseased cells, including cancer cells. They are at the forefront of the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; because they detect and fight viruses and other pathogens. The researchers analyzed the cells of nine individuals with an average age of 64, divided into two groups: untrained and trained in endurance exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In a previous study, we found that obesity and a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/sedentary+lifestyle/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;sedentary lifestyle&lt;/a&gt; can trigger a process of premature aging of defense cells. This made us want to investigate the other side of the story; that is, whether an older adult who has been practicing endurance exercises for more than 20 years may have a better-prepared immune system. And that's indeed what we found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In these individuals, NK cells functioned better in the face of an inflammatory challenge, in addition to using energy more efficiently. Therefore, it's as if exercise also trains the immune system," says Luciele Minuzzi, a visiting researcher at Justus Liebig University Giessen (JLU) in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is the result of Minuzzi's postdoctoral research and is part of a larger research project led by São Paulo State University (UNESP) researchers in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the study's findings, regular endurance training modulates the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/inflammatory+response/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;inflammatory response&lt;/a&gt; over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When we compared the cells of trained older adults with those of non-athletes of the same age, we found that those with a history of endurance exercise had fewer inflammatory markers and more anti-inflammatory markers. This means that compared to non-athletic older adults, they had much better control of inflammation," says Fábio Lira, a professor at the Faculty of Science and Technology (FCT-UNESP), Presidente Prudente campus, and project coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lira points out that the immune system can be influenced by several factors, such as sleep quality, diet, and vaccination, as well as stress, a sedentary lifestyle, and the use of immunosuppressive drugs, which reduce the activity of defense cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Physical exercise is one of these factors that can benefit the immune system, and in this research project, we're investigating how it can modulate the immune response over time," he says.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Changes in the cell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to analyzing the phenotype, function, and mitochondrial metabolism of NK cells in response to inflammatory stimuli, the researchers exposed expanded NK cells from trained and untrained older adults to different pharmacological blockers, such as propranolol and rapamycin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Trained older individuals demonstrate more efficient and adaptable immunity, with greater metabolic control and less propensity for cellular exhaustion. Regular physical exercise appears to positively modulate both adrenergic sensitivity and cellular energy sensors, promoting a more balanced and less inflammatory response to external stimuli," says Minuzzi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Propranolol is a drug that blocks the adrenergic pathway, the neural and endocrine circuit that releases neurotransmitters such as adrenaline and noradrenaline. It was used to isolate the role of this activation/mobilization pathway in NK cells. Rapamycin, on the other hand, inhibits the mTORC1 signaling pathway, which is related to the control of cell growth and proliferation. In the study, rapamycin altered the phenotype of NK cells and decreased their expansion in vitro at high doses (100 ng/mL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In both cases, even with the blocking of signaling pathways, the NK cells of the trained older adults were able to maintain their immune function, while the cells of the untrained individuals showed cellular exhaustion or failure in the inflammatory response. This means that long-term endurance training is associated with protective 'immunometabolic' adaptations in NK cells in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In other words, the cells become more mature and effective, less senescent, and metabolically better prepared to respond to inflammatory or pharmacological stressors," says Minuzzi.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Inflammatory response&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1601405/full" target="_blank"&gt;another recent study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;i&gt;Frontiers in Immunology&lt;/i&gt;, the same group of researchers had compared the immune response of young and master athletes before and after an acute exercise session. To do this, they analyzed whole blood and PBMC (the mononuclear fraction of blood formed by lymphocytes and monocytes, which includes NK cells) data from 12 master athletes (with an average age of 52 and more than 20 years of continuous training) and compared it with data from young athletes (with an average age of 22 and more than four years dedicated to training).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the master athletes had a more controlled inflammatory response than the younger athletes. When their blood cells were stimulated with a pathogen (LPS), both groups produced more IL-6, a cytokine that signals inflammation. However, the increase was more pronounced in young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Another important inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, was only increased in the younger group," says the researcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/young+athletes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;young athletes&lt;/a&gt; showed a more intense inflammatory response, while the older athletes showed a more regulated and controlled profile. According to the researchers, this suggests that lifelong training can promote beneficial, balanced immune adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Because they train regularly, their bodies are accustomed to dealing with inflammatory episodes, which require more intense stimuli to generate significant long-term inflammatory responses. It's this type of 'training' that—over time—adapts the immune system, making it stronger," she explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minuzzi points out that research on immune cells in athletes with a long training history has once again shown that decades of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; seem to "train" the regulation of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The system doesn't stop responding, but it avoids exaggeration. This is particularly interesting for a greater understanding of healthy aging since disordered inflammatory responses are linked to several chronic diseases," she concludes.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) has reported the state's first flu-related death of the season.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the NCDHHS said an adult in western North Carolina died from flu complications during the first week of October. Their name was not given in a release.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"This is a sad reminder that flu infections can be serious and, in some cases, even fatal," said State Epidemiologist Zack Moore, M.D, MPH. "We encourage everyone to take preventative measures against flu and other respiratory illnesses like getting your yearly flu shot, regularly washing hands, covering your cough and staying home when sick to avoid infecting others."&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;More people died from the flu and flu complications during the 2024-2025 season than any previous stretch since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. From Oct. 5, 2024, through September 2025, the state saw 544 people die from the virus. The national number of pediatric flu deaths (280) was also the highest recorded amount since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Last week, a new law went into effect&lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/news/local/flu-pharmacy-no-prescription-nc-october-2025/"&gt; that allows pharmacists to test and treat the flu without the obligation of needing a prescription&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

She illuminates the evolutionary mechanisms underlying cooperation between species as well as the role of plant-microbe mutualisms in ecosystem health. Kiers’s research shows that microbes are not passive accessories to plants but powerful actors in their own right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early work, Kiers demonstrated how legumes punish cheater or noncooperative bacteria. Leguminous plants rely on rhizobia bacteria in root nodules to fix or convert nitrogen gas into a form the plant can access. In experiments, Kiers used a nitrogen-free environment to force rhizobia bacteria to cheat, showing that legumes withhold oxygen from noncooperative nodules and suffocate those bacteria that failed to provide resources to their hosts. In addition, the severity of the punishment correlates to the underperformance of the bacteria. Through this system of “sanctions,” legumes ensure rhizobial cooperation. Kiers’s subsequent work focused on tracking resource trade between plants and the mycorrhizal fungal partners that colonize their root systems. About 80 percent of plants get essential nutrients from fungi; in return, plants supply fungi with carbon compounds necessary for fungal growth and survival. Kiers and a biophysics collaborator utilized tools like stable isotope probing; high-resolution, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08614-x"&gt;robotic imaging&lt;/a&gt;; and fluorescent quantum dots to follow the movement and transfer of nutrients across complex networks of roots and fungal hyphae (the branching structure of fungus). They tracked and manipulated the exchange of resources between plants and fungi and found a two-way system of trade analogous to a market economy. Plants and fungi maintain stable and fair resource exchange by sharing or withholding resources according to the trading partner’s performance. Kiers also demonstrated plants and fungi reward or punish trading partners with precision. Plants can allocate carbon to a specific fungus species even when multiple different species are closely intermingled within a single root. Likewise, fungi move nutrients in both directions along their hyphae to strategically manipulate carbon payoffs from plant partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, Kiers co-founded the &lt;a href="https://www.spun.earth/"&gt;Society for the Protection of Underground Networks&lt;/a&gt; (SPUN) to map and protect the Earth’s underground fungi. SPUN informs the public and policymakers about the importance of fungi to planetary health and advocates for conservation of fungal networks. Through SPUN, Kiers collaborates with local researchers around the world to map underground fungal communities and explore how human activity and climate change are impacting fungal biodiversity, the ability of fungi to draw carbon into soil, and agricultural productivity. Kiers is solving a longstanding evolutionary puzzle about how and why organisms cooperate in nature and protecting plant-fungal symbioses—one of the most important and widespread mutualisms on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;            &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MacArthur Foundation</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 19:18:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE4wM3BUN09jS056ZVZvUThzak94UFJKa296WVR4d3lKRXlKN3pOY1hmMzQ3NENEQTlqM0Fnd3lrWFFUdnJyd3M2ZHE5Z0F6Y2pueHFwQU92c1NVN0U5Um0tZ3F5aXNnQUpx</guid></item><item><title>社会推理可能是治愈精神分裂症的关键-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/social-skills-schizophrenia-29791/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Researchers have identified a brain function that could transform how schizophrenia is treated—by focusing on social inference, the ability to interpret social cues and intentions. The study found that strengthening this skill early can help young patients regain independence and prevent long-term cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than relying solely on memory or attention training, social inference programs using structured exercises and games may yield greater improvements in daily functioning. This breakthrough could lead to personalized, community-based treatments that help patients recover faster and reintegrate into society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Inference Focus:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers discovered that improving the brain’s ability to “read between the lines” in social situations boosts functional recovery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Intervention:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting this skill during the first stages of schizophrenia could prevent long-term disability.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Therapy Approach:&lt;/strong&gt; Structured social training programs may outperform traditional cognitive treatments focused on memory or attention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Case Western Reserve&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers at the Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences at Case Western Reserve University have discovered a target in brain function that could change how schizophrenia patients are treated.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been treating schizophrenia with a one-size-fits-all approach for decades,” said Jessica Wojtalik, an assistant professor at Case Western Reserve’s Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel School of Applied Social Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113286"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-schizophrenia-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-schizophrenia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-schizophrenia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-schizophrenia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-schizophrenia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-schizophrenia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-schizophrenia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-schizophrenia-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and chat bubbles." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-schizophrenia-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-schizophrenia-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-schizophrenia-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-schizophrenia-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-schizophrenia-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-schizophrenia-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/social-schizophrenia-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers found that teaching patients to better understand social cues through targeted training programs that consist of structured computer games or worksheets could be more effective than traditional approaches that focus only on memory and attention skills. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now we have a specific target that could help young patients get their lives back on track much faster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings were recently published in &lt;em&gt;Psychiatry Research.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most mental health problems, including schizophrenia, a serious mental health condition that affects how people think, feel and behave, start as teenagers—when their brains are still developing and can be easily damaged, according to the National Institute of Mental Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When mental illness occurs during this critical transition from childhood to adulthood, it can cause lifelong struggles in school, with friendships and controlling emotions and actions—problems that often last well into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main factor in determining whether patients can function in daily life is known as social inference skills—the ability to “read between the lines” in social situations. The researchers identified how this brain function can be targeted independently for treatment—and that early intervention during this critical window could prevent long-term damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think of social inference as your brain’s social detective work,” said the study’s lead researcher Anju Kotwani, a doctoral student at the Mandel School. “It’s how you figure out what someone really means when they say ‘fine’ in a certain tone or how you know when someone is being sarcastic versus serious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that teaching patients to better understand social cues through targeted training programs that consist of structured computer games or worksheets could be more effective than traditional approaches that focus only on memory and attention skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study of 102 patients revealed that social cognition—your brain’s ability to understand and navigate social interactions—acts as the crucial bridge between basic thinking abilities and functioning in daily life during the critical early stages of schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are calling for the development of social inference training programs for young people with early-stage schizophrenia be made available in their communities. “Addressing both thinking skills and social understanding offers the best hope for functional recovery in early schizophrenia,” said Kotwani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div

schizophrenia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social cognition is an established mediator between neurocognition and functional outcome in schizophrenia, but there is limited evidence for this model specifically in the early course, which is a critical window for intervention to reduce long-term disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to test the social cognition mediator model in the early course of schizophrenia and identify social cognitive subdomains that may have stronger indirect effects on the relationship between neurocognition and functional outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This secondary analysis utilized baseline cognitive and functional outcome data from a cognitive remediation trial for outpatients with early course schizophrenia (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 102).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A path analysis approach was used to compute mediation of social cognition (mediator; composite index and subdomain scores) on the relationship between neurocognition (predictor; composite index) and functional outcome (outcome; composite index). Significant positive associations were observed between neurocognition, social cognition, and functional outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As previously observed, the mediation effect of the social cognition composite was significant (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.042).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the seven social cognitive subdomains, only social inference (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) emerged as a significant mediator. Reverse mediation models (mediator; neurocognition) were non-significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results suggest that the impact of cognition on functional outcome in the early course occurs, in part, through the impact of neurocognition on social cognition, which subsequently influences functional outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, social inference is possibly an important treatment target of functional recovery in the early course of the condition, highlighting a potential future research direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings further support the provision of comprehensive cognitive remediation approaches to facilitate functional recovery.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 18:58:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE95SVFsOVkwdUlzaWxhLVZJSEltYm1nX1A1VFp1bFNsa1N6MUJEQXdfQmRNbnBBbmdZNXdBQ2Fock1BdFdabE1sOUY4aEJ4akZmMkEzNFV3YVJBTUFrdEFRSHhNbDRRZnBYVUwxb19SV0s</guid></item><item><title>美国鲜为人知的乳腺癌激增，报告警告-新闻周刊</title><link>https://www.newsweek.com/lesser-known-breast-cancer-surging-in-us-report-warns-10847301</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="PostContent_articleBody__FR8Mb"&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;A lesser-known type of breast cancer is on the rise among women in the U.S.—highlighting the need for us to pay closer attention to it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;An estimated 33,600 women will be diagnosed with lobular breast cancer or invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) this year, according to new projections by the American Cancer Society (ACS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;The report finds that incidence rates of ILC—which starts in the milk-producing glands of the breast—have increased more steeply (2.8 percent per year) than all other breast cancers combined (0.8 percent) from 2012 to 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;“Although lobular breast cancer accounts for a little over 10 percent of all breast cancers, the sheer number of new diagnoses each year makes this disease important to understand,” said report author Angela Giaquinto, associate scientist at ACS, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;“Also, survival rates beyond seven years are significantly lower for ILC than the most common type of breast cancer [invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)], highlighting the pressing need for prevention and early detection strategies targeting this subtype to be brought to the forefront.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;The authors emphasize this is needed to improve the chance of better patient outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;In research and clinical trials, ILC is typically combined with the more common IDC, which can conceal many of its own key unique appearance and growth characteristics, according to the study authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;“ILC has distinctive characteristics that can contribute to delayed detection, resistance to therapy, and poorer prognosis for advanced disease,” the study authors wrote in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;“Differentiating ILC from ductal carcinoma in research and clinical trials could help identify risk factors, facilitate treatment efficacy and lead to better understanding of metastatic mechanisms, thus improving outcomes for the increasing number of affected women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;Reflecting a trend seen in other breast cancers, the U.S. report also found the steepest rise in ILC incidence among women of Asian American and Pacific Islander descent, increasing 4.4 percent per year from 2012 to 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;Overall, White women have the highest incidence rate of ILC and Black women have the second highest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;While survival for women with ILC is slightly higher than it is for ductal breast cancer in the first seven years after diagnosis and for localized-stage disease, it is lower for both regional and distant-stage disease at 10 years after diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;“Invasive lobular breast cancer is very understudied, probably because of a very good short-term prognosis. But at 10 years, these women with metastatic disease are half as likely to be alive as their counterparts with ductal cancer, probably because of the unique spread and resistance to therapy,” said author Rebecca Siegel, senior scientific director at ACS, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;“Our study underscores the need for much more information on lobular cancers across the board, from genetic studies to clinical trial data, so we can improve outcomes for the increasing number of women affected with this cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to the researchers for additional comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a tip on a health story that &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; should be covering?

Certain types of collagen, particularly in the developing brain, form a structural scaffold.

Reelin is a crucial protein for proper brain development, helping to maintain cognitive function&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically, Reelin helps protect against the hallmarks of Alzheimer's by reducing the formation of the tau tangles and limiting amyloid plaque formation, both of which are believed to be &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14757525/First-subtle-sign-dementia-strike-20-years-disease-sets-experts-discover-condition-stealth-phase.html"&gt;hallmarks of the disease&lt;/a&gt;. However, ADAMTS2 can impair Reelin's protective function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overactive ADAMTS2 disrupts this protective pathway, leading to increased Tau and amyloid buildup, which drives cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Boston University scientists have identified the ADAMTS2 gene as a major factor in Alzheimer's disease, based on a large study of brains from African American donors (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These findings could open doors to new, targeted genetic treatments designed to inhibit or block the ADAMTS2 protein. Because the effect is the same across people of different ancestries, a drug targeting ADAMTS2 could potentially help a broad range of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lowering ADAMTS2 activity could also be a strategy to prevent symptoms from developing, even in people who have early signs of the disease in their brains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study is also impactful in its design. Historically, most genetic research has been done on people of White/European ancestry. By focusing on an understudied group, Black Americans, the latest research ensures that future Alzheimer's treatments and diagnostic tools will work for them too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is a looming plague in America as the US population skews older by the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The population aged 65 and above grew from approximately 13 percent in 2010 to more than 17 percent in 2022, with forecasts suggesting it could reach nearly 21 percent of the total population by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Age is the most critical risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. Risk of developing the disease doubles approximately every five years after the age of 65, fueling projections that the case burden will rise from the current 7 million cases to nearly 14 million by 2060.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study’s sample included donated brain tissue from 212 African Americans, including 82 cognitively healthy people and 125 with confirmed Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers compared that cohort with another study that included people of European descent to gain a better understanding of the gene’s actions in different demographics. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although this study only included Black participants, its most significant result aligns with the result from the separate study on White participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Lindsay Farrer, chief of biomedical genetics at the school and corresponding author, said: ‘To our knowledge, this is the first time in similarly designed AD genetics studies that the most significant finding was the same in both white and African Americans.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tissue was sourced from the prefrontal cortex, a region particularly affected by Alzheimer’s&lt;span&gt;, and scientists were able to visualize each gene and its level of activity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also identified genes with expression levels that were significantly different between the Alzheimer’s cases and the controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The primary result was the identification of ADAMTS2, which showed the strongest overexpression in Alzheimer’s cases, with its expression levels 1.52 times higher than in controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The same gene was also a top-ranked hit in a separate study’s computer analysis conducted on a predominantly White/European ancestry cohort, confirming its importance across ancestries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers identified 65 genes that behaved consistently across both African American and European Ancestry study groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This shared set included genes that were either significantly overexpressed or underexpressed in Alzheimer's patients compared to healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The critical finding was that the direction of change was identical in both populations; genes turned up in one group were also turned up in the other, and genes turned down were turned down in both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The consistency across study populations indicated that these 65 genes are part of a core mechanism of Alzheimer's disease, common across ancestral backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their findings were published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70629"&gt;Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/a&gt;, the journal of the Alzheimer's Association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers concluded: ‘The inclusion of [African American] participants in AD research is important not only to ensure that predictions made based on genetic and [genomic] data are accurate in this population, but also because of the potential it will lead to new and important advances in knowledge about AD risk that will benefit everyone.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Williams is a mathematician elucidating unexpected connections between algebraic combinatorics and concepts in other areas of math and physics. Williams has made significant contributions to numerous mathematical fields, including cluster algebras, representation theory, and algebraic geometry. She has also forged cross-disciplinary collaborations to tackle long-standing and challenging problems in physics related to quantum field theory, particle physics, and wave propagation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadly, algebraic combinatorics develops mathematical descriptions of the properties and relationships among a finite set of elements that can be combinatorially connected within a system. Much of Williams’s research centers on using combinatorial approaches to understand the nature of the positive Grassmannian. A Grassmannian is a geometric space that encompasses all of the multidimensional planes of a fixed dimension. The positive Grassmannian is the portion with only positive coordinates. In early work, Williams explored how points (formed by the multidimensional planes) in the positive Grassmannian divide it into cells—basically, the puzzle pieces that make it up. She determined several characteristics of the cells, including a formula for the number of different cells in a positive Grassmannian of any dimension. Williams has also uncovered new applications for the Grassmannian. She and a collaborator found correspondences between patterns of soliton wave interactions and points on the positive Grassmannian. Soliton waves are solitary waves that maintain their shape and speed as they move through space, like waves on a pond. Williams and her collaborator showed that the positive Grassmannian can describe how the peaks of soliton waves behave as they cross each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, Williams has worked with mathematicians and particle physicists on applying the combinatorial properties of positive Grassmannians to calculate scattering amplitudes (the probabilities of different outcomes from collisions of fundamental particles). Williams has developed mathematical proofs for the amplituhedron, a geometric shape that embodies a possible outcome of a collision. She showed that the positive Grassmannian can be used to triangulate the amplituhedron and, therefore, understand its volume, which gives the amplitude. With a curiosity-driven approach to research and willingness to collaborate across disciplines, Williams is expanding fundamental mathematical theory and building fruitful connections between mathematics and other scientific fields.&lt;/p&gt;            &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MacArthur Foundation</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 17:51:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTFBvLV91V1ZYQVlxRnB2U29aZUVockJkYncyb0hpVG40c2xCeUxIUEFyQ05sNWpsVl90a0VzSzVrTUJ0VXBOQUhlUXBsLWJEUmJ4QVEwUHBYdVJnSTc5dG11X24xV1RXWi1kdmNEUGxqczAtUQ</guid></item><item><title>大脑健康：改善大脑功能的10个简单步骤-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/brain-health-10-simple-steps-you-should-take-to-improve-brain-function/photostory/124394470.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human brain is an astonishing machine- complex, adaptive, and constantly reshaping itself in response to how we live.

We analysed 16 genes in the bladders of 45 people, yet we already found important differences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The same approach can be applied to other tissues and risk factors.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But researchers also saw a striking effect among samples of donors who had previously smoked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among donors over the age of 55, those with a history of smoking carried a high frequency of mutations in the TERT promoter, a DNA element that allows cells to avoid aging and continue dividing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bladder cancer is &lt;span&gt;the 11th most common cancer in the UK, and the 7th most common cancer in men.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prominent figures who have had bladder cancer include singer Frank Sinatra, actor James Lipton, and British artist Tracey Emin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roughly with 80 per cent of cases diagnosed every year are in over 65s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As well as blood in urine, bladder cancer symptoms include more frequent and painful urination, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, incontinence and abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Rumsey said that pumpkin seeds provide protein, magnesium, and vitamin E, which have been linked to anti-inflammatory benefits.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re considering adding pumpkin or chia seeds to your diet, consider what areas of your health you hope to boost.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Chia seeds excel in promoting glycemic control and cardiovascular, bone, and digestive health due to their high fiber and omega-3 content,” Johnson said. “Pumpkin seeds are especially valuable for protein, mineral support, prostate health, sleep quality, and immune function.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no reason you can’t add both to your diet. Just remember that eating chia seeds dry can be a choking hazard and cause gastrointestinal discomfort.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Therefore, if you aren’t mixing them into a dish with wet ingredients—such as yogurt or salad dressing—you should soak them before eating.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damage to the brainstem - the brain's 'control center' - is behind long-lasting physical and psychiatric effects of severe Covid-19 infection, a study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using ultra-high-resolution scanners that can see the living brain in fine detail, researchers from the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford were able to observe the damaging effects Covid-19 can have on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study team scanned the brains of 30 people who had been admitted to hospital with severe Covid-19 early in the pandemic, before vaccines were available. The researchers found that Covid-19 infection damages the region of the brainstem associated with breathlessness, fatigue and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The powerful MRI scanners used for the study, known as 7-Tesla or 7T scanners, can measure &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/What-Does-Inflammation-Do-to-the-Body.aspx" class="linked-term"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; in the brain. Their results, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Brain&lt;/em&gt;, will help scientists and clinicians understand the long-term effects of Covid-19 on the brain and the rest of the body. Although the study was started before the long-term effects of Covid were recognised, it will help to better understand this condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brainstem, which connects the brain to the spinal cord, is the control center for many basic life functions and reflexes. Clusters of nerve cells in the brainstem, known as nuclei, regulate and process essential bodily functions such as breathing, heart rate, pain and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things happening in and around the brainstem are vital for quality of life, but it had been impossible to scan the inflammation of the brainstem nuclei in living people, because of their tiny size and difficult position. Usually, scientists only get a good look at the brainstem during post-mortem examinations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Catarina Rua, first author from the Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The brainstem is the critical junction box between our conscious selves and what is happening in our bodies," said Professor James Rowe, also from the Department of Clinical Neurosciences, who co-led the research. "The ability to see and understand how the brainstem changes in response to Covid-19 will help explain and treat the long-term effects more effectively."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, before effective vaccines were available, post-mortem studies of patients who had died from severe Covid-19 infections showed changes in their brainstems, including inflammation. Many of these changes were thought to result from a post-infection immune response, rather than direct virus invasion of the brain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mobile-middle-mrec-promo-spot" class="mobile-promo-wrap mobile-promo-mrec"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"People who were very sick early in the pandemic showed long-lasting brain changes, likely caused by an immune response to the virus. But measuring that immune response is difficult in living people," said Rowe. "Normal hospital-type MRI scanners can't see inside the brain with the kind of chemical and physical detail we need."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="trendmd-conditional-suggestions" class="related-content-embed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But with 7T scanners, we can now measure these details. The active immune cells interfere with the ultra-high magnetic field, so that we're able to detect how they are behaving," said Rua. "Cambridge was special because we were able to scan even the sickest and infectious patients, early in the pandemic."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the patients admitted to hospital early in the pandemic reported fatigue, breathlessness and chest pain as troubling long-lasting symptoms. The researchers hypothesised these symptoms were in part the result of damage to key brainstem nuclei, damage which persists long after Covid-19 infection has passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers saw that multiple regions of the brainstem, in particular the medulla oblongata, pons and midbrain, showed abnormalities consistent with a neuroinflammatory response. The abnormalities appeared several weeks after hospital admission, and in regions of the brain responsible for controlling breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The fact that we see abnormalities in the parts of the brain associated with breathing strongly suggests that long-lasting symptoms are an effect of inflammation in the brainstem following Covid-19 infection," said Rua. "These effects are over and above the effects of age and gender, and are more pronounced in those who had had severe Covid-19."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the physical effects of Covid-19, the 7T scanners provided evidence of some of the psychiatric effects of the disease. The brainstem monitors breathlessness, as well as fatigue and anxiety. "Mental health is intimately connected to brain health, and patients with the most marked immune response also showed higher levels of depression and anxiety," said Rowe. "Changes in the brainstem caused by Covid-19 infection could also lead to poor mental health outcomes, because of the tight connection between physical and mental health."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers say the results could aid in the understanding of other conditions associated with inflammation of the brainstem, like MS and dementia. The 7T scanners could also be used to monitor the effectiveness of different treatments for brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This was an incredible collaboration, right at the peak of the pandemic, when testing was very difficult, and I was amazed how well the 7T scanners worked," said Rua. "I was really impressed with how, in the heat of the moment, the collaboration between lots of different researchers came together so effectively."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was supported in part by the NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre, the NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, and the University of Oxford COVID Medical Sciences Division Rapid Response Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mobile-bottom-promo-spot" class="mobile-promo-wrap mobile-promo-leaderboard-320"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is a potent psychoactive molecule present in the brain and much of the world’s plant life, but it also may be able to save humans from damage in the event of a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists in Hungary used it to reduce the harmful effects of stroke in animal models and cell culture experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known to produce life-changing experiences reported to include the perception of dimensional travel, eco-death, encounters with intelligent beings, and the feeling of achieving a universal love with all living things, DMT can be found everywhere in nature, and is in fact produced endogenously in the human pineal gland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hungarian team, led by Professor Mária Deli, Professor Zoltán Nagy, and Dr. Sándor Nardai, found that DMT treatment restored the structure and function of the damaged blood-brain barrier in mice that had suffered a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also improved the function of astrocytes, inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines in brain endothelial cells and peripheral immune cells, and significantly reduced infarct volume and edema formation. The team &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adx5958"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; these results in the journal Science Advances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The therapeutic options currently available for stroke are very limited. The dual action of DMT, protecting the blood-brain barrier while reducing brain inflammation, offers a novel, complex approach that could complement existing treatments,” &lt;a href="https://www.brc.hu/en/blog/2025/9/19/a-natural-compound-against-stroke-psychoactive-agent-protects-brain-vessels-and-reduces-inflammation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Judit Vigh, co-first author of the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PSYCHEDELIC RESEARCH: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since current stroke therapies do not always result in full recovery, a DMT-based treatment may represent a promising new alternative, mainly in combination with existing methods. The recent findings from researchers in Szeged and Budapest support the development of a therapy that goes beyond the limitations of conventional stroke treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials have already begun abroad, and investigation on the long-term effects of DMT are currently ongoing, but there is still a long way to go before it reaches everyday medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most European countries including Hungary consider DMT a hallucinogen and therefore controlled via strict criminal laws, both the Netherlands and Portugal have taken a more open position on DMT and arguably the more well-known ayahuasca, in which DMT is an active ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 800,000 strokes occur annually in the US. 1 in 6 deaths (17.5%) from cardiovascular disease in the most recent data-collected year, were due to stroke. Costs from strokes rose to $56 billion during that year.&lt;/p&gt;

Using ultra-accurate DNA sequencing, scientists found that sperm from older men were significantly more likely to carry disease-causing mutations, including those linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon, known as “selfish selection,” allows certain mutations to thrive within the testes, increasing risks to offspring over time. The findings offer crucial insights into how paternal age influences genetic inheritance and the mechanisms driving mutation spread across generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age-Linked Mutation Rise:&lt;/strong&gt; Harmful mutations increase from ~2% in younger men’s sperm to 3–5% in older men.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selfish Selection:&lt;/strong&gt; Some mutations gain a biological advantage during sperm production, helping them spread.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic Health Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Many affected genes are tied to disorders in children and inherited cancer risks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Wellcome Sanger Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harmful genetic changes in sperm become substantially more common as men age because some are actively favoured during sperm production, new research has revealed. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a landmark study published today (8 October) in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, researchers from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, in collaboration with the TwinsUK study at King’s College London, have comprehensively mapped how harmful DNA changes in sperm cells can increase across the genome as men age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113274"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene.jpg" alt="This shows a sperm cell and DNA." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt; The work highlights how natural selection within sperm can be directly observed in the DNA of children, influencing their chances of inheriting certain genetic disorders. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings create new possibilities to explore how lifestyle and environmental factors might influence genetic risks passed on to future generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In renewing tissues, mutations – changes in DNA – can give cells a competitive advantage leading to ‘clones’ of cells that carry the same mutations. Groups of these clones then expand to outgrow other cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike mutations in ordinary, or somatic cells, which make up connective tissue, bones and organs, mutations in sperm and egg cells are transmitted to the next generation of offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, until recently, it has been difficult to measure how strongly these mutations are favoured in sperm because DNA sequencing methods were not accurate enough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, researchers used NanoSeq, an ultra-accurate DNA sequencing method to analyse sperm from 81 healthy men, aged between 24 and 75 years, with unprecedented precision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sperm samples were collected as part of the TwinsUK cohort, the UK’s largest adult twin registry, providing a unique opportunity to study genetic variation across a diverse and well-characterised population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results show that around 2 per cent of sperm from men in their early 30s carried disease-causing mutations, but this rises to 3–5 per cent of sperm from middle-aged (43 to 58 years) and older men (59 to 74 years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst men may be more likely to father children at a younger age, the researchers found that in those aged 70, 4.5 per cent of sperm carry disease-causing mutations. This clear age-related rise highlights how genetic risks for offspring increase as fathers get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This risk is driven not just by the steady build-up of random changes in DNA, but by a subtle form of natural selection acting on the sperm-producing cells in the testes, giving some mutations a competitive edge during sperm production. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers identified 40 genes where certain changes in DNA are favoured during sperm production, including many linked to severe neurodevelopmental disorders in children and inherited cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While 13 genes have already been associated with this process, the new findings show it is far more widespread than previously understood, affecting a broad range of genes important for cell growth and development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the proportion of sperm carrying harmful mutations increases with age, not all of these changes lead to successful fertilisation or live births. Some may impair fertilisation, embryo development, or result in pregnancy loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research is needed to understand exactly how the growing burden of sperm mutations translates into health outcomes for children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope that uncovering how variations in DNA arise and are shaped by selection in sperm will help improve reproductive risk assessment and open new opportunities to study how environmental and lifestyle factors impact genetic risks in future generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a complementary study, also published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; today, scientists from Harvard Medical School and the Sanger Institute investigated the same phenomenon from a different angle by looking at mutations already passed on to children, rather than those measured directly in sperm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By analysing DNA from over 54,000 parent–child trios and 800,000 healthy individuals, the team identified more than 30 genes where mutations give sperm cells a competitive edge, again including many linked to rare developmental disorders and cancer, and many overlapping the set of genes observed directly in sperm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that these mutations can increase sperm mutation rates roughly 500-fold which helps explain why some rare genetic disorders appear when parents do not carry the mutations in their own DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study notes that as these mutations are common in the sperm, it may look like some genes cause false-positive disease association due to the elevated mutation rate rather than a true disease link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work highlights how natural selection within sperm can be directly observed in the DNA of children, influencing their chances of inheriting certain genetic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Matthew Neville, first author from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: “We expected to find some evidence of selection shaping mutations in sperm. What surprised us was just how much it drives up the number of sperm carrying mutations linked to serious diseases.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Matt Hurles, Director of the Wellcome Sanger Institute and co-author, said: “Our findings reveal a hidden genetic risk that increases with paternal age. Some changes in DNA not only survive but thrive within the testes, meaning that fathers who conceive later in life may unknowingly have a higher risk of passing on a harmful mutation to their children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Kerrin Small, co-author and Scientific Director of the TwinsUK study at King’s College London, said: “We are incredibly grateful to the twins who took part in this study. By working with the TwinsUK cohort, we could include valuable longitudinal samples linked to rich health and genetic information, allowing us to explore how mutations accumulate and evolve with age in healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This collaboration highlights the power of large, population-based cohorts for advancing our understanding of human development and inheritance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Raheleh Rahbari, senior author and Group Leader at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: “There’s a common assumption that because the germline has a low mutation rate, it is well protected. But in reality, the male germline is a dynamic environment where natural selection can favour harmful mutations, sometimes with consequences for the next generation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is part-funded by Wellcome.

In humans, positive selection of driver mutations during spermatogenesis can increase the birth prevalence of certain developmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, characterizing the extent of this selection in sperm has been limited by the error rates of sequencing technologies. Here we used the duplex sequencing method NanoSeq to sequence 81 bulk sperm samples from individuals aged 24–75 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings revealed a linear accumulation of 1.67 (95% confidence interval of 1.41–1.92) mutations per year per haploid genome driven by two mutational signatures associated with human ageing. Deep targeted and exome NanoSeq of sperm samples identified more than 35,000 germline coding mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We detected 40 genes (31 newly identified) under significant positive selection in the male germline that have activating or loss-of-function mechanisms and are involved in diverse cellular pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the positively selected genes are associated with developmental or cancer predisposition disorders in children, whereas four of the genes exhibited increased frequencies of protein-truncating variants in healthy populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show that positive selection during spermatogenesis drives a 2–3-fold increased risk of known disease-causing mutations, which results in 3–5% of sperm from middle-aged to older individuals with a pathogenic mutation across the exome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings shed light on germline selection dynamics and highlight a broader increased disease risk for children born to fathers of advanced age than previously appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 16:57:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxQbEpxdzJXbFFyNE40RG1uSEl4enpTM3h2ME1GTlVqNE92VnNZeUhuQkNFRVNtMXR4a2t3dlJXUVkzbENGdGptRHN0RlFIMVZDS2xwQzF6RmxENm5ySUJ5QjhDelNodURhQkpYZU5qcUNNZ0hlUDdMVFRoWlBmNFU1SkdB</guid></item><item><title>“谷歌DNA”为生物学大数据带来秩序-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03219-w</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03219-w/d41586-025-03219-w_51546810.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03219-w/d41586-025-03219-w_51546810.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Close up view of a researcher's hand interacting with a DNA sequence on a digital display." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03219-w/d41586-025-03219-w_51546810.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;MetaGraph indexes and vast archives of DNA, RNA, and protein sequences.

In the same way that YouTube searches can retrieve every video that features, say, red balloons even when those key words don’t appear in the title, tags or description, MetaGraph can uncover genetic patterns hidden deep within expansive sequencing data sets without needing those patterns to be explicitly annotated in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It enables things that cannot be done in any other way,” Chikhi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02826-1" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03219-w/d41586-025-03219-w_24038964.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Smart software untangles gene regulation in cells&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Indexing life’s library&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The motivation behind MetaGraph was to address an accessibility problem in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d42859-020-00002-x/index.html" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d42859-020-00002-x/index.html" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;sequencing data sets&lt;/a&gt;. The size of these repositories has risen at a blistering pace in the past few decades, but this growth has presented challenges for the scientists using the data they contain. Raw sequencing reads are fragmented, noisy and too numerous to search directly. “The volume of the data, paradoxically, is the main inhibitor of us actually using the data,” says Babaian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study author, André Kahles, a bioinformatician at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich in Switzerland, MetaGraph could help researchers to ask biological questions of repositories such as the Sequence Read Archive (&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;SRA&lt;/a&gt;), a public database containing in excess of 100 million billion DNA letters&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They tackled the problem through the use of mathematical ‘graphs’ that links overlapping DNA fragments together, much like sentences that share the same words lining up in a book index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers integrated data from seven publicly funded data repositories, creating 18.8 million unique DNA and RNA sequence sets and 210 billion amino-acid sequence sets across all clades of life — including viruses, bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, including humans. They also developed a search engine for these sequences, in which users use text prompts to search these integrated archives of raw data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is a totally new way to interact with this body of data,” says Kahles. “It’s compressed, but accessible on the fly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03423-0" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;The huge protein database that spawned AlphaFold and biology’s AI revolution&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate the utility of MetaGraph, the study authors used it to scan 241,384 human gut microbiome samples for genetic indicators of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03218-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03218-x" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;antibiotic resistance around the world&lt;/a&gt;, building on work that used an earlier version of the tool to track drug-resistance genes in bacterial strains that live in subway systems across major urban centres&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.
