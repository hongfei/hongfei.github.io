Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is the first to shed light on the molecular differences between directly acquired PTSD and bystander PTSD and could pave the way for changes in how the disorders are treated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Currently, patients with directly acquired PTSD and bystander PTSD are treated the same way – with a combination of therapy and medication,”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;said&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Timothy Jarome,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the project’s principal investigator and associate professor of neurobiology in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research suggests that indirect trauma and direct trauma create different biological responses, which could mean they require different treatment strategies that target distinct brain pathways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Understanding how observation leads to PTSD&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jarome’s research focuses on understanding the neurobiological mechanisms behind memory-related disorders, including PTSD, dementia, and Alzheimer’s disease. His interest in bystander PTSD arose after learning about PTSD symptoms reported in people who witnessed the deadly 2021 collapse of a Miami condominium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who saw it from across the street reported that they were suffering from nightmares, insomnia, and anxiety,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They were showing symptoms of PTSD, but didn’t go through it or have any connection to the people in the building. We sought out to understand the brain mechanisms behind how that occurred.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers focused on protein changes caused by a fear stimulus in three key brain regions involved in fear memory: the amygdala, the anterior cingulate cortex, and the retrosplenial cortex. They discovered that witnessing trauma triggered distinct protein degradation patterns in all three regions, compared to directly experiencing trauma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, they uncovered sex-specific differences in how male and female brains process indirect fear memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings build on previous research from Jarome’s lab, which identified a specific protein, known as K-63 ubiquitin, linked to PTSD development in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings highlight significant biological differences in how male and female brains respond to witnessing trauma,” said the paper’s lead author, Shaghayegh Navabpour, a former Ph.D. student in translational biology, medicine, and health who is now a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These differences may help explain why women are twice as likely as men to develop PTSD, leading to more targeted treatments that consider these sex-specific factors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In future research, Jarome hopes to explore how these how these molecular pathways could be leveraged to develop more precise PTSD therapies. He also hopes to examine the role of empathy, which originates in a different brain region called the anterior insular cortex, in bystander PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The vital role of student researchers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by a $420,000 grant from the National Institute of Mental Health, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. In addition to supporting equipment and materials costs of the research, the grant helped pay the stipends of graduate and undergraduate research assistants on the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At academic institutions, students — undergraduate, graduate, and postdocs — are the driving force for research,” Jarome said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While faculty members might secure the funding to do the projects, the reality is that the work is done by these students as they’re going through their training. Without graduate students, especially, but also undergraduates and postdocs, science doesn’t advance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navabpour, who earned her Ph.D. from Virginia Tech in 2023, is now working at Stanford to develop a drug to help treat Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My time in Dr. Jarome’s lab was hugely valuable in shaping my career and preparing me for my current role as a postdoc and my goal of becoming a faculty member,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I learned how to think scientifically — how to ask the right questions and approach problems critically — and gained hands-on experience with key methods and techniques that continue to inform my research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and PTSD research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d4b9bfb5a7bcb6a1a6ba94a2a0fab1b0a1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Margaret Ashburn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://vt.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Margaret Ashburn – Virginia Tech&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research:&lt;/strong&gt; Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0315564" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Indirectly acquired fear memories have distinct, sex-specific molecular signatures from directly acquired fear memories&lt;/a&gt;” by Timothy Jarome et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indirectly acquired fear memories have distinct, sex-specific molecular signatures from directly acquired fear memories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe anxiety disorder that affects women more than men. About 30% of patients suffering from PTSD develop the disorder by witnessing a traumatic event happen to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, as the focus has remained on those directly experiencing the traumatic event, whether indirectly acquired fear memories that underlie PTSD have the same molecular signature as those that are directly acquired remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, using a rodent indirect fear learning paradigm where one rat (observer) watches another rat (demonstrator) associate an auditory cue with foot shock, we found that fear can be indirectly acquired by both males and females regardless of the sex or novelty (familiarity) of the demonstrator animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, behaviorally, indirectly acquired fear responses resemble those of pseudoconditioning, a behavioral response that is thought to not represent learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this, using unbiased proteomics, we found that indirectly acquired fear memories have distinct protein degradation profiles in the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) relative to directly acquired fear memories and pseudoconditioning, which further differed significantly by sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;em&gt;Egr2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;c-fos&lt;/em&gt; expression in the retrosplenial cortex of observer animals resembled that of demonstrator rats but was significantly different than that of pseudoconditioned rats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings reveal that indirectly acquired fear memories have sex-specific molecular signatures that differ from those of directly acquired fear memories or pseudoconditioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These data have important implications for understanding the neurobiology of indirectly acquired fear memories that may underlie bystander PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 19:56:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5hZ2ZxdnRLNklvS1lOM3V5TFJaNngyYURhUGl0aVBYSGZ2Y1VGUlFwWkl3Q01kNndSN0g0R3ZLZ2pUZTRmRW1ydWpSc1VrVWhVdzRSaWNkSzE0anROQmhmcUQ5TVl6SHdER3J6NHNRTy0</guid></item><item><title>Verbal Fluency Might Predict Human Longevity - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibEFVX3lxTE9BdXNlWVJXTjdsb0hzdmJCRmRvT1RoT2ZjYVd0V3g2UUVTLTFVc056bExnaFg4cndyMlQ5ZTVrd0pGTGdDZDRNMEMyWHlEd1J1UG1SNUd6bURtMDZaTkw3MzJidWJXQTRhTnBGbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A recent study reveals a surprising link between longevity and verbal fluency—the ability to effectively recall and utilize vocabulary. Researchers analyzed cognitive data from the Berlin Aging Study, involving over 500 elderly participants tracked for nearly two decades, assessing verbal fluency alongside memory, perceptual speed, and verbal knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of these cognitive traits, verbal fluency emerged as the strongest predictor of longevity, indicating that individuals with sharper linguistic abilities tend to live longer. This finding suggests verbal fluency might serve as a marker of broader cognitive and physical well-being, highlighting the intricate connection between mental acuity and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verbal Fluency &amp;amp; Longevity:&lt;/strong&gt; Among various cognitive traits tested, verbal fluency alone showed a significant link to increased lifespan.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extensive Dataset:&lt;/strong&gt; The study analyzed data collected over 18 years from 516 elderly participants in the Berlin Aging Study.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complex Cognitive Marker:&lt;/strong&gt; Verbal fluency likely serves as an indicator of broader health and cognitive function, including memory and mental agility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;APS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone ages, but, sometimes, people outlive all predictions. Previous research has uncovered an unlikely factor related to longevity: intelligence (Bäckman &amp;amp; MacDonald, 2006; Bosworth &amp;amp; Siegler, 2002).  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, intelligence isn’t a simple characteristic. There are many traits that contribute to it that can be tested—from memory to mathematical logic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108165"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older man and words." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/verbal-fluency-longevity-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Following that theory, verbal fluency would be a good measure of well-being, Ghisletta explained, because it’s a complex process that relies on multiple cognitive abilities. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 2024 &lt;em&gt;Clinical Psychological Science &lt;/em&gt;study, Paolo Ghisletta of the University of Geneva linked longevity specifically to one of those traits: verbal fluency, the measure of one’s vocabulary and ability to use it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghisletta’s research used samples from the Berlin Aging Study, which started collecting data shortly before the Berlin Wall came down in 1989 (Baltes &amp;amp; Mayer, 1999). It tracked 516 people aged 70 to 105 from enrollment to their death, over as long as 18 years in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study measured factors like dental health, stress levels, and economic well-being, as well as cognition. This makes it a “rich and rare data set,” said Ghisletta in an interview.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the current study, researchers sampled nine different cognitive tests to understand if different aspects of intelligence might be more closely linked to longevity than others.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tests measured four cognitive abilities: verbal fluency, perceptual speed, verbal knowledge, and episodic memory. Perceptual speed is a measure of one’s ability to compare, scan, or perform pattern-assessing tasks with visual cues quickly. Verbal knowledge is a measure of one’s vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Episodic memory is a measure of one’s ability to recall and remember personal experiences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these categories was measured with several tests. One of the tests, for instance, measured verbal fluency by requiring participants to name as many animals as they could within 90 seconds.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compiling data on the different cognitive skills, Ghisletta and his team incorporated information about how the participants’ performance changed and estimated their risk of dying over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They then developed a model that related the observed changes to risk of death. This required input from researchers across multiple universities with expertise in a type of data analysis called joint multivariate longitudinal survival model.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Today, it’s gotten much easier to do this kind of research because there are more data available. There are more people who are willing to collaborate. There are better tools,” Ghisletta said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applying these novel tools, the researchers discovered that verbal fluency alone seemed to be significantly linked to longevity, though the explanation behind this connection is not clear.  One popular theory, Ghisletta explained, is that the physical body is inextricably linked to mental, emotional, and cognitive processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All of these domains are just declining together, whether it’s cognition, personality, emotions, or biological, medical decline in general,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following that theory, verbal fluency would be a good measure of well-being, Ghisletta explained, because it’s a complex process that relies on multiple cognitive abilities. This might include long-term memory, vocabulary, efficiency, and visual memory. So, when you’re testing your verbal fluency, “you are doing something very interesting,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research answers questions that Ghisletta has had since his time as a postdoctoral researcher in the 1990s. But it only became possible to perform analyses of this sort recently. He said this paper underscores the importance of collaboration between labs and makes him hopeful for more fruitful papers to come.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a good time to be doing research. I’m really happy to work with young PhD students and have them play around with these different data sets and variables and the theoretical questions that we want to answer,” Ghisletta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Although we are building up knowledge, every day, there’s still so much here to discover.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this language and longevity research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#84ece6f6ebf3eac4f4f7fde7ecebe8ebe3ede7e5e8f7e7ede1eae7e1aaebf6e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hannah Brown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://psychologicalscience.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;APS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Hannah Brown – APS&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orignial Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/09567976241311923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Verbal Fluency Selectively Predicts Survival in Old and Very Old Age&lt;/a&gt;” by Paolo Ghisletta et al. &lt;em&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verbal Fluency Selectively Predicts Survival in Old and Very Old Age&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intelligence is known to predict survival, but it remains unclear whether cognitive abilities differ in their relationship to survival in old age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed longitudinal data of 516 healthy adults (age: &lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt; = 84.92 years, &lt;em&gt;SD&lt;/em&gt; = 8.66 years at Wave 1) from the Berlin Aging Study (Germany) on nine tasks of perceptual speed, episodic memory, verbal fluency, and verbal knowledge, and a general composite intelligence score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were eight waves, with up to 18 years of follow-up; all participants were deceased by the time of analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used a joint multivariate longitudinal survival model to estimate the unique contribution of each cognitive ability in terms of true (i.e., error-free) current value and current rate of change when predicting survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional survival covariates included age at first occasion, sex, sociobiographical status, and suspected dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only the two verbal-fluency measures were uniquely predictive of mortality risk.

&lt;p&gt;Planning a sunny getaway? You might want to pack a mosquito net. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health experts &lt;a href="https://www.cmaj.ca/content/197/9/E244#msdynmkt_trackingcontext=fed021b2-0f52-49ac-9c7a-72decef20000" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;are warning&lt;/a&gt; about an emerging threat making waves in popular vacation destinations, as cases of the Oropouche virus have been reported in US and Canadian travelers returning from Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Cuba and Peru.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While much about the tropical disease remains unknown, the recent spate of infections has raised questions about whether it could become the next Zika virus. Here’s everything you need to know about this potential travel headache.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Mosquitoes are believed to play a role in Oropouche virus transmission.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;wirakorn – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is the Oropouche virus?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Oropouche virus is primarily spread through the bites of small flies called midges, as well as certain species of mosquitoes. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s commonly referred to as “&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/health/what-is-sloth-fever-oropouche-virus/"&gt;sloth fever&lt;/a&gt;” because the virus was first identified in the slow-moving mammal, which researchers believe played a key role in its spread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since its discovery in 1955, there have been an &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5938787/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;estimated 500,000 cases of Oropouche virus&lt;/a&gt;, mostly around the Amazon Basin. However, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/data-maps/countries-and-territories-at-risk-for-oropouche.html"&gt;starting in late 2023&lt;/a&gt;, the virus has started popping up in new areas of South America and the Caribbean where it hadn’t been seen before, raising concerns about its expanding reach.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;As of March 11, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/data-maps/current-year-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;CDC has identified&lt;/a&gt; 109 cases of sloth fever in US travelers from seven states, including &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/press/releases/2024/2024-09-12_rare_virus.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one case in New York&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of the illnesses have been reported in Florida, with 103 cases so far in 2024 and the first three months of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Symptoms to watch for&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re bitten by a mosquito or midge carrying the Oropouche virus, symptoms can appear anywhere from three to 10 days later, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/symptoms/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most common symptoms include a sudden fever and severe headache, often resembling those of other tropical illnesses like &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/07/25/dengue-fever-cases-could-reach-near-record-highs-this-year-what-to-know-about-the-tropical-infectious-disease/#!"&gt;dengue&lt;/a&gt;, chikungunya, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2016/01/28/first-person-account-of-being-stricken-with-the-zika-virus/"&gt;Zika&lt;/a&gt; or malaria. Additional symptoms can include chills, muscle aches, joint pain, light sensitivity, dizziness, pain behind the eyes, nausea, vomiting and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Many of the symptoms of sloth fever are similar to those of other tropical diseases, such as the Zika virus. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Dragana Gordic – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In most cases, symptoms last less than a week, with most people fully recovering within a month. However, the CDC notes that some individuals may experience a recurrence of symptoms, either a few days or even weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In rare cases, the Oropouche virus can cause more severe conditions, such as excessive bleeding, brain swelling, or &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/10/28/health/guillain-barre-patient-running-nyc-marathon-a-decade-after-diagnosis/"&gt;Guillain-Barré syndrome&lt;/a&gt;, which can lead to muscle weakness, numbness and paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While fatalities are uncommon, there have been a &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/news/24-7-2024-qa-oropouche-fever" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;few instances where the virus has proven fatal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Pregnancy risk&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Oropouche virus doesn’t just pose a threat to adults and children — it can also be transmitted from a pregnant person to their unborn fetus, with potentially devastating consequences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Multiple reports of fetal loss among women with Oropouche virus disease during early and late pregnancy have been reported. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Yakobchuk Olena – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Infection during pregnancy has been linked to stillbirths, miscarriages, and other serious risks to the fetus, such as low birth weight, skull collapse, club foot, and microcephaly, a condition where brain development is significantly impaired.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given these risks, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/outbreaks/2024/index.html#:~:text=Oropouche%20virus%20is%20spread%20to,Travel%20Health%20Notice%20for%20Oropouche." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;is advising&lt;/a&gt; pregnant women to reconsider any nonessential travel to areas where &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level1/oropouche-in-the-americas" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Oropouche outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; have recently been reported.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How is sloth fever treated? &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there’s no vaccine to prevent or specific medication to treat Oropouche virus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To manage symptoms, the CDC recommends getting plenty of rest, staying hydrated, and taking over-the-counter pain relievers. But don’t reach for aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, as they can increase the risk of excessive bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those with more severe symptoms, additional medical care or even hospitalization may be required to ensure proper treatment and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How to protect yourself from the Oropouche virus?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To steer clear of the Oropouche virus, your best bet is to minimize exposure to mosquito and midge bites.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/prevention/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; wearing loose, long-sleeved shirts and pants when traveling to regions where the virus is circulating.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Loose fitting, long-sleeve shirts can help prevent mosquito bites.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;aamulya – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Make sure your accommodations are bug-proof by using window and door screens, or set up a fan outdoors to keep the pests at bay. And of course, don’t forget to bring along insect repellent.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/30/12/24-1470_article" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; also found traces of Oropouche virus in the semen of an infected individual for the first time. While no sexual transmission cases have been reported, the CDC suggests that travelers who are worried about contracting or passing the virus through sex to consider using condoms or abstaining from sex during travel and for six weeks after returning home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Could sloth fever start to spread in the US?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Oropouche cases have been reported in American travelers, the risk of widespread transmission in the continental US remains low.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CDC notes that the US has a different climate and distinct species of mosquitoes and midges compared to those in regions where the virus is common. Additionally, factors like air conditioning make it less likely for the virus to take root. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the agency does warn that infections could still pop up in certain areas. &lt;/p&gt;

She pushed for more, like a CT scan. Because &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/raised-in-canada-live-in-us-life-better-in-us-2024-11" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;Canada's healthcare system&lt;/a&gt; is public, wait times were longer. The CT scan she was scheduled for was a year out, in October 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, she tried to mitigate her extreme &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/most-common-symptoms-colon-cancer-under-50s-chart-2024-5" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;abdominal discomfort&lt;/a&gt; by eating smaller snacks. Still, she was frequently constipated, had pencil-thin stools, and felt a nagging pain in her left side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No matter what I ate, I was in excruciating pain, pretty much yelling for help," Desroches, now 27, told Business Insider. "I knew with my symptoms I wasn't going to make it" to the scan, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desroches was eventually admitted for an emergency &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/get-colonoscopy-colon-cancer-symptoms-colorectal-oncologist-2024-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;colonoscopy&lt;/a&gt; in early 2024, but the procedure couldn't be finished — the tumor in her colon was too big. The GI specialist "couldn't get the camera through," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was diagnosed with stage 4 &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-to-know-about-colon-cancer-symptoms-diagnosis-chadwick-boseman" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;, given a three-year life expectancy.

"That's the most frustrating part to me, knowing that I shouldn't have to be here fighting stage 4."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="60dcc152-fb2b-4454-94b2-7211b8bd4df5" data-toc-id="60dcc152-fb2b-4454-94b2-7211b8bd4df5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From dismissal to emergency surgery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                                Desroches was admitted to emergency surgery after the discovery of a blockage in her colon.

                        &lt;/figure&gt;
                      &lt;p&gt;Desroches started with an&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;MRI in April 2024, which she managed to book thanks to the help of a family friend. When she&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;left the room, her family friend and a GI surgeon were waiting for her. "They were like, 'I don't want to freak you out, but we need to admit you, you have a blockage,'" she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;colonoscopy the next morning confirmed it was a tumor, and she&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;was immediately admitted to a six-hour surgery, which removed part of her large intestine where the tumor was located, her right ovary, 13 lymph nodes, and part of the membrane lining her liver. The surgeon couldn't remove the large tumors on the liver itself without causing liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she woke up in the morning with her husband by her side, the surgeon broke the news: she had stage 4 cancer. If they wanted children, the doctor recommended starting &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/39-year-old-woman-spent-6000-on-egg-retrieval-2022-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;egg retrieval&lt;/a&gt; from her left ovary right away, because the cancer was likely to spread quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I remember just almost disassociating," Desroches said. Once the doctors left, she and her husband broke down. "We just had a good cry together and just bawled."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="2e60a74b-2873-4b49-8249-352a2b73f7da" data-toc-id="2e60a74b-2873-4b49-8249-352a2b73f7da"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Searching for care options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                        &lt;/figure&gt;
                      &lt;p&gt;Desroches decided to pursue &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cancer-breakthroughs-immunotherapies-and-personalized-treatments-2022-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;immunotherapy&lt;/a&gt;, a specialized treatment that trains&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;her immune system to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;attack the cancer cells in her body, alongside two chemotherapy drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
                        
                      &lt;p&gt;Chemo became complicated. On round 13 of receiving oxaliplatin, a chemotherapy drug, Desroches went into&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/anaphylaxis" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;anaphylactic shock&lt;/a&gt;, and had to stop taking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was probably the scariest feeling I've ever felt, knowing that my body is literally shutting down on me," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, the results of her treatment make her nervous: her CT scan in January was the first one in which her tumors didn't shrink. She doesn't know what to anticipate for her next one, in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Desroches is searching for other options. The surgery she needs, a hepatic arterial infusion pump to deliver chemotherapy drugs directly into her liver, is only available as a clinical trial in Canada — one she doesn't qualify for because she has cancer outside her liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The procedure is more routine in the US, but her oncologist said the treatment could cost $500,000 or more when considering testing, a US hospital stay, and treating any complications — something that isn't financially feasible for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She's now looking into options in Europe and started a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/shannins-cancer-fight" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=" nofollow"&gt;GoFundMe page&lt;/a&gt; for her cancer treatments. "It's very overwhelming, but when you're in fight-or-flight mode for your life, it doesn't matter," she said. "You just do it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="929fd71e-d669-4184-979b-f757825e52ad" data-toc-id="929fd71e-d669-4184-979b-f757825e52ad"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focusing on the future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                        &lt;/figure&gt;
                      &lt;p&gt;Since starting treatment in 2024, Desroches and her family are trying to stay optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, Desroches married her husband, Cody Desroches, at a beachside wedding in Jamaica. "I would do anything to go&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;back to that day," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They're planning to have kids, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week after her surgery, Desroches met with a fertility doctor to begin her egg-freezing process immediately. "This was the most pain I've ever been in," she said. She was nauseous from the &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/egg-freezing-fertility-clinics-targeting-gen-z-women-high-cost-2024-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;hormone injections&lt;/a&gt;, dry-heaving so hard that she felt her surgical staples would rip open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After her surgeries, she said she'll never be able to carry her own child, but hopes she and her husband can use a &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/surrogate-paid-22500-and-30000-twice-said-experience-was-empowering-2024-6" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;surrogate&lt;/a&gt; one day.&lt;/p&gt;

                        &lt;/figure&gt;
                      &lt;p&gt;It's hard to picture her future, she said. "It's just natural when you're at this age — you're always thinking about what's next," whether it's planning a trip, renovating her house, or having kids. At the same time, she never knows if she can commit to a family gathering or if she'll feel too sick to attend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She savors every moment with her loved ones, a contrast to her "busybody" life as a nurse prior to cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I try not to focus on that three-year mark because that's just a statistic," she said. "That's not me."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The funding was made through the society’s &lt;a href="https://www.nationalmssociety.org/about-the-society/who-we-are/research-we-fund/fast-forward-commercial"&gt;Fast Forward program&lt;/a&gt;, which seeks to bridge the gap between preclinical and clinical development for new therapies and diagnostic tools that address disease progression and progressive forms of MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://myrotx.com/"&gt;Myrobalan&lt;/a&gt;‘s experimental therapy MRO-002 is a GPR17 antagonist, or inhibitor, that’s designed to promote myelin repair in people with MS and other demyelinating conditions. With the grant, the company will conduct additional preclinical experiments to determine if it may have therapeutic benefits in progressive MS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are excited to receive the Fast Forward grant from the National MS Society and appreciate their confidence in our drug development approach,” Jing Wang, PhD, CEO and co-founder of Myrobalan, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250312951560/en/Myrobalan-Therapeutics-Awarded-a-Grant-from-the-National-Multiple-Sclerosis-Society-to-Advance-Development-of-MRO-002-in-Multiple-Sclerosis"&gt;company press release&lt;/a&gt;. “We believe that MRO-002 has the potential to promote myelin repair in neurodegenerative diseases, demyelinating disorders, and conditions involving recovery from [central nervous system] injury.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Finding ways to aid myelin repair&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In MS, the immune system mistakenly attacks the &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/myelin-sheath/"&gt;myelin sheath&lt;/a&gt;, a fatty coating around nerve cells. Like an insulator on electrical wires, myelin protects nerve fibers and ensures the efficient transmission of nerve signals. When it’s lost, patients experience a &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/symptoms-of-multiple-sclerosis/"&gt;range of symptoms&lt;/a&gt; related to disrupted nerve signaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Myelin is produced by oligodendrocytes, specialized cells in the brain and spinal cord. While existing oligodendrocytes have some ability to repair damaged myelin or restore lost myelin, the remyelination process isn’t very efficient in MS due to ongoing inflammation. There’s also insufficient maturation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) into fully functional oligodendrocytes that are able to produce myelin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key challenge in MS treatment is the repair of damaged myelin. While available &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/treatments-that-modify-the-disease-course/"&gt;disease-modifying therapies&lt;/a&gt; help reduce relapses and slow disease progression, their ability to repair myelin and reverse disability is limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding therapies that can improve remyelination has been a longstanding goal in MS research. One promising approach involves targeting GPR17, a receptor in OPCs that prevents the cells from maturing into fully functional oligodendrocytes, thereby limiting myelin repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MRO-002 is a highly selective GPR17 antagonist that can cross the blood-brain barrier, the protective membrane that restricts the passage of most substances from the bloodstream into the brain. This ability lets it reach the brain and remove this brake from OPCs, causing them to mature and boosting the production of new myelin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preclinical studies on human-derived oligodendrocytes and animal models of demyelination &lt;a href="https://myrotx.com/news/myrobalan-to-present-gpr17-antagonist-preclinical-data-at-ectrims-2024/"&gt;have shown encouraging results&lt;/a&gt;. MRO-002 significantly boosted the maturation of oligodendrocytes in both models, resulting in enhanced remyelination in the brains of the animals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With support from the National MS Society, the company hopes to conduct additional studies to support MRO-002’s development toward clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Having a therapy that promotes myelin repair would have tremendous implications for people living with MS,” said Walter Kostich, PhD, associate vice president of translational research at the National MS Society. “We are happy to support Myrobalan Therapeutics’ preclinical testing of MRO-002 and look forward to learning whether it has translational potential for people with MS.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A United Nations food agency warned that the continued spread of the H5N1 bird flu virus is an unprecedented food security risk that requires a coordinated global response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a briefing held on Monday, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations cited the loss of hundreds of millions of poultry around the world and the increasing spillover into mammals as key concerns stemming from the spread of the H5N1 bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The agency noted a major shift in bird flu’s geographic spread in the past four years, with at least 300 newly affected wild bird species since 2021.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Calling the spread unprecedented, FAO Deputy Director-General Godfrey Magwenzi said the disease was “leading to serious impacts on food security and food supply in countries, including loss of valuable nutrition, rural jobs and income, shocks to local economies, and of course increasing costs to consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;FAO Deputy Director-General Beth Bechdol called for a coordinated global response, saying, “A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. By working together, we can reduce the impact of avian influenza and protect both animal and human health – locally and globally.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The agency called on countries to enhance surveillance and reporting of bird flu; improve lab capacity; develop and implement preparedness plans; consider vaccinations in the response; and to promote risk management through biosecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2n-player" data-stn-player="k036p9v5" data-s2n-api="minuteMediaS2NApi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. has 70 cases of bird flu, including 41 cattle herds as well as 24 poultry farms and culling operations. As a zoological disease, there have been no reported cases of human-to-human transmission so far and the risk to the public remains low.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last month, the Department of Agriculture &lt;a href="https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/02/26/usda-invests-1-billion-combat-avian-flu-and-reduce-egg-prices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;released a plan&lt;/a&gt; to invest $1 billion to combat the bird flu and reduce egg prices.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In Mississippi, a strain of highly pathogenic bird flu that hasn’t been seen in the U.S. since 2017 was &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5199450-mississippi-reports-first-outbreak-of-highly-pathogenic-bird-flu-strain-in-us-since-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reported in a commercial flock&lt;/a&gt;. This occurrence is believed to be unrelated to the current H5N1 spread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The disease has been credited with causing egg prices to spike, and restaurants have begun implementing surcharges for egg dishes. The Justice Department, however, is also &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doj-investigating-major-egg-producers-amid-soaring-prices/story?id=119589959" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;reportedly investigating&lt;/a&gt; whether major egg producers are colluding to increase prices while using the bird flu situation as a cover.&lt;/p&gt;

Stop immediately if you experience pain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may seem hard to believe, but snacking several times a day can boost your health and fitness — exercise snacking, that is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exercise snacks” are short bursts of activity — 30 seconds to five or 10 minutes max — that encompass almost any type of movement. Think climbing stairs, walking, doing squats or dancing. The term is thought to have been first used in 2007 by cardiologist Dr. Howard Hartley, who was then associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Today, numerous studies prove the value of these mini workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Performing 15- to 30-second exercise snacks three times daily was shown to improve the cardiorespiratory fitness levels and exercise performance in inactive adults, according to a small January 2022 study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-essr/fulltext/2022/01000/exercise_snacks__a_novel_strategy_to_improve.5.aspx" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Exercise and Sport Sciences Reviews;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Exercise and Sport Sciences Reviews&lt;/a&gt;. The “snacks” in the study were stair-climbing and cycling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults who reported they didn’t work out saw a 17% to 18% reduction in cancer incidence after they began doing just 3.4 to 3.6 minutes of vigorous physical activity daily, a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10375384/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:July 2023 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;July 2023 study&lt;/a&gt; of 22,398 people found. Their daily physical activity was done in bursts lasting less than one or two minutes. Hitting 4.5 minutes of vigorous, intermittent physical activity each day was associated with a 31% to 32% reduction in cancer incidence, according to the study published in JAMA Oncology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of movement extend to brain health, too. Doing even a small amount of moderate to vigorous physical activity every day, or adding a small amount to your current exercise regimen, reduces your risk of dementia, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.jamda.com/article/S1525-8610(24)00879-X/abstract" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:March study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;March study&lt;/a&gt; in JAMDA: The Journal of the Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medical Association. Those who hadn’t been doing any moderate to vigorous exercise received the largest benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Doing anything is better than doing nothing,” said Michael Betts, a personal trainer and director at TrainFitness who’s based in London. “As long as you’re moving some of the time, putting a little stress on your body, it will adapt and improve.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Climbing the stairs as you go about your day can be one way to work in an exercise snack. - South_agency/E+/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Small changes can result in big rewards&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise snacks are a favorite tool used by Dr. Supatra Tovar, owner of Dr. Supatra Tovar &amp;amp; Associates, a holistic health clinical psychology practice in Pasadena, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m a big proponent of behavior change that starts tiny,” Tovar said. “So I like to create behaviors with my clients that are easy, accessible and doable every to most every day of the week.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to making tiny, new changes stick is to tie them to a behavior you do every day at the same time, Tovar said. For example, if you immediately brush your teeth upon waking up, start doing a few jumping jacks or lunges as soon as you set down your toothbrush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you incorporate exercise snacks as a habit, they start to become ingrained, and you’ll begin to see their lifelong benefits,” Tovar said. “Anyone I’ve given these to have reported back that they had no idea how much of a positive difference they would make.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is one of the easiest exercise snacks, according to Tovar and Betts. It can entail a stroll around your neighborhood or just a lap around your living room. Once you get in the habit of walking a little each day, you can progress to doing intervals, increasing your pace for 20 seconds, slowing down for 10 and then repeating several times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It pushes your body a little more each time,” Betts said, “after which your body adapts and improves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don’t rely just on walking. Wall push-ups will build strength in your arms, for example, while squats are great for beefing up your leg strength. If you want to be able to climb stairs without getting out of breath, start walking up and down stairs a little more quickly than you normally would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s always an exercise snack that can help improve each part of your body in some way,” Betts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also make any exercise snack more difficult if it becomes too easy. A wall push-up can progress to one performed on the floor, while a chair squat can become an air squat. An easy stroll can turn into a light jog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Exercise snacks are a NEAT hack&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise snacks don’t have to be a specific type of activity, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cleaning your house is exercise,” said Tovar, who is a fan of NEAT movements. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12468415/#:~:text=Non%2Dexercise%20activity%20thermogenesis%20(NEAT)%20is%20the%20energy%20expended,undertaking%20agricultural%20tasks%20and%20fidgeting." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:NEAT;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;NEAT&lt;/a&gt;, or nonexercise activity thermogenesis, refers to the energy expended from all physical activities that aren’t structured exercise. Doing chores, playing with your kids and even fidgeting are all forms of NEAT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tovar points to people living in “blue zones,” which are areas around the globe where people routinely live long and healthy lives, such as Okinawa, Japan, and the Italian island of Sardinia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’re moving all of the time, doing NEAT exercise all day long,” she said, whether that’s walking to the store, squatting to garden, carrying groceries or doing chores. “NEAT exercise can burn up to 2,000 extra calories per day if you’re constantly moving throughout the day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All that motion is welcomed by the body and not a detriment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your body is kind of lazy,” Betts said. “It doesn’t like to do much and will slowly deteriorate over time without use. Doing these little exercise snacks reminds your body that it does need to work to maintain and improve its overall function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sign up for CNN’s Fitness, But Better newsletter series. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/newsletters/fitness-life-but-better" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Our seven-part guide will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our seven-part guide will help you ease into a healthy routine, backed by experts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://thethousandmiler.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Melanie Radzicki McManus;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Melanie Radzicki McManus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is a freelance writer who specializes in hiking, travel and fitness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/account/register?source=external-feeds_iluminar&amp;amp;cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo&amp;amp;registration_email_campaign=https://www.cnn.com/newsletters" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CNN.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CNN.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 16:14:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE45Q0dReWpLRHgxV3ZVMXZRRUpFM3FNS0lvWWR1VGFZTXlpUEhZdURsVDBzM0xrM25iMlZRZW1ITFNEcUk2RGVSaWpNWWlqbzFJMVNrMDVYdEMxQlc2U3JaS1oybjFBU2JDdnhuaWtvRDV5d1k</guid></item><item><title>Why doctors are giving some patients prescriptions for food - KSL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxORnZScll2RUtObWoyMkN0TXk3UFFkaTFmSTc1QzFWOG4yMnhJXzg3aHE2RlRNUkZRdzh0SUJRdEpFdUZVRjBNRFYzX1BmSFhTUk5raXgwekxTd3JBaW5rUnJseEhvT096TG9lWVU5SGdYTlhfTlo0TkdiOXhDanJzNlZwQ1JmcVROMWRrcWVBTUVjNmthRzRMbWw1UEpGdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;

Yet in health care, we don't really talk about that much," said Dr. Amy Locke, whose many titles include chief wellness officer at University of Utah Health, professor and co-director of the Driving Out Diabetes Initiative at the Osher Center for Integrative Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Locke said modifiable health risk factors are about 20% clinical, 30% behaviors like getting enough sleep or eating well, roughly 10% physical environment and 40% socioeconomic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you have good health care and you have good socioeconomic status, it's easier to eat a healthy diet," she told Deseret News. "What we want to do is use the health care space to leverage those other buckets as much as possible, so we are doing a bunch of 'Food Is Medicine'-related things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal government, health care providers, nonprofits, academics and others are embracing the concept that you can be healthier or sicker depending on what you eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sarah Zou, clinical dietician, gives two bags of food to Alma Rivera, who is eight months pregnant and has gestational diabetes, from the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy trailer parked outside of Greenwood Health Center in Midvale on Friday. (Photo: Kristin Murphy, Deseret News)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2022 White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition and Health firmly tied together food and health in its call to end hunger and reduce chronic disease by 2030, as the &lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/our-work/nutrition-physical-activity/food-medicine" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion&lt;/a&gt; reports. The office said 60% of U.S. adults have some diet-related chronic disease that the right food — and avoiding the wrong ones — can impact. At the same time, there are 18 million people whose households experience food insecurity. The result is an estimated $4 trillion in health care spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deseret News looked at two of the dozens of examples of "Food Is Medicine" programs. How programs operate and who they target varies. But many of them — including the University of Utah Food Pharmacy and the pilot project funded by the Rockefeller Foundation involving Salt Lake area veterans who receive services at the VA — share certain traits: The beneficiaries like Hutton and Rivera have medical conditions that food impacts. Participants are considered food insecure and meet income qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The programs also both have strong education components to help those benefiting understand why food matters, how to make good food choices and even how easy it is to make good meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also both provide actual food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Food is pictured in the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy trailer parked outside of Greenwood Health Center in Midvale on Friday. (Photo: Kristin Murphy, Deseret News)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Helping veterans get healthy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Veterans Health Administration hosted a bipartisan Congressional event last week to tout its partnership with the foundation, which just made a $100 million commitment to Food Is Medicine programs, building on its prescription pilot projects in Utah and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Projects are being launched in Maryland and New York, with partners including the VA, Instacart, Syracuse University, University of Utah, 4P Foods, as well as in North Carolina, Duke University and Reinvestment Partners. The programs have different designs to meet needs in the areas they serve. But the classes, resources and prescriptions are tailored specifically to patients and their chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hutton is one of 275 veterans in the Utah pilot; the programs combined hope to help 2,000 veterans, while gathering research and looking for ways to tackle diet-related diseases like diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure among U.S. veterans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with food education, veterans in the program are given gift cards worth $100 a month that can be used to buy fruits and vegetables at participating stores. The program lasts 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retired four-star U.S. Navy Admiral James Stavridis, foundation board chair, said access to healthy food improves mental and physical health while lowering the cost of health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sarah Zou, clinical dietician, helps a patient choose groceries at the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy trailer parked outside of Greenwood Health Center in Midvale on Friday. (Photo: Kristin Murphy, Deseret News)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Institutes of Health has reported that three-quarters of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan were overweight or obese when they first went to a VA clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noah Cohen-Cline, director of the Rockefeller Foundation initiative, said the program uses Food Is Medicine initiatives like produce prescriptions, meals tailored to medical needs and groceries that can be prescribed by a clinician as part of medical treatment, "with the big-picture goal of seeing these interventions formally integrated into health care as a covered medical benefit." These pilot projects are testing programs and measuring outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The foundation would love to expand it to all eligible veterans, including 116,000 in Utah, but Cohen-Cline said philanthropies alone can't meet the need; that requires funding from other sources, including health care systems and insurance companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said it saves money and improves quality of life, making it a great investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Ellen Maxfield, University of Utah Health clinical operations associate director, and Sarah Zou, clinical dietician, help a patient choose food from the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy trailer parked outside of Greenwood Health Center in Midvale on Friday.

You should not show up at a medical facility and not have the opportunity to talk about food," Locke said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.deseret.com/lifestyle/2025/03/17/food-medicine-prescription-fruits-vegetables-vets-disease-education/" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;Read the full article at Deseret.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The good news? Exercise can help and this study shed light on which type works best.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Key findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed clinical trials published up to October 2022, comparing different forms of physical exercise with routine activities, standard care, or sleep education. All participants had been formally diagnosed with insomnia and their sleep quality was measured using the Global Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (GPSQI).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study reviewed data from 24 clinical trials involving 2,045 adults aged 60 and older, with an average age of 70. Most of these trials took place in Asia (56%), followed by North America (16%), South America (16%), and Europe (12%). One in five were conducted in nursing homes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Which exercises were studied?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed different types of exercise, including:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aerobic exercise – Activities like cycling, brisk walking, swimming, and dancing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Resistance training – Weightlifting, push-ups, squats and planks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Balance exercises – Movements like heel-to-toe walking and step-ups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flexibility exercises – Yoga, Pilates, and stretching routines.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Combination exercise – A mix of strength, aerobic, balance and flexibility workouts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average exercise session lasted around 50 minutes, with participants working out two to three times per week for about 14 weeks. However, due to limited data, the meta-analysis focused primarily on aerobic and combination exercises, with the impact of resistance training extrapolated through network analysis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How much did sleep improve?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strength training improved sleep the most, boosting GPSQI scores by 5.75 points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aerobic exercise improved scores by 3.76 points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Combination exercise improved scores by 2.54 points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sleep education helped but was less effective than strength training.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While sleep education did show benefits, the study noted inconsistencies in how it was defined across trials, making it difficult to assess its full impact.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Why strength training works best&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the experts, strength training may enhance sleep by reducing stress, improving metabolism and promoting the release of sleep-regulating hormones. Unlike high-intensity aerobic workouts, resistance training does not overstimulate the nervous system, making it easier for older adults to wind down before bed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The takeaway: Exercise your way to better sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While all forms of exercise are beneficial, resistance training appears to have the greatest impact on sleep quality for older adults. If you are looking for a natural way to improve your sleep, consider adding strength training to your routine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;figure class="inlineIMG"&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;img data-src="https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/03/06/original/shutterstock_1555847276_1741253064032.jpg" class="lazy" src="https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg" alt="Strength training, aerobic training and combination activities can help in regularising sleep.(Shutterstock)" title="Strength training, aerobic training and combination activities can help in regularising sleep.(Shutterstock)"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Strength training, aerobic training and combination activities can help in regularising sleep.(Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether it is lifting weights, doing bodyweight exercises or using resistance bands, a little strength work could lead to more restful nights and better overall health.

What happened?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“People tend to think of allergies as a childhood thing” and not something they can get later in life, said Dr. Tolly Epstein, an adjunct assistant professor at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine who researches allergies and immunology. But “it’s very common to develop new allergies,” especially in your 20s, 30s and 40s, she said. And the symptoms aren’t always obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Most people with seasonal allergies will have sneezing, itchy eyes or nasal congestion. But those can also be accompanied by fatigue, a headache or sinus pressure — which, if you’ve never faced allergies before, you might mistake as cold symptoms, Dr. Epstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;If you’ve recently developed a pollen allergy, you might also experience itching in your mouth after eating certain raw fruits and vegetables, said Dr. Andrew Rorie, an assistant professor in the Division of Allergy and Immunology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. That’s because the immune system sometimes confuses proteins in the plants for pollen proteins, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-25133f37"&gt;What causes seasonal allergies to develop?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Seasonal allergies are reactions to environmental elements like pollen or mold spores that tend to swirl around in the air during certain times — such as in the spring, when plants pollinate. When you’re allergic to something like pollen, your immune system perceives it as a threat and triggers a chain reaction at the point of exposure.

battles another, separate outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The infant was unvaccinated, officials said, and was hospitalized for the disease before being discharged to recover at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The case is not connected to the major outbreak in West Texas, where 294 people have been sickened across three states — marking &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14500321/measles-outbreak-texas-new-mexico-doctors-reveal-infected-people-unvaccinated.html"&gt;more cases than recorded&lt;/a&gt; across the entire US in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last month, an unvaccinated school-girl also died from measles in the outbreak, the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14487651/texas-father-daughter-measles-death.html"&gt;first US death from the disease in a decade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new infection is also not connected to the two cases in unvaccinated adults recorded in Houston in January, who were the city's first since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials say they are now tracing anyone who was in close contact with the patient and asking them to isolate. It was not immediately clear whether they traveled through the main airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patient was not reported to be a US resident, and no further information was given — including on when they arrived or where they traveled from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A spokesman from the Houston Department of Health told DailyMail.com that no further details on the case were being released in order to protect the patient's privacy.

The above picture is a stock image of a child suffering from measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is one of the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14447249/us-states-red-alert-measles-outbreak-kills-infects.html"&gt;most infectious diseases known to man&lt;/a&gt;, able to infect nine out of ten unvaccinated people that are exposed to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr David Persse, chief medical officer for Houston, urged people to get vaccinated against measles to slash their risk of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The best way to protect yourself and your loved ones from measles is through vaccination,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine is safe, highly effective, and remains the best defense against this potentially severe disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Although measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000, international travel continues to present a risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Staying up to date on vaccinations helps protect both individuals and the broader community.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 92 percent of kindergarteners across Texas were vaccinated against measles in 2023 to 2024, the latest data available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is below the 95 percent level experts say is needed to prevent an outbreak, and below the levels recorded in previous years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the Houston area, three of its private schools are among those with the lowest vaccination rates in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acton Leadership Academy of Magnolia, north of the city, had a measles vaccination rate of 36 percent in 2023 to 2024, according to state data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Acton Academy Cy-Fair, in northwest Houston, had a measles vaccination rate of 50 percent for kindergarteners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above is a stock image of the skyline in Houston, Texas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And Acton Leadership Academy of Creekside, in Spring, also had a measles vaccination rate of 50 percent for the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The two cases recorded in the city in January were in two unvaccinated adults living in the same household who had recently returned to the city from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their cases also were not linked to the major outbreak in West Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is one of the most infectious diseases known to man, and can infect nine in every ten people exposed to it who are unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It spreads via respiratory droplets expelled in coughs and sneezes that hang in the air and remain infectious for up to two hours after a patient has passed through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms erupt seven to 14 days after infection, and begin as a high fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients also suffer from a red, blotchy rash that starts on the face and then extends behind the ears and down the trunk to the rest of the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Serious complications can occur in young children or those with a weakened immune system, who may suffer from pneumonia, brain swelling and even death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles has a fatality rate of one to two children in every thousand who are infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The best way to prevent the infection is to be vaccinated, with the first dose given around six months and the second at the ages four to six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Treatment for the disease includes providing medications to help relieve symptoms and bed rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="cdc-textblock"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is issuing this Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Update to provide additional information to healthcare providers, public health departments, and the public about the ongoing risk of dengue virus (DENV) infections and updates to testing recommendations in the United States. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/outbreaks/2024/index.html"&gt;Dengue activity remains high in some parts of the United States&lt;/a&gt; and globally, with many countries reporting higher-than-usual number of &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/level1/dengue-global"&gt;dengue cases&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 and 2025. Healthcare providers, public health departments, and the public are urged to continue to take steps to prevent, detect, diagnose, and respond to dengue as described in the June 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00511.html"&gt;HAN Health Advisory (CDCHAN-00511)&lt;/a&gt; on dengue in the United States. Updates include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dengue virus transmission remains high in the Americas region, including in the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Spring and summer travel coincide with the peak season for dengue in many countries, increasing the risk of both travel-associated and locally acquired cases in the United States.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/hcp/diagnosis-testing/cdc-denv-1-4-real-time-rt-pcr-multiplex-assay.html"&gt;CDC DENV-1-4 real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay&lt;/a&gt; when dengue is the most likely diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New resources are available for public health professionals including a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/php/resources/medical_records_review.html"&gt;job aid&lt;/a&gt; for reviewing medical records and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/media/pdfs/2024/08/response_to_dengue.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;guidance&lt;span aria-label="pdf icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-pdf x16 fill-pdf" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="file-details"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for investigating and responding to dengue cases in non-endemic areas of the United States.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/about/index.html"&gt;Dengue&lt;/a&gt; is caused by four distinct but closely related dengue viruses or serotypes (DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4). Infection with one DENV usually induces lifelong immunity to that serotype and short-term immunity to other DENV serotypes for months to years. Repeat infections with different serotypes can occur, particularly in DENV endemic areas. Approximately one in four DENV infections are symptomatic. Infection with any DENV serotype can cause severe illness, particularly in infants aged ≤1 year, pregnant women, adults aged ≥65 years, people with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/media/pdfs/2024/05/20240521_342849-B_PRESS_READY_PocketGuideDCMC_UPDATE.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;certain medical conditions&lt;span aria-label="pdf icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-pdf x16 fill-pdf" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="file-details"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and people with previous DENV infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Globally, dengue cases have &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON518" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="int"&gt;increased substantially in the last 5 years&lt;span aria-label="external icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-external x16 fill-external" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with the most pronounced increases occurring in the Americas. &lt;a href="https://www3.paho.org/data/index.php/en/mnu-topics/indicadores-dengue-en.html" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="org"&gt;In the Americas region&lt;span aria-label="external icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-external x16 fill-external" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 4.6 million cases and 2,400 deaths were reported in 2023, followed by 13 million cases and 8,200 deaths in 2024. As of March 6, more than 760,000 dengue cases have been reported in 2025, which is a 15% increase compared to the previous 5-year average. Epidemics in the Americas region are expected to increase both travel-associated cases and the possibility of local transmission in the continental United States in areas with competent mosquito vectors. Spring and summer travel in the United States overlaps with the months of increased seasonal dengue activity in many countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All four DENV serotypes were reported among travelers returning to the United States in 2024. DENV-3 was the most common serotype identified in 2024, but the proportion of cases caused by DENV-4 has been increasing in recent months. During October 2024–January 2025, DENV-4 was identified in 50% of travel-associated dengue cases among cases with DENV serotype available. In addition, &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/news/10-2-2025-paho-warns-increased-risk-dengue-outbreaks-due-circulation-denv-3-americas" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="org"&gt;DENV-3 has re-emerged after a prolonged absence in multiple countries&lt;span aria-label="external icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-external x16 fill-external" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; across the Americas region during 2024 and 2025. Introductions of new serotypes have been associated with increasing size and frequency of dengue outbreaks, as well as more severe clinical outcomes in patients with previous DENV exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Puerto Rico, reported dengue cases have remained above the outbreak threshold since February 2024. A public health emergency was declared in March 2024 and remains in effect. In 2024, &lt;a href="https://datos.salud.pr.gov/arbovirus/publications" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="gov"&gt;6,291 cases were reported&lt;span aria-label="external icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-external x16 fill-external" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, more than 52% (3,292) required hospitalization and there were 13 deaths. As of March 7, 2025, 936 cases have been reported, representing a 113% increase compared to the same period in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S. Virgin Islands, a dengue outbreak was declared in August 2024 and remains in effect. A total of 208 locally acquired cases were identified in 2024, and 30 in 2025 as of March 7, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the continental United States in 2024, locally acquired cases were reported in &lt;a href="https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/mosquito-borne-diseases/_documents/2025-7-arbovirus-surveillance.pdf" target="_blank" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="gov"&gt;Florida&lt;span aria-label="pdf icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-pdf x16 fill-pdf" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="file-details"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-label="external icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-external x16 fill-external" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (91), California (18), and Texas (1). A record number of dengue cases were identified among U.S. travelers (3,483 cases), which is an 84% increase compared to the previous year. This trend is expected to continue with increased dengue activity in endemic areas in 2025. The highest numbers of travel-associated cases in 2024 were reported in &lt;a href="https://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/mosquito-borne-diseases/_documents/2025-7-arbovirus-surveillance.pdf" target="_blank" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="gov"&gt;Florida&lt;span aria-label="pdf icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-pdf x16 fill-pdf" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="file-details"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-label="external icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-external x16 fill-external" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (1,016) followed by &lt;a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/DengueInfectionsUpdate.aspx" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="gov"&gt;California&lt;span aria-label="external icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-external x16 fill-external" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (648), and New York (327).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDC will continue to support state, tribal, local, and territorial public health partners; clinicians; and public health laboratories in case detection, surveillance, and outreach to respond to the ongoing threat of dengue in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Healthcare Providers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review and be familiar with the recommendations for healthcare providers in the June 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00511.html"&gt;HAN (CDCHAN-00511)&lt;/a&gt; on dengue in the United States. This includes information about reporting cases, clinical presentation and care (including severe dengue), vaccination, testing, and patient outreach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a thorough travel history for patients presenting with acute febrile illness as initial clinical presentation is similar among many vector-borne diseases such as &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/index.html"&gt;dengue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/zika/index.html"&gt;Zika&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/about/index.html"&gt;chikungunya&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/about/index.html"&gt;Oropouche&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advise patients who plan to travel to take steps to prevent mosquito bites during travel and for 3 weeks after returning, especially if traveling to an area with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/areas-with-risk/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/areaswithrisk/around-the-world.html"&gt;frequent or continuous dengue transmission&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue to have increased suspicion of dengue among people with fever who have been in areas with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/areas-with-risk/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/areaswithrisk/around-the-world.html"&gt;frequent or continuous dengue transmission&lt;/a&gt; within 14 days before illness onset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patients with suspected DENV infection should be tested with RT-PCR (i.e., a nucleic acid amplification test [NAAT]) or an NS1 antigen test, as well as with an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antibody test. These tests are available from commercial laboratories and public health laboratories. You can contact your &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/public-health-gateway/php/communications-resources/health-department-directories.html"&gt;state or local health department&lt;/a&gt; to facilitate dengue diagnostic testing.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These tests can be considered regardless of the symptom onset date, although the sensitivity of RT-PCR and NS1 antigen tests decrease after the first 7 days of symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the patient test negative for dengue, consider testing for other infectious diseases that might be occurring in the location where the patient was likely exposed. Zika, chikungunya, and Oropouche can all have similar clinical signs and symptoms and often circulate in the same areas as dengue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendations for Health Departments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review and be familiar with the recommendations for state, tribal, local, and territorial Health Departments in the June 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2024/han00511.html"&gt;HAN (CDCHAN-00511) on dengue in the United States&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consider using the new &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/php/resources/medical_records_review.html"&gt;job aid for reviewing dengue medical records&lt;/a&gt; when reviewing data from medical records for case investigations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When selecting an RT-PCR assay, use the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/hcp/diagnosis-testing/cdc-denv-1-4-real-time-rt-pcr-multiplex-assay.html"&gt;CDC DENV-1-4 Real Time RT-PCR Assay&lt;/a&gt; when dengue is the most likely diagnosis. Use the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/123606/download" class="tp-link-policy" rel="noreferrer" data-domain-ext="gov"&gt;Trioplex Real Time RT-PCR assay&lt;span aria-label="external icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-external x16 fill-external" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (approved under an Emergency Use Authorization by the Food and Drug Administration), when Zika is the most likely diagnosis. For samples testing negative for dengue, consider RT-PCR testing for Oropouche virus (OROV) based on &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oropouche/data-maps/countries-and-territories-at-risk-for-oropouche.html"&gt;recent OROV circulation in locations visited.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Trioplex Real Time RT-PCR assay, which simultaneously tests for dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses, is less sensitive for DENV-4 compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/hcp/diagnosis-testing/cdc-denv-1-4-real-time-rt-pcr-multiplex-assay.html"&gt;DENV-1-4 Real Time RT-PCR assay&lt;/a&gt;, and DENV-4 has been detected more frequently among travelers returning to the United States in recent months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Public health laboratories can request technical support and test kits at &lt;a href="mailto:denguePCRordering@cdc.gov"&gt;denguePCRordering@cdc.gov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="mailto:trioplexPCRordering@cdc.gov"&gt;trioplexPCRordering@cdc.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oropouche RT-PCR testing is available commercially and at selected state health departments and CDC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Investigate, report, and respond to dengue cases and outbreaks in endemic and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/media/pdfs/2024/08/response_to_dengue.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;non-endemic areas of the United States.&lt;span aria-label="pdf icon" class="sr-only" role="img"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="fi cdc-icon-pdf x16 fill-pdf" alt="" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="file-details"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share guidance with the public about &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/prevention/index.html"&gt;preventing dengue&lt;/a&gt; and other vector-borne disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Your body adjusts, but it's a wonky time,' Pamela explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The thing with menopause, and perimenopause, is our bodies change, and it may not be comfortable in the beginning, some women can have hot flashes and other kinds of symptoms that are annoying, but they pass for most women, it's a transitional stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It doesn't last forever, and we're getting smarter now about menopause, and we're getting more educated, and most women in menopause do really well with estrogen and testosterone - with your hormones that they're losing during menopause - and when we get estrogen replaced, of which we naturally lose, it's like getting an incredible boost to shock.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pamela Madsen, a somatic sex educator, revealed what sex is like after menopause&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;She said women are 'starving' and need to be fed before the work begins&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pamela also called menopause a 'second adolescence' for women in their 40s, 50s, and 60s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'If you give her an estrogen testosterone cream, she's right back in the game. Pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'People should consult their doctors, but in my experience of working with so many mid-life women, they don't even need a lot of hormone replacement. They just need a little help.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Pamela broke down her Back to the Body retreats that allow women to get in touch with their sexual selves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said many women join her program who have had inadequate lovers or lovers who have never cared about their sexual needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They come in starving. So before we can get anywhere in helping them cultivate their erotic energy, we go through, literally, a period of feeding because they're so hungry,' she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The work, initially, with a menopausal woman, is getting her out of erotic poverty and getting her to a place where she's not starving anymore. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And then once we get her there, then we can support women to go even deeper into what is possible for themselves, erotically, like, "What turns you on? What do you want?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I have women say to me, no one has ever asked me that question before. What do I want?

Because their sexual capacity after menopause grows and older men sometimes can't keep up with us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So the perfect erotic match often can be the older woman and the younger man. He has the capacity to keep up with her ever-growing eroticism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She continued: 'Now, I'm not saying that we should just all be with older men. I'm saying that the phenomenon of older women with younger men makes erotic sense.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The sex expert then broke down another reason why younger men are more enticing.     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Women in menopause are not necessarily looking for the rich man, as &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/cher/index.html" id="mol-2a5d1eb1-0378-11f0-a7db-e5eee6e4215c"&gt;Cher&lt;/a&gt; said to her mother, "Mom, I am the rich man.’’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pamela runs Back to the Body which has retreats that allow women to get in touch with their sexual selves&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Something about that made me change the sense of where "I am financially independent.

She's looking for a man who can meet her erotically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She's often looking for a man who wants to travel and do things with her.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbm6s003phvm08dj07lyd@published"&gt;Measles is back. After the disease was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;declared eliminated&lt;/a&gt; in the United States in 2000, it was easy to feel like it was gone for good. But “eliminated” means there was no ongoing local spread. It’s not the same as “eradicated.” With &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;a few dozen cases&lt;/a&gt; popping up here and there each year, as soon as vaccination rates dip, the illness rears can rear its ugly head once more—just as it is right now.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="118" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbpsb000o3b73rgnpxow5@published"&gt;People have &lt;a href="https://gidmk.substack.com/p/the-problem-with-vaccines"&gt;mostly forgotten&lt;/a&gt; how bad measles can be. In a world where vaccination rates are typically above 95 percent, it’s incredibly rare to see even a single hospitalization for the condition. But, now, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/health/measles-outbreak-map.html"&gt;as outbreaks spread&lt;/a&gt;, parents across the country are desperately looking for a way to protect their children from an infection with a fatality rate of around 1 in 1,000. That might sound low, but compare it to COVID-19 in 2020 in children age 5: It’s around 100 times more deadly. And for kids who survive measles, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;there can be other nasty complications&lt;/a&gt;. For example, there is evidence that for some kids measles &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aay6485"&gt;permanently damages the immune system&lt;/a&gt;, leaving them more vulnerable to other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbptp000p3b73bou8d6a2@published"&gt;The obvious way to protect your family is simple: vaccination. The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is one of the safest medical interventions we have and provides extremely good protection against the disease. But Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the new head of the Department of Health and Human Services, &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/05/health/measles-rfk-vitamin-a-misinformation/index.html"&gt;has suggested&lt;/a&gt; that vitamin A supplements are just as useful as vaccines. “Studies have found that vitamin A can dramatically reduce measles mortality,” he &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us"&gt;wrote in an op-ed for Fox News&lt;/a&gt;. “Good nutrition remains a best defense against most chronic and infectious illnesses.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="38" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbpv9000q3b73i9j8yeuv@published"&gt;Unfortunately, the idea that good nutrition is a “best defense” simply isn’t true. You can eat a remarkably healthy diet and still become very ill. Vitamin A supplements do have some benefits—but they won’t protect your children from measles.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbpwy000r3b73j074vois@published"&gt;First, there is a &lt;em&gt;grain&lt;/em&gt; of truth to the idea that vitamin A can be a useful tool when it comes to measles. The vitamin is a molecule that your body uses for a wide range of purposes. One of the main things that it does is help you mount an effective immune defense. We have &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/41782/WHO_MONO_57_(part3).pdf"&gt;known for decades&lt;/a&gt; that people with very low vitamin A levels are at much higher risk of suffering and dying from many infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="29" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbpyp000s3b73adn7w1yu@published"&gt;To put it simply (in fact, perhaps too simply!): Vitamin A &lt;em&gt;deficiency&lt;/em&gt; causes you to be &lt;em&gt;particularly&lt;/em&gt; vulnerable to infectious disease, including measles. Correcting that deficiency solves this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="81" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbq09000t3b73b9u039lf@published"&gt;There are a number of studies from the ’80s and ’90s to back up this idea. &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199007193230304"&gt;A famous study&lt;/a&gt; found that a vitamin A supplement for children who were admitted to the hospital with measles reduced the risk of those kids dying by nearly 80 percent. &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008524.pub3/full"&gt;A 2017 review&lt;/a&gt; that aggregated a range of trials together did not show a benefit for mortality, but did find that the vitamin reduced the risk of children having a diagnosed case of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbq1q000u3b73w17mqpe9@published"&gt;These studies are why vitamin A supplementation is still recommended as a treatment for children who are hospitalized with measles. But the problem is that they don’t really have all that much relevance to children in the United States today. The famous study I mentioned above was conducted in 1987 in Cape Town in a mostly Black population at a time when the apartheid regime still held sway. The studies aggregated together in the 2017 review were mostly conducted in China, India, and Africa in the ’80s.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbq34000v3b73rwrxsowx@published"&gt;In most of these settings, vitamin A deficiency was not just common—it was ubiquitous. Some of these countries had deficiency rates above 20 percent. Meanwhile, the most recent and robust data we’ve got, &lt;a href="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(23)06551-6/pdf"&gt;from the ’90s&lt;/a&gt;, suggests that fewer than 1 in 100 children in the U.S. have a vitamin A deficiency. Some &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297552"&gt;even more recent data&lt;/a&gt; puts the rates even lower, although that study was mostly looking at pregnant women. This is perhaps not surprising in a world where you can get enough vitamin A dining exclusively on the McDonald’s menu.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbq4m000w3b739refw3pi@published"&gt;We also know that vitamin A supplements are unlikely to help kids who have enough vitamin A. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJM199010043231401"&gt;a massive 1990 study&lt;/a&gt; conducted in India showed that vitamin A supplements reduced the risk of kids dying from measles and other infectious diseases by more than half. However, all of this benefit was in children who showed very obvious signs of malnourishment, like stunted growth or skin clinging to their bones. Those kids had an 89 percent reduction in their risk of death.  Children who were not malnourished had no reduction in risk at all.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="131" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbq61000x3b732xjxjuhr@published"&gt;Also, things are actually little more complicated than “If you have a vitamin A deficiency, a supplement can protect against measles.” One of the largest trials ever conducted—in over 1 million children—&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673612621254?via%3Dihub#abs1"&gt;took place in northern India&lt;/a&gt; in the ’00s and calls that straightforward idea into question. In this region, vitamin A deficiency was very common. The study randomly allocated kids to either get a very high-dose vitamin A supplement or a placebo medication once every six months. At the end of the trial, death rates from measles and a variety of other diseases were the same, although the rate of vitamin A deficiency had dropped drastically in the supplement group. There was also no difference in the rate of diagnosed measles between vitamin A and a placebo in this massive trial.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="142" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbq7f000y3b73kswqh9xi@published"&gt;This seems to conflict with the evidence from the ’80s and ’90s that was summarized in the 2017 review I discussed above, but if you look closer, it makes sense. While vitamin A deficiency was still quite common in India in the ’00s—the study found rates of 10–15 percent without supplementation—the situation was still much better than it was two decades earlier. (&lt;a href="https://adc.bmj.com/content/72/4/330.abstract?casa_token=6UIl_iLFC94AAAAA:DcPRkDIpBdQhoafNY8FrndWv5x7RqT-tx71w7dE2iJaufNf1lDy-b6akTqP3wGB1tI7kS_mu_6M"&gt;For example, a study in 1993&lt;/a&gt; showed that rates of eye disease caused by vitamin A deficiency were 22 percent in Uttar Pradesh, where this large randomized trial was later conducted.) The point is that the more modern evidence does not seem to show as much benefit for vitamin A supplementation for measles (though there are benefits for other things). This could be because the rate of severe malnutrition has dropped globally since the first of these studies were conducted.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="69" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbq8x000z3b732btlrmcb@published"&gt;It’s also worth noting that none of these studies have tested the sort of supplement that you can buy in a supermarket or pharmacy. Most store-bought vitamin A supplements have somewhere between 300 and 1,500 micrograms of the substance in them. The average amount used in these studies—which, remember, are of kids with severe deficiency—is about 30,000 micrograms. That’s between 20 and 100 times higher than your average multivitamin.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="71" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbqab00103b73gg0nkvbz@published"&gt;If you live in an area with severe malnutrition, where kids are literally starving on the streets, then a vitamin A supplement is probably a good way to reduce your child’s risk of extremely nasty disease. But if you live in the U.S., where fewer than 1 in 100 kids have low vitamin A levels and even fewer have a true deficiency, the supplements probably aren’t going to do very much.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="52" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm8dkbqcb00113b733jnnny3w@published"&gt;Yes, your immune system can function better when you are not malnourished, but the best way to protect against measles is vaccination. Really, it’s not even an either/or proposition—feed your kids &lt;em&gt;and also&lt;/em&gt; get them vaccinated. We got rid of the disease for 25 years. There’s no need to bring it &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

PE is a medical emergency and needs to be treated immediately to avert death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ten hours into her flight from Toronto to Dubai, Emily Jansson got up from her window seat to use the lavatory. While waiting in line, she coughed weakly twice before collapsing, suffering a pulmonary embolism—life-threatening blood clots in her lungs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Jansson, who revealed her case on TikTok, was shocked by the incident, saying she had the 'heart of an athlete' because she regularly did long bike rides and cardio-intense workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not common to suffer a pulmonary embolism on a flight, with the complication affecting around one in 40,000 passengers on long-haul flights that exceed 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 900,000 people are diagnosed with PE in the US every year, with about 10 to 30 percent of patients dying within a month of diagnosis, according to the American Lung Association. It is ranked as the third-leading cause of cardiovascular death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In most cases, the condition is caused by a blood clot from the legs, called a deep vein thrombosis, traveling to the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Jansson also revealed that she was wearing compression socks, which Dr Bhatt said were not recommended for healthy people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: &lt;span&gt;'There's no evidence that in the context of people that are otherwise healthy that wearing these things on flights reduces blood clots, which is why I don’t generally recommend them for people.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But for people who have had certain blood clots that damage the veins 'we might recommend the socks to prevent swelling in the leg'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'At the minimum, in the seat, keep your legs moving and flex your ankles.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor also said it was important to stay hydrated on flights, which can also reduce the risk of clots forming by preventing blood from thickening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Emily Jansson, who landed on her face when she passed out, was also using hormonal birth control, which raises the production of certain clotting factors in the liver while reducing the production of proteins that help prevent excessive clotting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'In addition to getting up every couple of hours, it's important to stay well hydrated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It reduces the risk of blood clots forming in the vein, especially in the legs, which can break off and go to the lungs.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Deepak Bhatt, a top cardiologist at Mount Sinai, told DailyMail.com that getting up from one's cramped airplane seat and walking up and down the aisles for a few minutes can prevent potentially fatal blood clots&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also warned against drinking alcohol on flights, saying this was a diuretic and would prompt the body to lose water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even just a single drink, it’s not the end of the world, but it doesn't help the cause. You definitely do not want to drink alcohol for a variety of reasons,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And no one needs another drunk person on a flight.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Jansson, who had been traveling with her husband, said she had not moved on the flight for ten hours because it was very busy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘People are sleeping or eating. On top of that, they don’t really encourage you to get up and walk on flights and then there’s often turbulence so you have to be seated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Still, I wish I had gotten up to move around much more.’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Staying seated for extended periods can increase the risk of blood clots that travel from the legs to the lungs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sitting in a cramped airline seat restricts blood flow to the legs and back to the heart while the muscles in the legs that normally pump blood back to the heart are inactive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sitting in a cramped airline seat restricts blood flow to the legs while the muscles in the legs that normally pump blood back to the heart are inactive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Jansson's history of having a minor procedure to reduce varicose veins in her legs may have contributed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was also taking hormonal birth control, which increases the production of certain clotting factors in the liver while decreasing the production of anticoagulant proteins, which normally help prevent excessive clotting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 30 percent of people who experience PE do so a second time or more. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The health benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;1. Weight loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volunteers who followed the NiMe diet lost 1.4 per cent of their body weight over three weeks, according to the results published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell&lt;/em&gt;. For example, this would mean the typical man in the UK losing 2.5lb and the average woman losing 2.2lb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weight loss was despite participants eating the same number of calories as they usually would (around 2,500 calories for men and 2,000 for women).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A potential explanation would be that calories from whole plant foods are not as easily accessible by our digestive enzymes,” Prof Walter says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;2. Improved heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood tests revealed that levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, also known as “&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/heart-health/reduce-cholesterol-without-statins/"&gt;bad cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;” because it builds up in the arteries and raises the risk of heart attacks and stroke, decreased by 17 per cent after three weeks on the NiMe diet, results showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also a 14 per cent reduction in C-reactive protein – a marker for inflammation and heart disease, Prof Walter noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;3. Lowered Type 2 diabetes risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blood sugar decreased by 6 per cent among those following the NiMe diet, Prof Walter said. Blood tests also revealed an increase in indole-3-propionic acid – a metabolite that has been shown to protect against Type 2 diabetes and nerve damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;4. Enhanced gut health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On a Western diet low in dietary fibre, the gut microbiome degrades the mucus layer in the gut, which leads to inflammation,” Prof Walter explains. In contrast, the high-fibre NiMe diet helps to maintain this barrier which, in turn, reduces inflammation, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the study found that those following the NiMe diet had an increase in short-chain fatty acids in the gut, which help with digestion and immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;5. Lower cancer risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A low-fibre diet can force gut microbes to ferment (break down) protein because there is not enough fibre for them to ferment. “This generates harmful by-products that likely contribute to &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/cancer/colon-cancer/"&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;,” Prof Walter explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the study found that the NiMe diet increased carbohydrate fermentation in the gut, at the expense of protein fermentation, which reduced levels of metabolites linked to cancer, such as secondary bile acids and 8-hydroxyguanine, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the NiMe diet is very high in fibre, it can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, similar to other dishes high in onions or beans, such as bloating and gas, Prof Walter says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These symptoms vary among individuals,” he notes. “The diet might therefore not be the right choice for individuals that are intolerant to fibre.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How to incorporate the NiMe diet into your life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I follow the diet and I stick to it as much as I can,” says Prof Walter. He does the food shop for his household and sticks to buying ingredients that fit within the diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He found it difficult to stop eating, for the most part, cheese and processed meats, though he found it easy to give up ultra-processed foods. “But I still struggle with being too busy, so at lunch time, I still often have a sandwich, which would not be NiMe,” Prof Walter notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Who should follow the diet?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The data shows that the NiMe diet reduces risk indicators of important chronic diseases, including &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/diabetes/body-type-2-diabetes-symptoms-risk/"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, heart disease and cancer,” Prof Walters says. “So everyone who wants to stay healthy should benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A longer lifespean and more years spent in good health have been linked to healthy dietary patterns that are in line with the NiMe approach, he notes. Prof Walters plans to study whether the diet could also have this effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Recipes &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://era.library.ualberta.ca/items/54f2849f-fb67-4374-ad00-83f8787b0e2c" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The NiMe Diet: Scientific Principles and Recipes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Yellow pea soup&lt;/h2&gt;

[+]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="expanded-caption"&gt; new diabetes treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/fbs-accordion&gt;&lt;small&gt;Mount Sinai&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a venture investor in healthcare, I am privileged to witness the remarkable advances being made in the treatment and management of diabetes, a condition that affects over 537 million people globally. The prevalence of type 1 diabetes is expected to increase from 8.4 million to between 15 and 17 million by 2040. The urgency to find effective treatments and potential cures has never been greater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diabetes, whether type 1 or type 2, is characterized by a reduction in functional, insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells. This loss is a common thread that links both forms of diabetes, suggesting that strategies aimed at replenishing beta cells hold therapeutic promise. Traditional approaches, such as whole pancreas transplantation and pancreatic islet transplantation, have shown efficacy but are limited by high costs, the scarcity of donor organs, and the invasive nature of the procedures. It’s therefore imperative to also develop scalable, cost-effective solutions that can reach the millions affected by this chronic disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Quest For a Simple Pill&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For over 15 years, researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai have been at the forefront of diabetes research, striving to identify a drug capable of inducing the regeneration of human beta cells. In a significant breakthrough in 2015, they discovered harmine, a small molecule that is capable of stimulating beta cell replication. Esra Karakose, assistant professor in the Department of Medicine, is now studying the mechanism of action, and her team’s latest &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(24)00603-7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-medicine/fulltext/S2666-3791(24)00603-7" aria-label="publication"&gt;publication&lt;/a&gt; from an in vitro study suggests that harmine is inducing “fate conversion,” where alpha cells—another type of pancreatic cell—transform into beta-like cells capable of producing insulin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="vestpocket nsO6K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This revelation opens new avenues for treatment, as alpha cells are abundant in individuals with diabetes. By harnessing this potential, we may be able to address the underlying issue of beta cell loss in type 1 and type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="halfway_hardwall_4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, another group of researchers, including Andrew Stewart and Peng Wang, published another recent &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adg3456" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adg3456" aria-label="study"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in which they gave harmine alone or in combo with a GLP 1, to mice transplanted with human pancreatic islet cells. Harmine increased the human beta cell mass by 300% with harmine alone, and by 700% in combination with a GLP 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="fbs-ad--nativeinbody-d-wrapper fbs-ad--progressive"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The question was: how could we see such a dramatic increase in beta cell mass if the proliferation of beta cells was small?” Karakose said. “Now with my research, we believe that alpha to beta cell conversion was playing a role.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="article_paragraph_7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karakose is currently planning further experiments using advanced single-cell sequencing techniques to better understand the molecular pathways involved in this regeneration process, hoping to confirm her findings in human islet cells transplanted into mice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There are also clinical studies ongoing with harmine, and new studies are planned. It will certainly be interesting to follow whether the GLP-1s in combination with harmine truly do show a synergy in future human trials. If so, the dream of a simple, inexpensive pill that could serve as a solution for millions of people may not be so far out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Potentially Groundbreaking Cell Therapy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parallel, Sana Biotechnology is pioneering a revolutionary approach to islet cell transplantation for type 1 diabetes that circumvents the need for immunosuppression. Their innovative hypoimmune technology enables the transplantation of engineered islet cells without triggering an immune response. This &lt;a href="https://ir.sana.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sana-biotechnology-announces-positive-clinical-results-type-1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://ir.sana.com/news-releases/news-release-details/sana-biotechnology-announces-positive-clinical-results-type-1" aria-label="study"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; represents the first instance of a successful donor-derived islet cell transplantation in a fully immune-competent individual without the need for immunosuppressive therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This person is now making his own insulin for the first time in 30 years,” said Steve Harr, the President and CEO of Sana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, the rejection of transplanted cells has posed a significant challenge in transplant medicine, necessitating lifelong immunosuppression for recipients. Sana's approach, which includes gene modifications to create cells that evade both allogeneic and autoimmune detection, could fundamentally change the landscape of diabetes treatment. The implications of this research are profound, as it may pave the way for one-time treatments that restore insulin production in patients without the complications associated with immunosuppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to make this at a scale that can transform this disease globally,” Harr said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the recently announced study, the transplanted cells came from a cadaver, after which they were engineered to evade immune rejection. The next step in the program, says Harr, is to move away from cadaver-sourced cells, which provided a proof of concept, and instead use genetically modified pluripotent stem cells. Those could be grown into pancreatic cells suitable for transplant. There’s a virtually unlimited supply of stem cells that could be scaled up for such a commercial effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A cure for type 1 diabetes is now inevitable,” Harr says. “All the component parts have happened. The only things patients have to worry about are time, capital, safety, and scale. We really hope Sana gets to push all those forward, but whether we do or not, I’m confident someone will.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of others, on my trip to Bayer’s CoLab in Shanghai last year, I met with immunologist and stem cell researcher HongKui Deng of Peking University. He and his colleagues had just published an article in “&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39326417/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39326417/" aria-label="Cell"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt;” about a unique cell therapy approach for diabetes. While most such therapies have used cadaveric cells or cells derived from donors, Professor Deng is the first to demonstrate that it is possible to use the patient’s own cells in the treatment of diabetes. In the recently published study, his team chemically reprogrammed a 25-year-old patient’s cells into islet cells. Within two weeks after the transplant, the patient’s required daily dose of insulin began to decrease, and the patient “achieved complete insulin independence on day 75.” At the one-year follow-up mark, the patient still did not need insulin and had no transplant abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to following the various cell therapy approaches in development as they advance to the next clinical stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Role of Artificial Intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond pharmacological advancements, we are also witnessing a technological revolution in diabetes management through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI). A new &lt;a href="https://med.virginia.edu/diabetes-technology/2025/02/05/new-uva-clinical-trial-explores-ai-powered-insulin-delivery-for-better-diabetes-care/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ga-track="ExternalLink:https://med.virginia.edu/diabetes-technology/2025/02/05/new-uva-clinical-trial-explores-ai-powered-insulin-delivery-for-better-diabetes-care/" aria-label="clinical trial"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Virginia aims to assess an AI-powered insulin delivery system that utilizes reinforcement learning to improve automated insulin delivery. This system, known as the Bolus Priming System with Reinforcement Learning (BPS_RL), represents a significant leap forward in diabetes management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current automated insulin delivery systems require user input to adjust insulin doses, a process fraught with potential errors, particularly for vulnerable populations such as children and young adults. The updated software system seeks to close this loop, automating the dosing process based on glucose history and meal detection. By eliminating the need for user intervention, this technology promises to enhance blood sugar control, particularly during meals and overnight, thereby improving the quality of life for individuals living with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study will compare how well blood sugar levels are maintained in 16 diabetic adults with and without the AI-powered upgrade. If approved, this AI-powered system could be integrated into existing diabetes management systems, providing a seamless upgrade for hundreds of thousands of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Living with Type 1 diabetes is a full-time job,” said Heman Shakeri, assistant professor of data science at the University of Virginia, who is helping to develop the new AI system. “Kids will benefit the most. That’s why I get up early in morning, because the improvement can be so enormous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The convergence of these groundbreaking research efforts and technological innovations marks a pivotal moment in the fight against diabetes. And this is only a glimpse into what may be coming down the pike. In Leaps’ portfolio, for example, we have invested in Mozart Therapeutics, a clinical-stage biotech company testing a bispecific autoimmune checkpoint inhibitor for the treatment of early stage and slowly progressing autoimmune disease, like type 1 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vision of a world where diabetes is no longer a life-altering condition is becoming increasingly attainable. I am optimistic that the efforts of researchers, healthcare professionals, and technology innovators are paving the way for a future where diabetes management is more effective, accessible, and ultimately, curative.&lt;/p&gt;

The Texas emergency appears to have &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c"&gt;begun in an insular religious community&lt;/a&gt; with high vaccination exemption rates; &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-gaines-county-texas-religious-exemptions-cacdae1843fa918964a1b8e01fe757f5"&gt;14 percent&lt;/a&gt; of all children in Gaines County have exemptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The nation’s health leadership, meanwhile, is undermining the best defense against measles. While US health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us"&gt;paid lip service&lt;/a&gt; to the value of vaccines, he has also &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/doctors-push-back-parents-embrace-kennedy-vitamin-texas-measles-outbreak-2025-03-08/"&gt;pitched alternative treatments&lt;/a&gt; unsupported by medical science. He’s also launching new government &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/cdc-research-debunked-link-vaccines-autism-rcna195499"&gt;investigations&lt;/a&gt; into the long-debunked theory linking autism and vaccines — investigations seem designed to erode public trust in the measles shot’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html"&gt;safety&lt;/a&gt; at the very moment it is most needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;What’s happening right now could only be the beginning. The more the US strays from the public health playbook that helped the country to reach &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html#:~:text=Historic%20achievement,control%20in%20the%20Americas%20region."&gt;official measles elimination in 2000&lt;/a&gt;, the more outbreaks will likely occur — and the bigger they’ll be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We may be entering a new era when this once-dormant virus is again an active threat to people’s health. Here’s what you can do to protect yourself and your family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="you-really-really-dont-want-to-get-measles" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;You really, really don’t want to get measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Most Americans have been lucky enough to live in a world without measles, a disease that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-measles-vaccination/data-research/index.html#:~:text=107%2C500%20lives%20lost%20to%20measles%20worldwide%20in%202023%2C%20mostly%20children."&gt;globally still kills over 100,000 people&lt;/a&gt;, most of them young children. Its risks, therefore, have become largely hypothetical. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But for the unvaccinated, those risks are real. Measles is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7188204/#:~:text=Severe%20cases%20of%20measles%20require,1000%20cases%20results%20in%20death."&gt;a formidable and extremely contagious virus&lt;/a&gt;. It is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html"&gt;dangerous&lt;/a&gt; during the initial infection, which can lead to high fever and the signature measles rash, while some patients will go on to develop pneumonia or encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, both of which can be deadly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Measles has a fatality rate of 0.1 percent, but an estimated 20 percent of cases require hospitalization. The disease is particularly threatening to kids, especially young infants, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/12/health/measles-newborn-pregnancy-risks/index.html"&gt;pregnant women&lt;/a&gt; and people who are immunocompromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Some vaccine skeptics, including RFK Jr., &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/rfk-jr-it-would-be-better-if-everybody-got-measles/"&gt;downplay&lt;/a&gt; the risk of measles. “It used to be, when I was a kid, that everybody got measles. And the measles gave you lifetime protection against measles infection,” he said recently on Fox News. But measles was and is not some harmless disease: &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;Between 400 to 500 children&lt;/a&gt; died annually from measles in the US in the decade before a vaccine was introduced in 1963. From 1968 to 2016, there were about 550 measles deaths &lt;em&gt;total&lt;/em&gt; in the US, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Until the recent deaths in the Texas outbreak, it had been &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/03/texas-measles-outbreak-death-family/681985/"&gt;10 years&lt;/a&gt; since a single measles death had been recorded in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Even those who do survive a measles infection can face long-term health consequences, particularly for those in high-risk groups. Some of those infected in the current outbreak may be dealing with the fallout for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Measles can cause what’s known as &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay6485"&gt;immunity amnesia&lt;/a&gt;. The virus can wipe out more than half a person’s preexisting antibodies that protect them against other pathogens, which can leave them more vulnerable to other diseases for years after their infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In rare cases, measles can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-immune-system-brain-swelling-long-term-rcna195918"&gt;fatal brain swelling&lt;/a&gt; years after the initial infection. Patients can also suffer &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/measles-infection-symptoms-longterm-risks-rcna138583"&gt;hearing loss&lt;/a&gt; from ear infections experienced during their illness, while those who develop acute &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html"&gt;encephalitis&lt;/a&gt; can suffer permanent neurological damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="what-you-can-do-to-protect-yourself-from-measles" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;What you can do to protect yourself from measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Vaccination remains the best defense against measles: Two doses of the MMR vaccine — given to protect against measles, mumps, and rubella — is 97 percent effective at preventing a measles infection (and therefore spread). It is perhaps the most effective vaccine we have for any disease, and any risks from the vaccine are &lt;a href="https://x.com/PeterHotez/status/1899778505627385877"&gt;astonishingly low compared to the dangers of measles itself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In this new world where you’re more likely to see a measles outbreak in your community, people should consider taking steps to protect their health or that of their loved ones. Here’s what you can do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Parents, if you have young children—the group most at risk from measles — talk to your pediatrician about vaccination. The usual schedule is one shot around age 1 and another shot around age 5, but there is some flexibility. The CDC already &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html"&gt;advises&lt;/a&gt; that infants as young as 6 months can receive one dose if they are traveling internationally, and the recommended age for the second dose ranges from 4 to 6 years old. Several leading public health experts, including former CDC director Rochelle Walensky, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2831828?guestAccessKey=11aca00c-eba0-4515-a778-8658b1948f2e&amp;amp;cmp=1&amp;amp;utm_campaign=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8xNq-9YbIRf2vyGLZcTMVt0EC9kKiRgoZMecFTxqempP2dp4rrCwYJeVQLEgmatVbs4go0RyQUQl9Dx4BOdiZ1E8c1Ag&amp;amp;_hsmi=352150593&amp;amp;utm_content=media_advisory&amp;amp;utm_source=silverchair"&gt;wrote in a recent &lt;em&gt;JAMA&lt;/em&gt; op-ed&lt;/a&gt; that the recommendations should be updated to advise one shot for infants traveling in the US to areas with higher risk of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Reports of vaccinated people getting sick in Texas have at the same time raised questions about &lt;a href="/health/402025/texas-measles-outbreak-cases-mmr-vaccination"&gt;how protected vaccinated people actually are&lt;/a&gt;. As good as it is, 97 percent effectiveness isn’t 100 percent, and it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible to be vaccinated and still get sick. For a small percentage of people, the vaccine simply doesn’t produce immunity. It is also possible that immunity could wane over time, but that was previously not an issue because high vaccination rates had snuffed out the virus’s spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In part because there &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2025/03/04/measles-vaccine-shortage-rfk/"&gt;may not be a lot of excess vaccine supply&lt;/a&gt;, the priority should be vaccinating those people who do not have any protection at all: those very young children and the people who weren’t vaccinated as kids. Pregnant women &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-pregnancy/moms-to-be/index.html"&gt;should not&lt;/a&gt; receive the vaccine, but women planning to become pregnant could talk to their doctor about a booster shot; likewise, people with immune conditions &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/hcp/recommendations.html"&gt;should talk with their doctor&lt;/a&gt; before getting an additional dose, as the vaccine’s live virus could present a risk depending on their level of immunodeficiency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Those in high-risk groups may want to take additional precautions, such as wearing masks, if there are reports of measles infections in their immediate area. (That doesn’t just mean the areas of the current outbreak — isolated infections have also been found in &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/la-county-confirms-first-measles-case-in-resident/?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20First%20Edition&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_JrjkkkwQ9HjE95xaA9UB_rUsQjHTPv92TUFbSs6WgBLpIm-9tzeuHX42c-Ap25t5zZqycHTxXPY6xj2V9ZsPtGytFxg&amp;amp;_hsmi=351424356&amp;amp;utm_content=351424356&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wbaltv.com/article/measles-confirmed-case-maryland-howard-county/64111796"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt; in people who recently traveled internationally.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For other people who have already been vaccinated but are worried about transmission, it may be reasonable to consider a booster shot. But there are some important steps you should take first. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;First, check your vaccination records if you can find them. If you received two doses as a child, you very likely had a successful immune response; only three in 100 people &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html"&gt;don’t&lt;/a&gt;. If you received one dose — as was generally the case before 1989 — you’re probably still good, but it is a little more likely that you never developed immunity, &lt;a href="/health/402025/texas-measles-outbreak-cases-mmr-vaccination"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; Aaron Milstone, an infectious disease pediatrician at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Either way, the next step would be to talk to your doctor. (As always, with anything regarding your health.) They can administer a “titer test” that measures the measles antibodies in your body. If they’re still present — great, you should be good. If they’re not, you may want to ask your doctor about getting an additional measles shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The risks should be kept in context: If you’re not near a confirmed measles case, your personal risk remains negligible. If you’re vaccinated and have antibodies, you are very likely protected from the virus regardless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But they can not be ignored either. Milstone said he and his fellow infectious disease doctors could not believe it when they heard the news in February of a child’s death from measles in the United States of America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“You hope people don’t have to die for others to take this seriously,” Milstone said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vox.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 10:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxOY0tiMFNacG9TcTBscDZkMVRNTlZ6dFc5TVJITDRMMmVHUEI3RFRsclF4VUE0SnJFU0VIZjR2bU12cjY4U2NDN0tvN1RWUzNjOWVQeVpYYmhnTHZndDBCdUw1ZXhfeWx6dGRjV1czTU05OE8xZ1pKaHBGTFBqbllFVXlRN3R6OTY0U2JqVGhhTQ</guid></item><item><title>After COVID, Texas is less prepared for the next pandemic - The Texas Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE8xZFVweU1sWFBPUzJfMGc1ODhzNjdkZDl4VzdxXzEzTWxGMkZzOWJfcG4xUmtuUXVCRlV5VDRwZ05DM0pDckx6TTZGWm96TlQyakx0TmZvZ1kyd01td1BoV2Jqb0pVZ2NSQWRBRlJzZUI4b19fWDJkSjhTUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-story-body"&gt;

      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left t-dropcap"&gt;From the moment Steve Young canceled the Milam County Junior Livestock Association show, his days as county judge were numbered.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Young didn’t realize that at the time, of course. It was March 2020, a new virus was rapidly spreading around the country, and politics was the last thing this retired lawyer-turned-cattle rancher was thinking about. He was just doing what he felt needed to be done to keep the 25,000 residents of this rural county 90 minutes northeast of Austin safe.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;But the blowback was intense, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“People thought it was just wrong to cancel it, and this was a hoax and it was nothing worse than the flu,” he said in a recent interview. “This thing was highly politicized.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Many in Milam County supported Young as he closed businesses, required masks and turned vacant hospital buildings into a vaccine clinic, eventually offering families $250 to get their teens the shot. But those who opposed him were loud and virulent — he received death threats, and more than one person stormed into the office to yell at him.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Young remembers getting a call from another county official who warned him he was likely costing himself a job.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I said, ‘I understand that, but we need to do this,’” he said. “This is more important than a reelection. And if they don't like it and they want to run against me, then let them have it. In fact, if the guy wants to start tomorrow, tell him to come on.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;After two years of battling COVID-19 and the community, Young lost his seat to the former county Republican Party chair.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;It’s a story that played out across Texas, in small towns, big cities and all the way up to the governor’s mansion, as elected officials and public health workers became the punching bag for an angry, fearful public unused to government restrictions. Some, like Young, were chased out of public service. Others, like Gov. Greg Abbott, walked back their early support for public health mandates.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Texas entered the pandemic at a disadvantage, with an unhealthy and uninsured population, an underfunded public health system and workforce shortages across the health care system. While some hoped the pandemic might force improvements, five years after the first Texan died from COVID, many of these long-standing issues have worsened.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Today, Texas spends less per person on public health than it did before the pandemic. Fewer Texans are getting themselves or their kids vaccinated. Local officials have less power to protect their constituents during a health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Dozens of state and local health officials, health care workers, epidemiologists and academics say the hard-earned lessons from COVID have been drowned out by a growing distrust of science, expertise and authority.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;All of this leaves Texas less able and, likely, less willing to robustly respond to the next pandemic, at a time when measles and avian flu are spreading.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“A large group of people in the United States think that everyone in authority, not just the government, are stupid liars, and if you’re smart, you’ll do the exact opposite of what they tell you to,” said Dr. John Hellerstedt, who led the Texas Department of State Health Services during COVID. “This sets us up for catastrophic failure in the face of the next inevitable emergency.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left t-dropcap"&gt;Before COVID, most people were content to ignore public health, blissfully ignorant of the machine that quietly kept them and their community healthy by investigating disease outbreaks, inspecting restaurants, treating sexually transmitted diseases and vaccinating children. The fiscal conservatives at the Texas Legislature were too, typically allocating just enough funding to keep state and local public health authorities from collapsing.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In 2020, Texas spent about $20 per person on public health, 39th among the states and Washington, D.C. Local public health agencies operated with bare bones staffing, outdated technology and reduced services. The state agency that filled in the gaps was similarly strapped. Even with constant reminders that something larger was looming — the Ebola scare in 2014, the threat of Zika in 2015, periodic outbreaks of tuberculosis — there simply wasn’t the funding or the time to meaningfully prepare for a widespread crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


  
  

  





    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“You're struggling to do contact tracing on outbreaks of HIV. You’re struggling to reduce maternal mortality. You’re struggling to carry out the ordinary functions of public health,” Hellerstedt said. “It was impossible to think as a government agency you’d have the time or ability to truly model something like a global pandemic response.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In 2019, Hellerstedt came to the Texas Legislature with a prediction as ominous as it was prescient. The state’s “very, very outdated” disease tracking software was at risk of failure, he warned. Without an upgrade, it would “threaten the timeliness of public health’s infectious disease response,” the agency said in its budget request.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The Legislature appropriated $3.5 million to upgrade the technology. But it was too little, too late.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Before the agency had a chance to implement the changes, COVID hit, and decades of underfunding public health suddenly became a very expensive choice. There weren’t enough employees to do contact tracing. There weren’t clear protocols for acquiring and dispersing personal protective equipment, or setting up testing, or reporting results. And, as Hellerstedt predicted, the state’s disease tracking software quickly became overwhelmed at the moment it was needed most.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The state scrambled to build a new system on the fly, as local agencies relied on homespun trackers to monitor mounting case counts. In Cameron County, on the Texas-Mexico border, public health administrator Esmeralda Guajardo created an Excel spreadsheet and staff went in by hand to reconcile misspellings and double surnames.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We had to piecemeal a lot of stuff because we didn't have the resources,” she said. “But we wanted to make sure that we weren’t duplicating the case counts, because, of course, that affects the trust that people have with us.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/cite&gt;
      
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  


    
  
&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As Guajardo quickly realized, these case counts were more than just numbers. For a panicked and increasingly restive public, their rise and fall represented hope and devastation. For government officials, the numbers offered cover for difficult decisions: Gov. &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/directory/greg-abbott/"&gt;Greg Abbott&lt;/a&gt; justified his stay-at-home orders as based on “data and doctors.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Every time the state corrected the counts or suddenly released a backlogged deluge of positive test results, it introduced another crack in the public’s trust and willingness to comply with the rules. The longer the restrictions went on, the more that crack widened into a chasm.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“People wanted to know that if they complied, the result would get better. They didn’t want to think we didn’t have control over this,” said Mark Owens, a political science professor at The Citadel who ran the UT Tyler/Dallas Morning News poll at the time. “Everyone wanted it to go away, and when they complied and it didn’t, they got frustrated.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Public health agencies, once behind-the-scenes workhorses, became an outlet for the public’s growing anger over business closures, nursing home restrictions, and rapidly changing guidance. In Lubbock County, health director Katherine Wells’ received death threats, requiring police to guard her house.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We’d report the numbers and people would be so angry, saying, ‘Oh you’re just fear-mongering, you’re evil, you’re trying to pick a fight,” said former Milam County public health director Robert Kirkpatrick. “No, sir, I’m just doing my job.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As the death toll rose in hard-hit Cameron County, the distrust began to bleed into everything the public health agency did. Guajardo watched as longtime employees left for less intense, better paying jobs that didn’t have to interface with an angry public, and she couldn’t blame them.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We learned so much going through the pandemic, but then so much of that institutional knowledge walked out the door,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left t-dropcap"&gt;There was, initially, widespread support for mask-wearing, school closures and business shutdowns. But it didn’t take long for that moment of unity to crumble along partisan lines, as Texas’ elected officials joined the call to lift restrictions and reopen the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In Texas, things came to a head in May 2020, when Dallas salon owner Shelley Luther was jailed for reopening her business in violation of the state’s shutdown orders. Luther, who is now a state representative, framed the ongoing restrictions as a violation of her personal liberties. U.S. Sen. &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/directory/ted-cruz/"&gt;Ted Cruz&lt;/a&gt; and Lt. Gov. &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/directory/dan-patrick/"&gt;Dan Patrick&lt;/a&gt;, as well as President Donald Trump, rallied to her cause.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We have the constitutional right to be able to work to provide for our families, to pay our mortgages and I don’t feel it’s right to close us down for this long period of time,” Luther told &lt;a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/coronavirus/dallas-salon-set-to-re-open-despite-county-state-orders/2356298/?fbclid=IwAR3HbmK3tMRasihPY09SY2qrMkeHoPTqi4dF8WCEuG_sbz5Gk_HTEDXSePs"&gt;local news outlets at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Facing pressure from the right, Abbott quickly removed the enforcement mechanism from his orders and allowed some businesses to reopen sooner than expected. He later went even further, forbidding cities, counties and school districts from implementing their own mask mandates.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;A group of local leaders, incensed by what they saw as an undermining of their public health authority, sued, but the Texas Supreme Court sided with Abbott, saying he had the authority to tell local officials what to do — and what not to do — during a public health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Abbott did not respond to an interview request.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Many of these policies have since been enshrined in state law. Legislators have banned cities and counties from enacting mask mandates, closing businesses or schools, or requiring COVID vaccines, and prohibited the mandatory closure of churches and gun stores during an emergency declaration. While some of these laws apply only to COVID, public health experts say the playbook and political fault lines are in place to restrict the response to future disease outbreaks, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The Legislature also reined in the amount of time the state can remain under a public health disaster or emergency authorization. These declarations, intended to allow the state government to respond more nimbly to a crisis, can now only remain in effect for 30 days, after which the Legislature or a legislative committee would have to renew it monthly.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“It's just this weird, circular, extra, and I think, hindering level of bureaucracy that I am afraid is not going to be helpful for us in the next pandemic,” said Allison Winnike, a Houston-based lawyer with the Network for Public Health Law. “Our public health system will have its hands completely tied.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Some of the post-COVID legislation has been beneficial to public health, Winnike and other experts say. Legislators created a position for a state epidemiologist, strengthened data reporting requirements and funded the Texas Epidemic Public Health Institute, which helps state and local leaders anticipate and prepare for the next pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;But the state now spends less per capita on public health than it did before the pandemic, dropping down to fourth worst among states and D.C. Experts worry that the lasting distrust and disempowerment of public health will ripple through future disease outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I do understand that everything’s political, but public health is truly for everyone,” Winnike said. “It’s one of the basic things to have the conditions to live a healthy life and be protected from disease in your community. And I wish that was what we were bringing forward into the next pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left t-dropcap"&gt;For years, Dr. Peter Hotez watched in horror as more and more Texas families declined to get their children vaccinated, and wondered what, if anything, would reverse this trend.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Then came the pandemic. For a brief moment, Hotez thought this might be the turning point. And it was — just not in the way he’d hoped.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Unfortunately, it got politicized in a way that did the opposite, and has exacerbated anti-vaccine activism in the most horrific way imaginable,” said Hotez, a vaccine expert and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Like everything with COVID, the vaccine didn’t start out so political. “Operation Warp Speed,” the effort to quickly develop a COVID vaccine, launched under the first Trump administration. In &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/12/22/greg-abbott-texas-vaccine/"&gt;December 2020&lt;/a&gt;, Abbott proudly got the shot on camera, touting how “safe and easy” it was.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;But as the vaccine rolled out, and employer vaccine requirements with it, some began to chafe against what they saw as an infringement on their medical freedom. Conservatives began to coalesce around opposition to the vaccine, and by the end of 2021, Texas had sued the Biden administration at least four times over vaccine mandates for &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/11/16/texas-sues-biden-vaccine-mandate/"&gt;health care workers, federal contractors&lt;/a&gt;, l&lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/11/05/texas-ken-paxton-businesses-vaccines/"&gt;arge employers&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/01/04/texas-national-guard-vaccine-mandate/"&gt;National Guard&lt;/a&gt;. Texas also barred any state funds from being used to promote the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As vaccination rates began to diverge along partisan lines, COVID-related hospitalizations and deaths did, too. By fall 2021, death rates in counties that voted for Trump were four times as high as counties that voted for Biden, &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/03/03/the-changing-political-geography-of-covid-19-over-the-last-two-years/"&gt;Pew Research found&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;In Texas, this politicized resistance created what Hotez calls the “great COVID tragedy,” the death of more than 40,000 people after vaccines became widely available, 85% of them unvaccinated. These waves of casualties did little to change opinion — by &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/legislative/2022-Reports/Rider-33-Report-COVID-19-Immunization-Distribution-Texas.pdf"&gt;December 2022&lt;/a&gt;, the vast majority of unvaccinated Texans said they were not likely to get vaccinated in the next three months, and the largest percentage said nothing would make them more comfortable with the idea of getting the shot.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Hotez can understand why Texans were anxious about getting a newly developed vaccine, and resistant to mandates. But it didn’t stop there.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“In their zeal to push back against vaccine mandates, which you can kind of understand, they went to the next measure and falsely discredited the effectiveness and safety of vaccines,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Pushback to the COVID vaccine brought a deluge of new people into the anti-vaccine movement, moving this once-fringe political faction into the mainstream of the Republican party. After growing slowly for several years, the number of Texas families opting out of getting their children immunized spiked after 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


  
  

  





    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The consequences have been swift: Texas is currently experiencing its largest measles outbreak in 30 years, one of several vaccine-preventable conditions that’s on the rise as immunization rates drop.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“One of our hospitals has the highest number of COVID patients in the hospital right now than we’d had in probably a year,” Dr. Ron Cook, the Lubbock public health authority and a family physician, told The Texas Tribune in February. “We have the lowest uptake of flu [vaccines] and the highest flu levels. We have lower uptake of pertussis, and we have the highest level [of whooping cough] in nine years, which can be devastating, especially for little ones.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/coverage-by-season/2023-2024.html"&gt;39% of adult Texans&lt;/a&gt; got their flu shot in 2022-2023, the lowest rate since 2017. There was a slight improvement in 2023-2024, the latest data available, but Texas remains below the national average. The U.S. is experiencing its worst flu season since 2017.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Influenza can easily mutate into something much more dangerous than the seasonal flu, especially with H5N1, or avian flu, currently spreading among animals. If avian flu mutated in a way that was widely transmissible between humans — “That’s how pandemics arise,” said Catherine Troisi, an epidemiologist at UTHealth Houston School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“It’s really helpful in preventing the emergence of a totally new influenza virus we haven’t seen before if people are vaccinated against seasonal flu,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;This vaccine hesitancy doesn’t just increase the odds of another pandemic, Troisi said, but also how quickly we could stop it once it's here.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“Let’s say that H5N1 does become more transmissible from person to person. We probably could have a vaccine ready pretty quickly,” she said. “But would anybody take it? That’s the big question.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left t-dropcap"&gt;When Hellerstedt looks back on Texas’ handling of an unprecedented global pandemic, he sees successes. Hospitals stayed open, staffed and largely able to keep up with increased demand. The state helped get millions of vaccines into arms. There was good communication between local, state and federal partners.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The failure, he says, was communication with the public. As guidance changed, restrictions were lifted and reinstated, and a novel vaccine was rolled out, leaders at every level of government failed to bring the public along, explaining what they knew and how they knew it and, most importantly, what they didn’t know and what might change once they figured it out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Better communication wouldn’t have cut the number of deaths in half, he said. “But we would still have the confidence of the American people in the only institutions that have the authority and the capability and the capacity to shepherd them through an emergency,” he said. “And the loss of that is a very serious risk to our national security.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Hellerstedt thinks Texas, under Abbott, did better than most. Unlike Young in Milam County, Abbott survived reelection, despite challenges from the right and left, and has &lt;a href="https://texaspolitics.utexas.edu/set/greg-abbott-job-approval-trend"&gt;regained some of the popularity&lt;/a&gt; he lost during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;But the real test will be in Texas’ handling of the next public health crisis, which is already here.&lt;/p&gt;

          A sign, pictured on the left, reads, "STOP If you are ill and have the following: Fever, cough, red eyes, rash, runny nose OR known exposure to someone diagnosed with measles," outside of Covenant Children's Hospital in Lubbock on Feb. 26, 2025. The hospital added a green shed by the emergency entrance to screen for measles, pictured on the right.

&lt;/figure&gt;



    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Measles is spreading rapidly across West Texas, with well over 200 people infected over the course of 50 days and one young child dead. Based on Texas’ declining vaccination rates, the worst is yet to come, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;As leaders in West Texas scramble once more to stand up contact tracing, testing and vaccine sites, and quarantine plans, they find themselves &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/10/rural-texas-measles-outbreak-response/"&gt;still without the resources&lt;/a&gt; they need to address a disease outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;The state and federal government have stepped in to help, but top leaders, including Abbott, have hardly addressed the outbreak in public, let alone encouraged vaccination. Conservative Fort Worth Rep. &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/directory/nate-schatzline/"&gt;Nate Schatzline&lt;/a&gt; posted &lt;a href="https://x.com/NateSchatzline/status/1897783600499593727?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet"&gt;a video on X&lt;/a&gt; lauding the low vaccination rates at his children’s school, celebrating that they “honor the wishes of moms and dads over any type of health official.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;This leaves local health officials to battle both measles and the lasting distrust of a pandemic-weary public. There’s been some increased uptake at vaccine clinics since the death was reported, Cook, in Lubbock, said, but there’s also been rampant misinformation, public resistance and even the threat of mass infection events like measles parties.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      


    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“We have plenty of vaccines, we’re figuring out the logistics, but if we can’t get people to take it, this is just going to get worse,” he said. “People forget how bad this can be … We still have COVID deaths. We still have flu deaths. And now, measles deaths.”&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;Unlike COVID, there’s a safe, effective measles vaccine already on the market, which will prevent this from becoming a pandemic. But, public health experts say, there will be a next pandemic at some point, possibly sooner than we realize. And no matter the crisis, be it a regional outbreak or a global pandemic, Texas will need the trust and cooperation of the public to manage it.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;It’s clear from this outbreak, public health experts and front-line responders say, that trust has been tested and, in too many cases, has disappeared entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

    
      &lt;p class="t-copy t-links-underlined t-align-left"&gt;“I’m afraid if we have another pandemic, it would be worse,” Guajardo said. “Not because of the pandemic itself, but because of people choosing to believe what they want.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It has long been recognised that attitudes towards vaccines may be &lt;a href="https://www.asset-scienceinsociety.eu/sites/default/files/sage_working_group_revised_report_vaccine_hesitancy.pdf"&gt;vaccine-specific&lt;/a&gt;, so that people may take up some, but not others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 26 2021, the following statement was posted on Twitter (later renamed X) about the COVID-19 vaccine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not even a real vaccine. You can catch Covid and also spread it if you are vaccinated. You don’t catch polio or MMR after you are vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590136225000142"&gt;My colleagues and I&lt;/a&gt; came across this comment and many like it while analysing a nine-million-word dataset consisting of tweets about the COVID and MMR vaccines posted between 2008 and 2022, to learn more about vaccine scepticism. We discovered that the author of this tweet is not alone in questioning the status of the COVID-19 vaccines as vaccines, and comparing it to others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Vaccines (but not as you know them)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590136225000142"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; also investigated how, in the years of the pandemic, people compared the COVID-19 vaccines unfavourably with the MMR vaccine. Many described a perception that the COVID vaccines were not very effective at preventing infection:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes because the covid vaccine is just like the MMR vaccine. NOT. MMR vaccine provides 99.8% protection from catching measles, mumps or rubella. Covid vaccine does NOT stop you from catching covid. Vaccinate away but it’s not going to stop covid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people go one step further and state that, therefore, the COVID-19 vaccines are not vaccines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How about we start with the fact that it’s not a vaccine, it’s a therapeutic. True vaccines immunize you from the virus. The COVID “vaccine” still allows you to catch COVID just with lesser symptoms. Not the same with polio, MMR, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some tweets, posters use the term “shot” in contrast with “vaccine”, to suggest an inferior intervention, despite the fact they mean the same thing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop calling it a vaccine. It’s a shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 20 years ago a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37750434/"&gt;discredited but still influential claim&lt;/a&gt; that the MMR vaccine may cause autism caused a wave of vaccine scepticism. But this is a new type of vaccine-specific scepticism. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our data, there is almost no evidence before 2020 of people claiming that some vaccines are not in fact vaccines. In the period 2020-2022, this form of scepticism increased rapidly in relation to the COVID-19 vaccines, and also applied to the flu vaccine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you tell me more about this “vaccine” for the flu that allows tens of thousands of deaths? That’s not a vaccine, it’s a flu shot. Much different than say a polio vaccine or MMR vaccine. I would argue that we do NOT have a flu vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How can we explain this?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experts were already aware that some diseases, such as measles, are vaccine-preventable: if you are vaccinated, you are extremely unlikely to be infected. In contrast, other diseases, including influenza and COVID-19, are vaccine-modifiable: if you are vaccinated, you may still be infected, but you are much less likely to become seriously ill or die. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to do with the quality of the vaccines, never mind their status as vaccines, but with differences between, for example, more stable viruses and viruses that mutate over time, and between different rates at which immunity wanes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, definitions of vaccination by, for example, the &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/vaccines-and-immunization-what-is-vaccination"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; and the UK’s &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/vaccinations/why-vaccination-is-important-and-the-safest-way-to-protect-yourself/"&gt;National Health Service&lt;/a&gt;, tend to focus on the prevention of disease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until the pandemic, these definitions were mostly consistent with people’s experiences of vaccination. Even with flu, there was no easy access to tests that could show that you had been infected with the strain you had been vaccinated against.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic changed all that. It became a common experience to test positive for COVID-19 even after receiving one or more vaccine doses. Our research found that for some people, this did not undermine confidence in the status of the COVID-19 vaccines as vaccines. For others it did. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This probably explains the new type of scepticism my colleagues and I discovered. It is a scepticism that may be shared by people who normally take up vaccines, for themselves and for their children. The use of informal alternatives to the term “vaccine”, such as “shot”, in public health messaging may unintentionally contribute to this confusion about what counts as a vaccine.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If left unaddressed, this new scepticism may affect the take up of seasonal flu and COVID-19 vaccines, as well as confidence in vaccines in future pandemics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

Is that true?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@emo_swiftie_13/video/7392991825021177134" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;a video on TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, a woman waves a plastic water bottle containing chia seeds, lemon juice and water in front of the camera. She’s on her fourth day of drinking the gloop, she says. “Let me tell you something,” she adds, “this is, like, the realest thing I’ve ever learned on the internet. I am the most constipated person I know,” but since drinking the chia seeds, she continues, she has “never been so regular.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It’s a familiar line on TikTok, where views for many videos about “&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=internal%20shower&amp;amp;t=1741126636846" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;the internal shower&lt;/a&gt;,” as the drink has been called, number in the millions. Chia seed water is made from simple ingredients: just a tablespoon or two of chia seeds, water and perhaps &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@reeganpawlicki/video/7395252307555929386" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;a squeeze of lemon juice for taste&lt;/a&gt;. Yet the drink &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@rachellldaguanno/video/7413433122156514566" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;has been said&lt;/a&gt; to have big benefits, including helping with bloating, bowel irregularity and even weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;To a certain extent, these claims are true, said Amanda Lynett, a dietitian specializing in gastroenterology and hepatology at Michigan Medicine. Thanks to the high fiber content, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/26/well/eat/chia-seeds-benefits.html" title=""&gt;chia seeds&lt;/a&gt; are one of her go-to dietary recommendations for people who struggle with constipation, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But you don’t have to chug them in water to enjoy their benefits. Experts say that no matter how you consume chia seeds — whether sprinkled onto oatmeal or yogurt, or mixed into puddings, baked goods or smoothies — they’ll still help your digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-9b09b8c"&gt;What does the research suggest?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;When asked if any studies had examined whether chia seeds could reduce constipation, the experts said they weren’t aware of any.

Now, one mom is detailing her daughter’s hospitalization just minutes after consuming the popular drink to send a warning to other parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Kim Moore — from Lancashire, England — took her daughters Marnie, 4, and Orla, 6, to a children’s party, where she bought them refillable slushies. After 10 minutes, her youngest daughter fell unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 35-year-old told Kennedy News and Media via the &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14506497/toddler-unresponsive-glycerol-toxicity-slushy-drink-danger.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Daily Mail;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that Marnie was “pale and unresponsive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We ended up buying two one-litre refillable cups and they were going off playing, eating, getting drinks and coming back but Marnie didn't drink the full cup, probably only half,” she recalled. "Then about 10 minutes later, she started getting really aggravated then she started falling asleep so I just thought she was over-tired.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was only five minutes later when I tried to wake her up that I realised she wasn't waking up and was actually unconscious,” she told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy News and Media&lt;/p&gt; KIM MOORE, 35, WITH HER TWO DAUGHTERS MARNIE MOORE AND ORLA MOORE&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore tried to shake the toddler awake but with no luck, rushed her to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think it was mum's instinct that I knew something wasn't right,” she told the outlet. “She was floppy and completely unconscious.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After arriving at the hospital, doctors discovered that Marnie’s blood sugar levels were dangerously low, and transferred her to another hospital, where she remained for three days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had no clue what had caused it. She was unconscious for around 25 minutes while they brought her blood sugars up,” Moore said. "In hospital, she screamed out in agony saying her head hurt and threw up everywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore was later told that her 4-year-old was suffering from glycerol toxicity as a result of consuming the slush ice drink, which contained the sweetener glycerol. Many slushies contain glycerol because it gives the drink its “slushy” texture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of glycerol toxicity include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, confusion, decreased consciousness, low blood sugar levels and low levels of potassium in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people.com/at-least-21-children-hospitalized-after-drinking-slushies-with-glycerol-11695313" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:At Least 21 Children Hospitalized After Drinking Slushies with Common — and Legal — Ingredient, Study Finds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;At Least 21 Children Hospitalized After Drinking Slushies with Common — and Legal — Ingredient, Study Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy News and Media&lt;/p&gt; Marnie Moore in the hospital at age 4&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Looking back, she had every single symptom of glycerol toxicity,” Moore admitted. "I was in absolute fear. If I hadn't taken her to hospital, it may have had a different outcome.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moore said her daughter was able to recover after three days in the hospital. She is now sending a warning to other parents, urging them to not allow their young children to consume the slush ice drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So many places promote free slushies when you play there but you're promoting poison,” she told the outlet. “I don't think these slushies should be allowed at all. I personally wouldn't allow my child to drink one at all. It's not a risk I'm willing to take.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think they should be sold to kids 12 and under in all honesty,” she said. “I wouldn't wish what we went through on our worst enemy. It was awful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-puzzler-8620185" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here!

According to the study, 93% of the children became unwell “within 60 minutes” of drinking the slush ice drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the results, the ADC has urged children under age 8 to avoid drinking ice drinks containing glycerol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Consumption of slush ice drinks containing glycerol may cause a clinical syndrome of glycerol intoxication in young children,” they wrote. “This mimics inherited disorders of gluconeogenesis and glycerol metabolism. Clinicians and parents should be alert to the phenomenon, and public health bodies should ensure clear messaging regarding [this].”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the &lt;a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/safety-hygiene/food-additives#glycerol" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Food Standards Agency;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Food Standards Agency&lt;/a&gt; recommends that children aged 4 years and under should “not consume” slush ice drinks containing glycerol “due to their potential to cause side-effects such as headaches and sickness, particularly when consumed in excess.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glycerol is “generally thought to be safe in humans,” and it is an authorized group I food additive in the EU, under Annex II and Annex III of Regulation (EC) number 1333/2008, per the ADC. However, the organization added that “there is poor transparency around glycerol concentration,” possibly leading to children being hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/4-year-old-completely-unconscious-after-drinking-toxic-slushy-11698511" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxON0dldVZrd3JqX1lPblk4S21maHcwRzk1OHNZei1BVzhzeFotTXNVOTktZy1CdHdabXRQYXExeGRScWNxMTkyUlRPaUZrS0toX3VZVndWMlVLUWdsM1U4V1g4SmRuaWpibTFFNlgzb2owRDhmX0lHUFR6ZnYxeVVaaXhR</guid></item><item><title>Six surprising health benefits of regular walking for seniors - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQelFzU1FUaTVXQnZLOW5zTGw0VmQ2cm1QSkZJaXp5c3ByWWJISWVRRExlUkk1VXlBWlVaV3lyd0RtWVZMVFR2VnhnZEJPX2haaG5MUUdXdm5qcWJ4V2xOZkNpRm8xX0ZVSnM0NF9JYmUtbnZCMVhaR1dCZTVxaTl5MTZlWUZLWkJmS2JpdU5fTlVyQ2M3Y3FsQ1Y5NzFMOXZuSzAyUENnOGdFdGxLQVhuOGJPT29LSFJY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 lkPksW sc-jbiisr-1 hiukpJ" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 cFynzd" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 eFDpwi"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 jkkqcL"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 dDFcwe"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 kqOtlp"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 bjQKsM"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 hWxisF sc-hez36s-16 gBaKpR"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 ifXxYf"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 jlvSeZ"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 ghJHgZ"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 bhFQeV"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 gMxIQB"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

Helps strengthen bone and joint health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As we get older, some of us are at more risk of osteoporosis, a condition which makes bones weak and more likely to break,” says Dr Nasrin Razzaq, a GP with an extended role in geriatric medicine at Mollison Way Surgery, part of GP Pathfinder Clinics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-none"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 ibpbRH"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/03/17/14/17112713-cdd19ef0-096b-43bb-b7dd-61887f552db6.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/03/17/14/17112713-cdd19ef0-096b-43bb-b7dd-61887f552db6.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/03/17/14/17112713-cdd19ef0-096b-43bb-b7dd-61887f552db6.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Experts say regular walking can reduce the natural decline in bone health" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-24875"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Experts say regular walking can reduce the natural decline in bone health&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Alamy/PA)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Walking helps by strengthening bones as it’s a weight-bearing exercise, meaning your bones support your weight, which encourages bone growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Regular walking also reduces the natural decline in bone strength.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Helps prevent falls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Stronger bones mean a lower chance of fractures following a fall, especially in the hips, spine and wrist,” highlights Razzaq. “Walking improves movement and balance by keeping joints flexible and improving balance and coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Walking helps prevent stiffness, making movement easier and strengthens the muscles that keep you steady.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 epFywa"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Boosts mood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Walking releases endorphins and serotonin in your brain which are natural mood-lifters that reduce anxiety and depression,” says Betts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 kWYnHL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 lafNeh sc-482ou5-3 fdIcNP image align-none"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 lkeWpK"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 rSfrR"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/03/17/14/17122931-58b325b5-9f71-4a16-bff3-c3bfd46a7b47.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/03/17/14/17122931-58b325b5-9f71-4a16-bff3-c3bfd46a7b47.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/03/17/14/17122931-58b325b5-9f71-4a16-bff3-c3bfd46a7b47.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Spending time outdoors in great for the mind" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 bNNNXy inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cFynzd dcZiNS" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-ohzviw-0 klhTsW inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-24876"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-ohzviw-1 bDzDal"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 fWLHSZ hfwDDP"&gt;Spending time outdoors in great for the mind&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 eUTWtv"&gt; (Alamy/PA)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many older adults experience greater mental clarity during and after walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The sense of accomplishment from maintaining a walking routine boosts your self esteem and confidence, particularly important as you age and may face other physical limitations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 08:18:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQelFzU1FUaTVXQnZLOW5zTGw0VmQ2cm1QSkZJaXp5c3ByWWJISWVRRExlUkk1VXlBWlVaV3lyd0RtWVZMVFR2VnhnZEJPX2haaG5MUUdXdm5qcWJ4V2xOZkNpRm8xX0ZVSnM0NF9JYmUtbnZCMVhaR1dCZTVxaTl5MTZlWUZLWkJmS2JpdU5fTlVyQ2M3Y3FsQ1Y5NzFMOXZuSzAyUENnOGdFdGxLQVhuOGJPT29LSFJY</guid></item><item><title>10-Year-Old Girl Dies After Flu Complications Left Her ‘Screaming’ and Unable to ‘Feel Her Legs and Feet’ - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5yaEQ1ZmNveDFMSXhJcTlYT2E3S2JWT05NNGJjQ1FrSGxPbWJoaWlQOHlSNkl1Qjh3c2g5VUtEYV8yaHVsMU44cm5nb2FfMDRBLWJZbTlJeDZTb0NUWktTdkJ0TER5UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/p&gt; Minka Greene White&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Maryland family is mourning after a 10-year-old girl died from complications of the &lt;a href="https://people.com/health/everything-to-know-about-the-flu-from-prevention-to-treatment/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:flu;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;flu&lt;/a&gt;, just days after being dismissed from the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minka Aisha Greene, a healthy and active elementary school student, was considered the “light” of her family. So, when the 10-year-old started having low energy and a lack of appetite in late January, her mother Kymesha Greene White was immediately concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We noticed her behavior changed because she normally doesn’t get sick. This was like her first time getting sick,” Kymesha &lt;a href="https://www.dcnewsnow.com/news/local-news/maryland/prince-georges-county/family-remembers-10-year-old-who-died-from-flu-in-prince-georges-county/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:told;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; DC News Now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kymesha took her little girl to the emergency room and Minka was diagnosed with the flu and a UTI. She was given ibuprofen and sent home to rest. However, Minka started complaining about headaches so her mother took her back to the ER. During the second visit, she was given fluids and sent home again to rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minka’s health ultimately took a turn for the worse on the morning of Feb. 6, when Kymesha found her daughter vomiting in bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I heard her screaming, ‘Mommy!’ And I’m like, ‘What’s wrong?’ That’s when she said she couldn’t feel her legs and her feet,” she recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://people.com/9-year-old-dies-flu-b-buffalo-11685217" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Girl, 9, Dies from Complications from the Flu: 'She Was Too Perfect for This World';elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Girl, 9, Dies from Complications from the Flu: 'She Was Too Perfect for This World'&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kymesha and her husband David White rushed their daughter, who had not had the flu vaccine, to the hospital. She &lt;a href="https://dailyvoice.com/md/capitol-heights-district-heights/minka-greene-dies-of-from-flu-related-symptoms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:told;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Capitol Heights Daily Voice that on the way there, one of her daughter’s eyes rolled to the back of her head and her tongue started moving uncontrollably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after arriving at the hospital, Minka stopped breathing. Doctors performed CPR and other life-saving procedures but the parents were later told that their daughter had no brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was the last time I carried her, the last time I held her in my arms. I will cherish that for the rest of my life,” said David.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minka later died on Feb. 10 at the hospital. “We had to let our baby go,” said Kymesha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following Minka’s death, the family learned that she suffered severe brain inflammation caused by the flu. They are now sharing their story in hopes of warning other parents. “Advocate for your babies,” Kymesha said. “When they say they’re hurting, tell the doctors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two types of influenza viruses: &lt;a href="https://people.com/5-year-old-diagnosed-with-influenza-a-temporarily-loses-ability-to-walk-exclusive-11681082" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Flu A;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Flu A&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://people.com/health/ohio-teen-dies-from-the-flu-days-after-christmas/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Flu B;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Flu B&lt;/a&gt;, according to  &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/flu-b-symptoms-identify-treat-and-prevent-5216276" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Verywell Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verywell Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They both cause similar symptoms, like fever, body aches, and coughing. While Flu A is more common and thought to be more dangerous — the outlet reports that it accounted for 97% of cases during the 2022-2023 season — Flu B “symptoms can range from mild to severe.” Additionally, the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9835412/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institute of Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institute of Health&lt;/a&gt; reports that “neurological complications occurred in one-fifth of hospitalized children due to influenza.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/children.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:U.S. Centers for Disease Control;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;U.S. Centers for Disease Control &lt;/a&gt;says, “Flu can be more dangerous than the common cold for children” and recommends preventative measures — such as vaccination and frequent hand washing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/girl-10-dies-from-flu-brain-swelling-11698306" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 07:32:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5yaEQ1ZmNveDFMSXhJcTlYT2E3S2JWT05NNGJjQ1FrSGxPbWJoaWlQOHlSNkl1Qjh3c2g5VUtEYV8yaHVsMU44cm5nb2FfMDRBLWJZbTlJeDZTb0NUWktTdkJ0TER5UQ</guid></item><item><title>The U.S. measles outbreak is growing.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Measles cases are on the rise in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Pan American Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/30/718220586/is-measles-here-to-stay"&gt;declared the disease eliminated in 2000&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to widespread vaccination efforts by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But it's still an issue globally, which means an unvaccinated person could catch the highly infectious disease abroad and bring it back to the United States. And &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/09/02/1198913177/measles-cases-are-up-and-childhood-vaccinations-are-down"&gt;declining vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in young children, are causing public health officials to worry about the impact of emerging outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's the case in West Texas and New Mexico, where &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309800/texas-measles-child-death-vaccination"&gt;a growing measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; now numbers &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025"&gt;around 300 confirmed cases&lt;/a&gt; — more than the total number of measles cases reported in the U.S. in all of 2024. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Right now, NPR health correspondent &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/people/348777820/maria-godoy"&gt;Maria Godoy&lt;/a&gt; says that the Texas outbreak is still limited to remote rural areas where vaccination rates are low. But measles is highly contagious – &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312088/measles-texas-outbreak-contagious-spread"&gt;more infectious than COVID-19, smallpox, or even Ebola&lt;/a&gt;. So, if an infected person travels to another community with low vaccination rates, that person could potentially sow another outbreak upon returning.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interested in other stories about public health?

Forget trying to empty your mind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your mind will feel very busy when you first start meditating, but that's completely normal. Try observing your thoughts without being drawn into them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just let your thoughts come and go and simply practice being still for a little while," says Rowell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Don’t give up!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Meditation isn't a quick fix," Rowell explains. "But I guarantee if you stick with it for a few weeks you will feel the impact."&lt;/p&gt;

But during the pregnancy she developed gestational diabetes, so her doctor decided she and her baby would benefit from specialized nutrition counseling and access to food that’s good specifically to counter diabetes. The doctor sent her with a prescription to the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Oswald “Oz” Hutton, 60, of Salt Lake City, has battled hypertension, arthritis and chronic pain. What you eat makes a difference there, too, so the U.S. Marine Corps veteran opted into nutritional education and access to high quality produce courtesy of a program that’s a partnership between the Rockefeller Foundation and the Veterans Health Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Those two programs — and scores of others — are part of the “Food Is Medicine” movement, the belief that what people eat helps determine their health on many levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="5016" data-height="3481"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/BU5AWZNWWVDQZCS4KSW6HH5FY4.JPG?auth=14c80e07d1cc51b2758d0b47026bbdeab210a21a3158f5fc0be3a35302cc36a5&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=555" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/BU5AWZNWWVDQZCS4KSW6HH5FY4.JPG?auth=14c80e07d1cc51b2758d0b47026bbdeab210a21a3158f5fc0be3a35302cc36a5&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1110 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Ellen Maxfield, University of Utah Health clinical operations associate director, grabs food for a patient at the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy trailer parked outside of Greenwood Health Center in Midvale on Friday, March 14, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Kristin Murphy, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“If you think about the drivers of health, dietary risk factors are shown to be the most important modifiable risk factor for chronic disease and death. Yet in health care, we don’t really talk about that much,” said Dr. Amy Locke, whose many titles include chief wellness officer at University of Utah Health, professor and co-director of the Driving Out Diabetes Initiative at the Osher Center for Integrative Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Locke said modifiable health risk factors are about 20% clinical, 30% behaviors like getting enough sleep or eating well, roughly 10% physical environment and 40% socioeconomic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“If you have good health care and you have good socioeconomic status, it’s easier to eat a healthy diet,” she told Deseret News. “What we want to do is use the health care space to leverage those other buckets as much as possible, so we are doing a bunch of ‘Food Is Medicine’-related things.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The federal government, health care providers, nonprofits, academics and others are embracing the concept that you can be healthier or sicker depending on what you eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3000" data-height="2110"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/5RS4DJ7COBCGLCLHRWTWMRSCMA.JPG?auth=85d68d6940628225a1ad5a6740c34463f4f409599611ab039693511b4922f2de&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=562" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/5RS4DJ7COBCGLCLHRWTWMRSCMA.JPG?auth=85d68d6940628225a1ad5a6740c34463f4f409599611ab039693511b4922f2de&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1124 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Sarah Zou, clinical dietician, gives two bags of food to Alma Rivera, who is eight months pregnant and has gestational diabetes, from the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy trailer parked outside of Greenwood Health Center in Midvale on Friday, March 14, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Kristin Murphy, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The 2022 White House Conference on Hunger, Nutrition and Health firmly tied together food and health in its call to end hunger and reduce chronic disease by 2030, as the &lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/our-work/nutrition-physical-activity/food-medicine" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports. The office said 60% of U.S. adults have some diet-related chronic disease that the right food — and avoiding the wrong ones — can impact. At the same time, there are 18 million people whose households experience food insecurity. The result is an estimated $4 trillion in health care spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Deseret News looked at two of the dozens of examples of “Food Is Medicine” programs. How programs operate and who they target varies. But many of them — including the University of Utah Food Pharmacy and the pilot project funded by the Rockefeller Foundation involving Salt Lake area veterans who receive services at the VA — share certain traits: The beneficiaries like Hutton and Rivera have medical conditions that food impacts. Participants are considered food insecure and meet income qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The programs also both have strong education components to help those benefiting understand why food matters, how to make good food choices and even how easy it is to make good meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;They also both provide actual food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="4499" data-height="3027"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/V4WTC35XARAORNK5C7RRB3TZNI.JPG?auth=1cead1e7257279a72b5868b9d588e221a99151fa449e0ca062f78fdc5ab214df&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=538" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/V4WTC35XARAORNK5C7RRB3TZNI.JPG?auth=1cead1e7257279a72b5868b9d588e221a99151fa449e0ca062f78fdc5ab214df&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1076 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Food is pictured in the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy trailer parked outside of Greenwood Health Center in Midvale on Friday, March 14, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Kristin Murphy, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="Helping-veterans-get-healthy" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Helping veterans get healthy&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Veterans Health Administration hosted a bipartisan Congressional event last week to tout its partnership with the foundation, which just made a $100 million commitment to Food Is Medicine programs, building on its prescription pilot projects in Utah and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Projects are being launched in Maryland and New York, with partners including the VA, Instacart, Syracuse University, University of Utah, 4P Foods, as well as in North Carolina, Duke University and Reinvestment Partners. The programs have different designs to meet needs in the areas they serve. But the classes, resources and prescriptions are tailored specifically to patients and their chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Hutton is one of 275 veterans in the Utah pilot; the programs combined hope to help 2,000 veterans, while gathering research and looking for ways to tackle diet-related diseases like diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure among U.S. veterans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Along with food education, veterans in the program are given gift cards worth $100 a month that can be used to buy fruits and vegetables at participating stores. The program lasts 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Retired four-star U.S. Navy Admiral James Stavridis, foundation board chair, said access to healthy food improves mental and physical health while lowering the cost of health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="5030" data-height="3400"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/IAQQU3EYC5FWPCGFBDZANH4DQ4.JPG?auth=1f22fb218a44f6c37caa187532f291ae6d7048de899758230f2b9e5b681aa63f&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=540" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/IAQQU3EYC5FWPCGFBDZANH4DQ4.JPG?auth=1f22fb218a44f6c37caa187532f291ae6d7048de899758230f2b9e5b681aa63f&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1080 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Sarah Zou, clinical dietician, helps a patient choose groceries at the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy trailer parked outside of Greenwood Health Center in Midvale on Friday, March 14, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Kristin Murphy, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3695271/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has reported that three-quarters of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan were overweight or obese when they first went to a VA clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Noah Cohen-Cline, director of the Rockefeller Foundation initiative, said the program uses Food Is Medicine initiatives like produce prescriptions, meals tailored to medical needs and groceries that can be prescribed by a clinician as part of medical treatment, “with the big-picture goal of seeing these interventions formally integrated into health care as a covered medical benefit.” These pilot projects are testing programs and measuring outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The foundation would love to expand it to all eligible veterans, including 116,000 in Utah, but Cohen-Cline said philanthropies alone can’t meet the need; that requires funding from other sources, including health care systems and insurance companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He said it saves money and improves quality of life, making it a great investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="5181" data-height="3454"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/AM6QSUTRDZGLVBTJM33KXZX44Q.JPG?auth=9d3c9dee36b93b125bbe0394aa91f4a0c7756f7679000477dfc4f8e35b4a802d&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/AM6QSUTRDZGLVBTJM33KXZX44Q.JPG?auth=9d3c9dee36b93b125bbe0394aa91f4a0c7756f7679000477dfc4f8e35b4a802d&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Ellen Maxfield, University of Utah Health clinical operations associate director, and Sarah Zou, clinical dietician, help a patient choose food from the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy trailer parked outside of Greenwood Health Center in Midvale on Friday, March 14, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Kristin Murphy, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="What-is-a-food-pharmacy" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;What is a food pharmacy?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The University of Utah Health System, through its integrative medicine department, teaches students in health-related fields how to talk about food as a wellness tool and also how to eat a healthy diet themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Food is the most significant modifiable risk factor. You should not show up at a medical facility and not have the opportunity to talk about food,” Locke said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In the food lab, future health providers learn that good food needn’t be expensive and can be delicious, said Locke. “We have a whole college of health on this campus, which is amazing. We’ve got a dietetics program that’s been teaching people to cook since 1940, so they have a lot of practice. So getting these other health profession students, nurses, physicians, pharmacists in that lab experiencing food in a fun and healthy way is really important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Locke said discussion of food as medicine empowers people to be healthier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The Food Pharmacy program itself is for those in the University of Utah health care medical network who are food insecure and have a food-changeable chronic condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“What’s really cool about the food pharmacy program is that it not only helps people understand what a healthy diet is, but it provides some actual food,” Locke said, adding she was well into her career when she realized knowing about healthy food is great, but you also have to be able to obtain it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The coaching piece paired with food and resources, ”that’s where the magic of the food pharmacy program really is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The food pharmacy is “embedded in a clinical space.” A care provider refers patients for nutrition education and provides a prescription for foods that will help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;That sends the patient into the program for education, followed by up to six visits to the food pharmacy truck, which alternates between the Greenwood Clinic in Midvale and the Redwood Clinic in Salt Lake City. The truck operates on a limited basis twice a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="5407" data-height="3529"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/6EA6IQMP7JCZJCX76WVFEVPE3U.JPG?auth=efeb474c5d7f723c0d96cd5bc217a0a0621816b2419d2606f973076a3759c783&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=522" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/6EA6IQMP7JCZJCX76WVFEVPE3U.JPG?auth=efeb474c5d7f723c0d96cd5bc217a0a0621816b2419d2606f973076a3759c783&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1044 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Alma Rivera, who is eight months pregnant and has gestational diabetes, visits the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy trailer for the first time outside of Greenwood Health Center in Midvale on Friday, March 14, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Kristin Murphy, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="Resources-education-coaching" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Resources, education, coaching&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Ellen Maxfield, associate director of clinical operations for the integrative health center and director of the University of Utah’s diabetes prevention program, said they don’t try to meet all of a person’s food needs, but rather coach and supplement. Unlike the VA program, it’s not just produce. At the truck, for instance, Rivera chose two dairy items (they had 2% milk, almond milk and yogurt that day), three veggies from a selection of fresh and canned, two proteins (offerings were pinto beans, tuna and peanut butter), two fruits (fresh and canned) and two starches (brown rice, spaghetti, oatmeal and bread).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Food pharmacy patients are given information packets in English and Spanish on resources to community food banks and other programs like farmer’s markets that also help with food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Food resources, education and coaching,” said Maxfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The food pharmacy itself looks like a food truck with lots of refrigerator space and room for Sarah Zou, the pharmacy’s registered dietitian, and health-field students who help fill orders. They’re trained to think about and talk about food as medicine, plus they get experience working with patients. Thanks to translation services, they can help people speaking a wide variety of languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;On the way from a Food Is Medicine appointment, patients can visit the truck and pick their food. Rivera opted for a variety of fresh and shelf stable items; Maxfield said they learn to use both well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Follow-up visits can be done in person or by telehealth to reduce the transportation and scheduling burden. Those following up remotely use a gift card that’s specific to the program to choose certain foods. Kroger provided the cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The program is still small, Maxfield and Locke said, but has served nearly 400 people. They’re learning what works and its impact. But they believe treating food as medicine and helping people understand how what you eat impacts health will have lifelong — and quality of life — effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Said Locke, “This is a piece of a much bigger sort of initiative of, how do we help improve health, and specifically nutrition of people in Salt Lake and in Utah, from school-based programs to teaching kitchens?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="4952" data-height="3076"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/HGMDLKUPARGUFJGU52KKJ623FA.JPG?auth=079c34865a6842385cea23df280666ce60646907232d27221a89137faefb25f8&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=496" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/HGMDLKUPARGUFJGU52KKJ623FA.JPG?auth=079c34865a6842385cea23df280666ce60646907232d27221a89137faefb25f8&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=992 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Food is pictured in the University of Utah Health Food Pharmacy trailer parked outside of Greenwood Health Center in Midvale on Friday, March 14, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Kristin Murphy, Deseret News &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="Food-to-share" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Food to share&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The food pharmacy project is housed in the Osher Center for Integrative Health and the Driving Out Diabetes initiative. Patients can get food six times on a doctor’s referral and can repeat if they want, Maxfield said, for a year total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Part of what makes both programs successful is buy-in by local grocers. In Utah, for instance, several grocery stores — including Kroger (Smith’s in Utah) and Lucky have teamed up with the foundation to accept the cards to pay for produce. Maxfield said the university health program is all collaboration, from the student piece to the funding piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The food comes from University Hospital’s Nutrition Care Services, the Utah Food Bank, and Dairy West provides dairy resources and helps fund the truck. Others contribute, too. The program also buys farm shares during the growing season from the International Rescue Committee’s New Roots program. Kroger provides grocery gift cards. And the Driving Out Diabetes Initiative supports the program, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Without all that collaboration, neither program could operate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Eating-your-way-to-better-health" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Eating your way to better health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Hutton, who recently graduated from the program, said he’s not only learned what to eat, but what not to eat to maintain healthy blood pressure numbers. “Part of my goal is to eat my way to better health,” he said, noting he not only has had high blood pressure, but arthritis and chronic pain that can be helped by food choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He was already a cook. But he said looking at food as medicine is different. And the cooking class was amazing, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“But classes only take you so far if you can’t afford to buy the produce you want,” the foundation’s Cohen-Cline said. It is in pairing access with knowledge that there’s “a lot of power.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“By eating better, I have energy,” said Hutton, who admits he has a tendency to self isolate. “Now, when I go outdoors, I want to stay outside and do things, to socialize. So one of the least talked about benefits is positive mental health and overall well-being.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;It was Rivera’s first Food Pharmacy appointment, so it’s too soon to say how it will help her. But the goal is clear: A healthy baby and a lifetime of food-related health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Tue, 18 Mar 2025 03:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNZnI1eERhckl1NjQ2QjdwTGdmeGJVV25lWnFueDRicjdRX2NyTXAzVnpnbGhaVWtJbFNBenVxYVU4Q0UwUTg2eGJPZWRtQlVnczA5TEE5OG5USHNreWdOS3o4cnNkckJDVVVCLUpvRF9xRUQ0Vy1EcXRpVkIzdVIzeFZiUEpTN1RjQlhqX2JnTkhDdmo2MlotdjVmVzI3NFRXWEF5RzUyVDVjd3k4WHJoR3U4cw</guid></item><item><title>3 cases of chickenpox confirmed at Colorado Springs elementary school - Colorado Springs Gazette</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" itemprop="articleBody" class="asset-content  subscriber-premium" false&gt;

                                &lt;p&gt;At least three students are confirmed to have chickenpox after an outbreak at The Classical Academy's central campus, according to KOAA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson said that the students are in first, second and fourth grade, with the first case confirmed on Friday. The campus has about 600 students, ranging from kindergarten through sixth grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an email sent to parents of central campus Monday, the academy said that students with chickenpox need to stay home from school until their rash has scabbed or dried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"TCA takes safety and health of students very seriously. We made the call with the health department as soon as we found out," said TCA spokesperson Tisha Harris, via KOAA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;School officials said they are working with the El Paso County Public Health Department for safety guidance. The department considers an outbreak at three or more cases, KOAA said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, chickenpox is very contagious, and usually lasts from four to seven days. Up to 90 percent of people who are not immune and who are in close contact with an infected person will also get infected.Â &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chickenpox symptoms can be eased by taking a bath and using lotion and baking soda, the CDC says. Additionally, those infected should try their best not to scratch their hives, as doing so could further spread the virus or cause skin infections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Giving blood regularly may not just be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/australian-man-whose-blood-donations-saved-millions-dies-age-88"&gt;saving the lives&lt;/a&gt; of other people, it could also be improving your own blood's health at a genetic level, according to a new study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international team of researchers compared samples from 217 men who had given blood more than 100 times in their lives, to samples from 212 men who had donated less than 10 times, to look for any variance in blood health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the differences were subtle, the frequent donors' blood was more likely to have beneficial mutations in a gene called &lt;i&gt;&lt;em&gt;DNMT3A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. Other mutations in &lt;em&gt;DNMT3A&lt;/em&gt; have been &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrc3895"&gt;previously linked&lt;/a&gt; to blood  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="154791" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our work is a fascinating example of how our genes interact with the environment and as we age," &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news-and-features/2025-03-11_beneficial-genetic-changes-observed-in-regular-blood-donors"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="154791" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cell&lt;/a&gt; biologist Dominique Bonnet, from The Francis Crick Institute in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154794" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154794" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BloodCells.jpg" alt="Blood cells in bone marrow" class="wp-image-154794 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BloodCells.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BloodCells-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154794" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Blood cells in bone marrow. (&lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news-and-features/2025-03-11_beneficial-genetic-changes-observed-in-regular-blood-donors"&gt;Hector Huerga Encabo&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the team looked at blood  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stem-cells" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73034" data-postid="154791" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;stem cells&lt;/a&gt;, which produce more blood cells on demand. As we get older, these mechanisms can start to break down, leading to problems with blood cancers such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukemia"&gt;leukemia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood loss triggers the production of the hormone &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erythropoietin"&gt;erythropoietin&lt;/a&gt;. In lab tests on blood stem cells treated with erythropoietin, the researchers found those with the &lt;em&gt;DNMT3A&lt;/em&gt; mutation produced blood faster than those without the mutation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests frequent blood loss leads to more production of the mutated blood cells. Research in mice shows the &lt;em&gt;DNMT3A &lt;/em&gt;mutation results in healthier blood levels after the stress of blood loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Activities that put low levels of stress on blood cell production allow our blood stem cells to renew and we think this favors mutations that further promote stem cell growth rather than disease," &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news-and-features/2025-03-11_beneficial-genetic-changes-observed-in-regular-blood-donors"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bonnet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_154796" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154796" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BloodCell.jpg" alt="Blood cell" class="wp-image-154796 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BloodCell.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/03/BloodCell-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-154796" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A blood cell viewed under an electron microscope. (&lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news-and-features/2025-03-11_beneficial-genetic-changes-observed-in-regular-blood-donors"&gt;Hector Huerga Encabo&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donating blood may better train these stem cells to replace blood in the right way. Follow-up tests in mice backed up that idea of boosting regenerative capacity, without introducing potentially harmful &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-just-identified-hundreds-of-genes-that-could-cause-cancer"&gt;genetic mutations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are limitations to consider. Blood donors are more likely to be healthier anyway (it's a condition of giving blood), so figuring out any additional health benefit is tricky, because it might actually come from being in better shape to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our sample size is quite modest, so we can't say that blood donation definitely decreases the incidence of pre-leukemic mutations," &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news-and-features/2025-03-11_beneficial-genetic-changes-observed-in-regular-blood-donors"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bonnet. "We will need to look at these results in much larger numbers of people."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irrespective of any health benefits – and previous studies &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/regular-blood-donations-can-reduce-the-levels-of-forever-chemicals-in-the-blood"&gt;have found others&lt;/a&gt; – there's an urgent need for blood donors. In the US, someone needs blood or platelets (small fragments in blood) &lt;a href="https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/how-to-donate/how-blood-donations-help/blood-needs-blood-supply.html"&gt;every two seconds&lt;/a&gt;. Having healthier blood is an added bonus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while we wait for more detailed studies to confirm these findings, the study tells us more about how blood cancers can get started in the first place – particularly why dangerous mutations do and don't develop in response to stress – which then points to potential therapy options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're now aiming to work out how these different types of mutations play a role in developing leukemia or not, and whether they can be targeted therapeutically," &lt;a href="https://www.crick.ac.uk/news-and-features/2025-03-11_beneficial-genetic-changes-observed-in-regular-blood-donors"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; stem cell biologist Hector Huerga Encabo, from the Francis Crick Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://ashpublications.org/blood/article/doi/10.1182/blood.2024027999/535979/Clonal-Hematopoiesis-Landscape-in-Frequent-Blood"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dementia"&gt;Ten million people&lt;/a&gt; are diagnosed with dementia worldwide each year – that's more than ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-us/news-and-media/facts-media"&gt;According to the Alzheimer's Society&lt;/a&gt; approximately one million people in the UK are currently living with the disease. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-91178-7"&gt;Studies predict&lt;/a&gt; this figure will rise to 1.6 million people by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="155248" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease is the &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/types-dementia/alzheimers-disease"&gt;most common cause of dementia&lt;/a&gt; and leads to a decline in memory and thinking skills. This is a &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/types-dementia/alzheimers-disease"&gt;physical illness&lt;/a&gt; that causes the brain to stop working properly and &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-alzheimers"&gt;gets worse&lt;/a&gt; over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying the onset of Alzheimer's early can help patients and caregivers find the right support and medical care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way to detect Alzheimer's early is by spotting &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26484921/"&gt;changes to&lt;/a&gt; people's &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09919"&gt;use of language&lt;/a&gt;. This is because &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24142144/"&gt;new speech problems&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3233/JAD-160507"&gt;one of the first signs&lt;/a&gt; of a mental decline that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16193251/"&gt;could indicate the onset&lt;/a&gt; of this disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are five early, speech-related signs of Alzheimer's disease to look out for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Pauses, hesitations, and vagueness&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most recognisable symptoms of Alzheimer's disease is trouble remembering specific words, which can often lead to frequent or long &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3233/JAD-201584"&gt;pauses and hesitations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a person with Alzheimer's is struggling to remember a word, they may talk vaguely such as saying "thing", or describing and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4462568/"&gt;talking around a word&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if someone is having trouble remembering the word dog, they may say something like "people have them as pets … they bark … I used to have one when I was a child".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xXKj3e6ug4w?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Using words with the wrong meaning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trouble remembering the right word can be an early feature of Alzheimer's. People with Alzheimer's might &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1998-12313-008"&gt;replace a word&lt;/a&gt; they are trying to say with something related to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, instead of saying "dog", they might use an animal from the same category, saying "cat" for instance. In the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, however, these changes are more likely to be related to a broader or more general category such as saying "animal" instead of "cat".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Talking about a task rather than doing it&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone with Alzheimer's may struggle with completing tasks. &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1460-6984.12444"&gt;Instead of performing a task&lt;/a&gt;, they may talk about their feelings toward the task, express doubts, or mention past abilities. They might say, "I'm not sure I can do this" or "I used to be good at this", rather than &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3233/JAD-201584"&gt;discussing the task&lt;/a&gt; directly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145448" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145448" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/AlzheimersSeniorLadyTalkingOnPhone642.jpg" alt="An older woman with grey hair and glasses, talking on the phone" class="size-full wp-image-145448" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/AlzheimersSeniorLadyTalkingOnPhone642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/AlzheimersSeniorLadyTalkingOnPhone642-603x415.jpg 603w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/AlzheimersSeniorLadyTalkingOnPhone642-600x413.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145448" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Trouble remembering the right word can be an early feature of Alzheimer's. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MACBY2f2Dks/"&gt;Rido/Canva)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Less word variety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A more subtle indicator of Alzheimer's disease is the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24142144/"&gt;tendency to use&lt;/a&gt; simpler language, &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3233/JAD-201584"&gt;relying on common words&lt;/a&gt;. People with Alzheimer's often repeat the same verbs, nouns and adjectives &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5137196/"&gt;instead of using a broader vocabulary&lt;/a&gt;. They can also use "the", "and" or "but" frequently to connect sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Difficulty finding the right words&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with Alzheimer's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393204000296"&gt;can have trouble&lt;/a&gt; thinking of words, objects or things that belong in a group. This is sometimes used as a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5929311/"&gt;cognitive test&lt;/a&gt; for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, those with Alzheimer's may struggle to name things in a specific category, such as different foods, different parts of the body or words that start with the same letter. This gets harder as the disease progresses, making these tasks increasingly challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age is the biggest risk factor for developing Alzheimer's – the chance of developing the disease &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/about-dementia/types-dementia/alzheimers-disease"&gt;doubles every five years&lt;/a&gt; after the age of 65.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/alzheimers-disease/causes/"&gt;one in 20 people&lt;/a&gt; diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease are under the age of 65. This is referred to as younger – or early-onset Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While forgetting words now and then is normal, persistent and worsening problems remembering words, speaking fluently, or using a variety of words could be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identifying these signs early can be particularly important for people at higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease as they age, such as &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-causes-and-risk-factors/alzheimers-disease-people-down-syndrome"&gt;people with Down Syndrome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/252251/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ars Technica has reached out to the NIH and HHS for comment and will update this story with any new information provided. The agencies did not respond to comment requests from KFF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kennedy’s misinformation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before becoming the top health official in America, Kennedy had long railed against vaccines, becoming one of the world's most prominent anti-vaccine advocates and most prolific spreaders of misinformation and disinformation about vaccines. &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/11/robert-f-kennedy-jr-is-the-single-leading-source-of-anti-vax-ads-on-facebook/"&gt;A 2019 study&lt;/a&gt; found Kennedy was the single leading source of anti-vaccine ads on Facebook. Kennedy subsequently faced bans from &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/09/claims-that-vaccines-are-used-to-track-people-will-now-result-in-youtube-bans/"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/rfk-jrs-anti-vaccine-group-kicked-instagram-facebook-rcna43830"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/02/top-anti-vaxxer-robert-f-kennedy-jr-banned-from-instagram-but-not-facebook/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; for spreading misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers directly blame Kennedy and the Trump administration for the attack on vaccine research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Kennedy’s war on vaccines has started," the mRNA vaccine researcher in Philadelphia told KFF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There will not be any research funded by NIH on mRNA vaccines," the scientist in New York similar told the outlet. "MAGA people are convinced that these vaccines have killed and maimed tens of thousands of people. It’s not true, but they believe that."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has made various statements against vaccines generally, as well as mRNA vaccines specifically. He falsely claimed the vaccine causes severe harms, including causing neurodegenerative diseases, &lt;a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1482157837354737668"&gt;such as Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt;. In 2021, during the height of the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/petition.pdf"&gt;Kennedy petitioned the Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; to revoke the authorization of COVID-19 vaccines and refrain from approving any future COVID-19 vaccines. A study in 2022, meanwhile, estimated that the vaccines had &lt;a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/two-years-covid-vaccines-prevented-millions-deaths-hospitalizations"&gt;saved more than 3 million lives&lt;/a&gt; and prevented more than 18 million hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NIH's recent moves aren't the first sign that Kennedy will use his powerful position to attack mRNA vaccines. Late last month, Bloomberg reported that HHS was considering canceling a &lt;a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2025/Moderna-Announces-Updates-on-Pandemic-Influenza-Program/default.aspx"&gt;$590 million grant to vaccine maker Moderna&lt;/a&gt; to develop &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-26/trump-team-weighs-pulling-funding-for-moderna-bird-flu-vaccine"&gt;mRNA vaccines against potential pandemic influenza&lt;/a&gt; viruses. That includes the H5N1 virus that is currently devastating US poultry and spreading wildly in dairy cows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An HHS spokesperson told media at the time that "While it is crucial that the US Department and Health and Human Services support pandemic preparedness, four years of the Biden administration’s failed oversight have made it necessary to review agreements for vaccine production."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear what is happening with that grant review. Moderna declined to comment when Ars reached out for any potential updates Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="0" class="story_para_0"&gt;Social media is a place where trends constantly emerge and influencers play a major role in prompting them. But blindly following these trends can lead to dangerous consequences as seen in the case of a US-based influencer. Eve Catherine, a Dallas-based influencer, ended up in the hospital after consuming excessive protein while following the viral “carnivore diet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="1" class="story_para_1"&gt;The diet, which has gained popularity in recent years, focuses on eating only animal-based foods such as beef, poultry, pork, fish and other animal byproducts. Many influencers, including podcast host Joe Rogan, have praised it. But health experts have warned that this extreme way of eating can lead to serious health issues, New York Post reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="2" class="story_para_2"&gt;Eve Catherine shared her experience on TikTok where she disclosed her diet that comprises eating two or three eggs for breakfast, high-protein yogurt for lunch and a New York strip steak for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="3" class="story_para_3"&gt;During a routine check-up, her doctor noticed high protein levels in her urine but she didn’t take it seriously at the time. Then, one day, she woke up to find she was urinating blood. She was rushed to the emergency room, put on morphine and diagnosed with a kidney stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="4" class="story_para_4"&gt;“I literally woke up one day and I was peeing straight blood," she recalled in her video. She also admitted that she had been “addicted to protein" before the health scare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="5" class="story_para_5"&gt;After her hospitalisation, she called the carnivore diet “stupid" and urged her followers to be cautious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="6" class="story_para_6"&gt;“Don’t eat too much protein, OK? Don’t neglect your fiber intake," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="7" class="story_para_7"&gt;Medical experts have long warned about the risks of consuming too much protein especially for those with underlying kidney issues. The Mayo Clinic states that high-protein diets can strain the kidneys, making it harder for the body to filter out waste. Moreover, these diets often lack fiber which can lead to digestive problems like constipation, headaches and bad breath. Eating excessive amounts of red meat and processed meats can also increase the risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="8" class="story_para_8"&gt;Despite these warnings, many social media users dismissed Catherine’s experience in the comments. But there were others who thanked her for speaking out and raising awareness about the dangers of extreme diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="9" class="story_para_9"&gt;Catherine isn’t the only one to face serious health issues from following the carnivore diet. A man from Florida, in his mid-40s, also experienced severe side effects after sticking to the meat- and dairy-heavy diet for around eight months. He ended up in the hospital with yellowish, ooze-producing nodules on his palms, elbows and soles of his feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="jsx-7ca078c3173863e4 jsx-2823269365 atbtlink Location"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Location :&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="rs"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Delhi, India, India&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div class="jsx-7ca078c3173863e4 jsx-2823269365 brdcrmb"&gt;&lt;a href="/"&gt;News&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="/viral/"&gt;viral&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;span class="brdout"&gt; US Influencer Follows Viral Carnivore Diet, Lands In Hospital With Kidney Stone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="jsx-7ca078c3173863e4 jsx-2823269365 nxtartseprator"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News18</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 21:58:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>This Superfood You’ve Never Heard of Could Change the Way We Eat - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxQbFpwOWlyYldsenotNk0wM19zblBRY1I2ZDV4Tjh6OEdNMHJUSkppdUF6UlgwSVhYYndPalk2bmFwZldxMFljX2xPM2lna2gya08yVXdnTGU4SVhCcl9wSGI5Sk9WSC1GM0tCZi02QTJYNXhBVnpkdTEwSm92S1BRU1N3UEhDXzBKZTN1bGlrTDBMcjQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Mon, 17 Mar 2025 21:26:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxQbFpwOWlyYldsenotNk0wM19zblBRY1I2ZDV4Tjh6OEdNMHJUSkppdUF6UlgwSVhYYndPalk2bmFwZldxMFljX2xPM2lna2gya08yVXdnTGU4SVhCcl9wSGI5Sk9WSC1GM0tCZi02QTJYNXhBVnpkdTEwSm92S1BRU1N3UEhDXzBKZTN1bGlrTDBMcjQ</guid></item></channel></rss>
