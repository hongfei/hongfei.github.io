Men are more likely to die from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The paradox, revealed in a &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2837792?resultClick=24#250506426" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of the country's latest cancer registry, tells a story at once simple and confounding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Women account for just over half of all new cases, but men make up the majority of deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;India appears to be an outlier. In 2022, for every 100,000 people worldwide, on average about 197 were diagnosed with cancer that year. Men fared worse, at 212, compared to 186 for women, according to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.wcrf.org/preventing-cancer/cancer-statistics/global-cancer-data-by-country/page/2/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;World Cancer Research Fund&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Nearly 20 million cancer cases were diagnosed globally in 2022 - about 10.3 million in men and 9.7 million in women. In the US, the estimated lifetime risk of cancer is nearly equal for men and women, according to the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In India, the most common cancers among women are breast, cervical, and ovarian. Breast and cervical cancers make up 40% of female cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;While cervical cancer is largely linked to infections such as human papillomavirus (HPV), breast and ovarian cancers are often influenced by hormonal factors. Rising cases of these hormone-related cancers are also associated with lifestyle shifts - including later pregnancies, reduced breastfeeding, obesity, and sedentary habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;For men, oral, lung, and prostate cancers dominate. Tobacco drives 40% of preventable cancers, mainly oral and lung.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;So what is going on in India? Is it an earlier diagnosis for women? Are men's cancers more aggressive, or is it that habits such as smoking and chewing tobacco drag down their outcomes? Or does the answer lie in differences in access, awareness and treatment between genders?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-86c96223-1 evkFpM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-86c96223-0 iMuqLZ hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4951/live/21fcadf0-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Gautam Bose People wearing skeleton outfits take part in a rally encouraging others not to use tobacco products in Kolkata, India, on May 31, 2025.

Their cancers are more often tied to lifestyle - tobacco and alcohol drive lung and oral cancers, both aggressive and less responsive to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Men are also less likely to go for preventive check-ups or seek medical help early. The result: higher mortality and poorer outcomes, even when incidence is lower than among women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Women's health has become a bigger focus in public health campaigns, and that's a double-edged sword. Greater awareness and screening mean more cancers are detected early. For men, the conversation rarely goes beyond tobacco and oral cancer," Ravi Mehrotra, a cancer specialist and head of the non-profit Centre for Health Innovation and Policy (CHIP) Foundation, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Women, through reproductive health checks, are more likely to see a doctor at some stage. Many men, by contrast, may go their whole lives without ever seeing one," Dr Mehrotra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But the real story emerges when the numbers are broken down: India's cancer burden is unevenly spread across regions, and across the types of cancer people face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Data from 43 registries show that 11 out of every 100 people in India run the risk of developing cancer at some point during their life. An estimated 1.56 million cases and 874,000 deaths are projected for 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The hilly and relatively remote northeast region remains India's cancer hotspot, with Mizoram's Aizawl district recording lifetime risks twice the national average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Doctors say much of this is down to lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"For most cancers in the north-eastern state, I'm convinced lifestyle is the key factor. Tobacco use is rampant here - much higher than elsewhere," R Ravi Kannan, head of Cachar Cancer Hospital and Research Centre in Assam, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"In Barak Valley in Assam, it's mostly chewing tobacco; just 25km away in Mizoram, smoking dominates. Add to that alcohol, areca nuts, and even how meat is prepared. Food choices and preparation drive cancer risk. There's no special cancer-causing gene at play - hereditary cancers aren't more common here than in other parts of India," Dr Kannan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But the pattern isn't confined to the northeast. Srinagar in Indian-administered Kashmir tops the charts for lung cancer in men, while southern Hyderabad city leads in breast cancer. Men in the capital, Delhi, are being diagnosed with all cancers put together at a higher rate than men in other regions, even after correcting for age differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Oral cancer is also rising: 14 population registries report increases among men and four among women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jHorPx"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-86c96223-1 evkFpM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250905-110137-f27f908f49-web-2.29.1-3/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-86c96223-0 iMuqLZ hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/48cd/live/2d96cd80-8dff-11f0-91df-f12ad8d72474.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="AFP via Getty Images A woman sits beside Malsawm Puia, 28, who suffers from blood cancer, in Kale township on the India-Myanmar border, on April 17, 2024.

The disparities seen across Indian states mirror a global divide shaped by geography, income, and access to care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In wealthy nations, one in 12 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during her lifetime, but only one in 71 will die from it, according to WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In poorer countries, the picture is reversed: just one in 27 women will ever receive a diagnosis, yet as many as one in 48 will die of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Women in lower Human Development Index (HDI) countries are 50% less likely to be diagnosed with breast cancer than women in high HDI countries, yet they are at a much higher risk of dying of the disease due to late diagnosis and inadequate access to quality treatment," says Isabelle Soerjomataram, Deputy Head of the Cancer Surveillance Branch at International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Then there are other differences. In the US, for example, native Americans face the highest cancer mortality, with kidney, liver, stomach, and cervical cancer deaths two to three times higher than whites; black people also have double the mortality of whites for prostate, stomach, and uterine cancers, according to American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In India, the cancer burden is not just growing - it is becoming more complex. Registry data reflect a society in transition, where longevity, lifestyle, and environment are reshaping health risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Yet amid this shifting landscape, many questions remain, underscoring the urgent need for targeted prevention, early detection, and lifestyle changes, including healthier diets and habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;i id="follow-bbc-news-india-on" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;Follow BBC News India on &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsindia/" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;&lt;i id="instagram" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;Instagram&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="," class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@bbcnewsindia/featured" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;&lt;i id="youtube," class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;YouTube,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/BBCIndia" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;&lt;i id="x" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;X&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="and" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcindia/" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;&lt;i id="facebook" class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;Facebook&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i id="." class="sc-d16436d-0 gbdkAi"&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 00:32:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE5nZkxMcFRTdVp3aXE2OUNkV0JLMGVCV2ZZMEhzb2ZHaTZuS1J2aEp3aGxwV3JrMWt6aUZuV1ZzMnpSeHAzTkh5X2RUOVgzTmcwNWxBMGtTdS1WZ9IBX0FVX3lxTE1UdjZyQXE2VGJsV2tHOFJiZXVNMnFfLWVBWWlRVGhoWjBoM2VZVXlxYWZ6bDR1VWpFalpyTWlQcmV2ejhmU0tDVUxRbEEtRk1Ia2U4eEFvM3RsMDB4N2lZ</guid></item><item><title>心理学研究人员确定了“极端主义倦怠”的渠道- PsyPost</title><link>http://www.psypost.org/psychology-researchers-identify-a-burnout-to-extremism-pipeline/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Luigi Mangione was arrested for the alleged murder of the CEO of UnitedHealthcare in December 2024, public reaction shocked observers. Far from universal condemnation, many people expressed support. This was especially true among younger people, with polls showing &lt;a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/december-2024-national-poll-young-voters-diverge-from-majority-on-crypto-tiktok-and-ceo-assassination/"&gt;41% of young adults&lt;/a&gt; viewed the murder as acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what leads the average person to justify extreme violence? &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/vio0000643"&gt;Our recently published research&lt;/a&gt;, in the special issue &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/vio/understanding-violent-extremism"&gt;“Understanding violent extremism”&lt;/a&gt; of the APA &lt;em&gt;Journal Psychology of Violence&lt;/em&gt;, locates the answer in one increasingly widespread phenomenon: workplace burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mangione’s &lt;a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/luigis-manifesto"&gt;manifesto&lt;/a&gt; cites “corruption and greed” as a source of frustration, a sentiment that resonates widely amid growing dissatisfaction with modern work environments. &lt;a href="https://clinicalsocialwork.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cswhi_03_2024_02_butz_OPR_04.pdf"&gt;Recent research&lt;/a&gt; shows that broader patterns of systemic frustration and perceived corruption are associated with burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study, which took daily surveys from over 600 employees, suggests burnout may quietly fuel worrying attitudes – specifically, the potential justification of violent extremism – towards the perceived source of their distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The burnout to extremism pipeline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our study, employees made daily notes of their burnout symptoms, emotional states, and violent extremist attitudes. On days when employees felt more burnt out, they reported significantly more sympathy toward extremist ideas, such as justifying violence against perceived injustices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The daily grind of burnout produced negative feelings of fear, sadness, shame, and guilt. To alleviate these negative feelings – and regain a sense of purpose – some individuals appeared to find extremist ideologies more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon can be explained through the combined lens of three established psychological theories. The first is &lt;a href="https://oxfordre.com/criminology/display/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264079.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264079-e-249"&gt;General Strain Theory&lt;/a&gt;, which suggests that daily frustrations lead to violent extremism through the experience of negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second is the &lt;a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315227979-4/burnout-existential-perspective-ayala-pines"&gt;existential model of burnout&lt;/a&gt;, which links burnout to a failed existential quest when meaningfulness in work disappears. Last is &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1037/gpr0000144"&gt;Significance Quest Theory&lt;/a&gt;, which argues that when the sense of personal significance is eroded in people’s everyday lives, they might look elsewhere, including to radical beliefs, to restore meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In combination, these ideas, particularly the existential and Significance Quest models, suggest that burnout reflects a failed search for meaning – one that may drive individuals toward violent extremism as a means of restoration. General Strain Theory further contributes by emphasising the emotional path involved in this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why burnout matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study does not suggest that individuals experiencing burnout will inevitably engage in extremist violence. Rather, it demonstrates how everyday experiences of burnout can subtly shift individuals toward violent extremist attitudes, thereby normalising the acceptance of violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This distinction is critical and is emphasised in the &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Famp0000062"&gt;two-pyramids model&lt;/a&gt;, which differentiates between radicalisation of opinion and radicalisation of action. While the link between the two may be weak, radicalisation of opinion alone can pose a &lt;a href="https://www.ijcv.org/index.php/ijcv/article/view/3807"&gt;serious threat to democracies and open societies&lt;/a&gt; by eroding social cohesion and fostering polarisation. For this reason, it warrants focused study in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, workplace burnout is alarmingly common, affecting approximately &lt;a href="https://www.vanede.nl/media/2669/gallup-iii-employee-burnout.pdf"&gt;three in four employees&lt;/a&gt;. This means a huge portion of the workforce experiences the emotional strain capable of fuelling extremist ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the vast majority will never resort to violence, a society that becomes increasingly tolerant of extremist attitudes risks normalising destructive behaviours and undermining both democratic values and workplace cohesion. Moreover, even if only a small minority ultimately engage in violence, the consequences can still be profound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Organisational support can help&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings also reveal an effective form of protection: &lt;a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf&amp;amp;doi=b6e9be0e81ee13424f7140685a689bd2d85d7d3c"&gt;perceived organisational support&lt;/a&gt;. Employees who felt that their organisations genuinely valued their contributions and cared about their wellbeing were less likely to gravitate toward extremist ideologies, even when experiencing burnout symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there’s a critical caveat to this: organisational support is most effective at mitigating the harmful effects of burnout before negative emotions take hold. Once employees have crossed that emotional threshold, additional support alone has limited power to prevent the escalation toward violent extremist attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employers therefore hold the key to addressing burnout before it escalates into something more serious. Organisations must proactively invest in burnout prevention, not merely as a health initiative, but as a vital strategy for preserving stability, both in the workplace and in society at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means promoting fairness and transparency in the workplace, ensuring employees feel recognised and valued, training managers to identify early signs of burnout and respond proactively, and establishing open, safe channels for employee feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns about fairness don’t stop at the office door. Broader perceptions of injustice in society may also fuel extremist sympathies, especially when individuals are already mentally exhausted. For instance, efforts to pursue the &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-pamela-bondi-directs-prosecutors-seek-death-penalty-luigi-mangione"&gt;death penalty against Mangione to serve President Trump’s political agenda&lt;/a&gt; may deepen perceptions of systemic unfairness, which will only exacerbate radical views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The broader implications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burnout is more than just workplace exhaustion or disengagement. It signals a deeper and more dangerous existential vulnerability. A workplace that ignores employee burnout doesn’t just risk lower productivity – it creates a breeding ground for ideological radicalisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As both workplaces and societies confront a surge in extremist sentiment, including support for violent acts framed as resistance to corporate greed, it is crucial that we learn to recognise the underlying psychological triggers. Burnout is one of them, and employees don’t just need support to do their jobs better – they need it to maintain a sense of meaning, stability, and connection in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A burnt-out mind will seek meaning wherever it can find it. If the workplace fails to offer that, extremist ideologies are often ready to fill the void, with consequences that reach far beyond the office walls.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261123/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261123/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

Why so? Because the first meal of the day replenishes glucose levels, boosting energy and alertness after an overnight fast. It also kickstarts your metabolism, improves focus and memory, helps regulate blood sugar and appetite to prevent overeating later in the day, and provides essential nutrients like vitamins, minerals, fiber, and calcium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, many people are aware of the fact that a nutritious breakfast contributes to better heart health and overall well-being, and encourages healthier eating habits. But did you know how important it is to consume breakfast on time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Beat belly fat with millets: Easy breakfast ideas for quick weight loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43856-025-01035-x" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;A new study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; is shedding light on the surprising link between meal timings and longevity, suggesting that delaying breakfast is linked with a higher risk of death, along with other health issues such as fatigue, depression, poor sleep, and oral health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to know more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What the study says&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the saying now goes: How late you eat the first meal of the day might be just as important as what’s on the plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/09/early-breakfast-could-help-you-live-longer/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;major new study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; following nearly 3,000 adults aged 42-94 over more than 20 years, suggests that delaying breakfast is linked with a higher risk of death, along with other health issues such as fatigue, depression, poor sleep, and oral health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Mass General Brigham (Harvard-affiliated) and the University of Manchester analyzed data from 2,945 UK adults aged between 42 and 94, tracking them for about 22 years, to see how changes in the timing of breakfast and dinner relate to health and mortality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by Dr. Hassan Dashti (Massachusetts General Hospital) in collaboration with the University of Manchester, the research added fresh evidence to the growing field of chrononutrition – the idea that the timing of meals (not just what we eat) influences health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that as people grow older, meal times tend to drift later – both breakfast and dinner – and the overall eating window (time in a day during which people eat) becomes narrower. The most eye-opening result? For each extra hour breakfast was delayed, there was about an 8-11% higher risk of mortality (death from any cause) during the follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, late breakfast times were linked with other health problems. Many participants who ate late also reported poorer sleep, fatigue, depression, difficulty preparing meals, and worse oral health. Those are signs not just of bad habits but sometimes of under-recognized health issues. Genetic predisposition to “late chronotype” (natural inclination to stay up late and wake up later) was also associated with later breakfast times, suggesting some of the timing shift may be built in, or influenced by internal body clocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why &lt;keyword id="14175499" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="breakfast-timing" source="Orion"&gt;breakfast timing&lt;/keyword&gt; might matter&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just about being an early bird and someone who chooses to stick to the clock a bit too religiously. There are several biological, lifestyle, and psychological reasons timing seems to make a difference, especially in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Circadian rhythms:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our body’s internal clock regulates many functions, like sleep, digestion, hormone release, and metabolism. When you delay eating relative to waking time, you may misalign your meals with optimal metabolic windows. That could reduce how well nutrients are processed and increase stress on systems (e.g., glucose regulation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sleep and energy:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Later breakfasts often go hand-in-hand with poorer sleep, fatigue, or disrupted routines. If you wake late or sleep badly, your body may already be under strain; so eating late might be more of an ‘effect’ than a ‘cause’ in some people. Also, delayed eating may reduce total energy/nutrient intake early in the day, which can affect metabolism and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Behavioral and functional implications:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Older adults who have mobility issues, depression, dental problems, or fatigue may find it harder to prepare or access breakfast early, or may simply not feel hungry until later. These health challenges themselves are risk factors for mortality. Thus, breakfast time might be a marker rather than just a lever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What you should do: &lt;keyword id="3045780" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="longevity-hacks" source="Orion"&gt;Longevity hacks&lt;/keyword&gt; and practical tips&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to use this insight to support better health (especially as you age), here are some simple, actionable recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Eat breakfast earlier, close to when you wake up:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Try to have breakfast within one to two hours after waking. If you wake at 6-7 AM, aim for breakfast by 8-9 AM rather than delaying until late morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Maintain consistent mealtimes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just like sleep, being regular with when you eat helps your body expect food, regulate hormones, digestion, and energy levels. A schedule like breakfast around 7-9 AM, lunch around noon, dinner before 6-8 PM can help anchor your day. Missing or delaying meals often disrupts the rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Prioritize breakfast quality:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; What you eat matters. A protein-rich, fiber-full breakfast helps stabilize blood sugar, supports digestion, and gives staying power. Think eggs + veggies, oatmeal with nuts/fruit, yogurt with seeds, whole grain toast + protein. Skipping or having sugary breakfast items may give quick energy but less sustained benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Look after sleep and wake patterns:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since late chronotype, poor sleep, or delayed wake times are associated with eating late, improving sleep hygiene can help. Going to bed earlier, maintaining consistent wake-up times, and limiting exposure to screens before bed – all of these help reset internal clocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Monitor health signs and routines:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you notice fatigue, depression, difficulty preparing meals, oral health problems, or gradually delaying meals, these may be early warning signs worth discussing with your healthcare provider. Mealtime shifts may be easier to track than many other health markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Avoid heavy meals close to bedtime:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eating dinner too late or snacking heavily late in the evening can further skew your eating window and may compound the negative effects of a late breakfast. Light dinners, earlier evenings, and minimizing snacking can help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 00:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwJBVV95cUxNbzRSN1lGekk2eVdDbFREOTdPUUM3U0hwNlBFSVlQRTRXUlU1RTNzVW9qWk80a3JJOU1vd3AxM3pnZVg4RWhWbFVRZE4wNTVTYzg3akRPNWpITmNrU1o0cWRxN2U0SldqaFM4ai1tRGhOMkkxQllQdnFSUWNzTHJKOUhOVTIyQzR2QnQtMjZLdXhuYkZMdVpmMzAzd29xaVFkSlViVnFVZ2wzSGVlN0ZNSF91TlM0MDlzSlQ5WGJYWDR1TFUxM3FQeXo2NVNPbngzYmIyYTZjNUlSTzhzUXJITmEweHVjLWxIdmdmWjdvQkw2TmR0cHZzc0tiVzBvMEppSzJqc0pDQkNIeFZNNDk1T0VkOVh5aHY2YjRNeDdPV1paaE5TOG45M05SRnNYQzA</guid></item><item><title>权衡激素治疗更年期的益处和风险，因为FDA考虑删除“黑匣子”警告- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hrt-for-menopause-risks-benefits-fda-black-box-warnings/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hot flashes and sleepless nights are just some of the symptoms of perimenopause that have been disrupting Isabel Kallman's life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 53 years old, Kallman's hormones naturally started to decline, and the only medication available for her is menopause hormone therapy. For women experiencing the lead-up to menopause, hormone therapy treatment can involve using estrogen to help alleviate symptoms — but Kallman said she has been on the fence about it due to so-called "black box" labels on the medication, warning of the risk for stroke, blood clots, dementia and breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kallman told CBS News she has been using "Fanny," a handheld fan that she keeps in her bag to help with some of her symptoms. But now she's considering hormone replacement as the Food and Drug Administration weighs removing some of the health warnings for &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hormone-therapy-breast-cancer-risk-study/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;certain treatments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mary Rosser, who has been Kallman's doctor for five years, said she believes flawed research from more than 20 years ago overstated the risks of breast cancer because it focused on older women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's been overblown," Dr. Rosser, the director of Integrated Women's Health at Columbia University Irving Medical Center/NewYork-Presbyterian, told CBS News.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2002 &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/shifting-world-of-womens-health/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Women's Health Initiative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the largest long-term study on women's health at the time, focused on older women who may not have started hormone replacement therapy until 10 or so years after going through &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/menopause-grown-woman-talk-obgyn/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which raised safety concerns and led to a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hormone-therapy-menopause-slow-aging/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;longtime public misunderstanding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; around hormone therapy, has since been found problematic in terms of how it was designed, according to Dr. Céline Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News. Now, health care professionals say factors such as age and dosing contribute to the safety of the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recent studies show that timing of treatment matters — a woman's age when she begins menopause hormone therapy, along with the delivery method, can substantially mitigate risks, Gounder says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's "an example of [how] science evolves," Gounder said of recent studies. Hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for a lot of perimenopausal symptoms, according to Gounder, who stressed that patients need to sit down with their doctors to determine what is right for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, treatment should start as close to the patient's final menstrual period and continue until about the age of 60, Dr. Rosser says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have to look at your risk and calculate your risk score," Dr. Rosser told Kallman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rosser has spent the past nine months working through the &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/study-shows-hormone-therapy-can-benefit-womens-health-during-menopause/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;benefits&lt;/a&gt; and risks with her patient, who has a family history of breast cancer. While Kallman said she's still hesitant, she realizes hormone therapy may be her best chance at relief. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm hoping that there is an opportunity for me to do it," Kallman told CBS News, adding that she hopes there's an option that will help her in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One type of treatment is low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy. Others include whole-body therapy like &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pill-hot-flashes-women-menopause/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;pills&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, patches, sprays, gels or a vaginal ring that deliver doses of hormones into the bloodstream at levels high enough to have significant effects on symptoms such as hot flashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As experts like Dr. Rosser continue to have conversations about how to present the treatment's pros and cons, an FDA-assembled panel has stressed the benefits and suggested health warnings be removed from at least some versions. However, dozens of experts called for more input before making any changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A letter signed by 76 doctors and researchers argues that "removing label warnings without adequate scientific assessment puts patients at risk," The Associated Press reported. The group asked the FDA to hold an advisory committee meeting with a public hearing before making any changes.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc4" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",4]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rosser said she sees it as a step in the right direction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a public health priority, and this is a sign that the FDA sees that," she told CBS News.&lt;/p&gt;

That genes are passed on from parent to child through &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1933/summary/" target="_blank"&gt;chromosomes&lt;/a&gt;. That a &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2017/press-release/" target="_blank"&gt;gene called period&lt;/a&gt; helps our bodies keep time — and that disruptions to that internal clock can lead to jet lag and increased risk for neurological and metabolic diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-39c94e" class="body-graf"&gt;Those discoveries, along with nearly 90,000 other studies, are part of a key online database called FlyBase that researchers routinely use to help them more quickly design new experiments. These tests explore the underlying causes of disease and could help with the development of new treatments. Science builds on prior insights, and a handy repository of past advances serves as kindling for future discoveries.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-02c461" class="body-graf"&gt;The website receives about 770,000 page views each month from scientists working around the world on &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(21)00180-2" target="_blank"&gt;developing personalized therapies&lt;/a&gt; for rare cancers, &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/genetics/article/201/2/377/5930058" target="_blank"&gt;modeling human neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ahg.12554" target="_blank"&gt;screening drug candidates for conditions like Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1fc638" class="body-graf"&gt;Now, that critical resource is on the brink of layoffs that endanger its future and ability to make research more efficient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c2c4cc" class="body-graf"&gt;This spring, the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Trump administration, as part of its broader $2.2 billion funding cuts at Harvard University, rescinded a grant used to maintain FlyBase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ae9a85" class="body-graf"&gt;“I use FlyBase every single day. It’s so essential,” said Celeste Berg, a professor of genome sciences at the University of Washington, who is not part of the team that operates FlyBase. “What we know about human genes and how they function comes almost completely from model systems like drosophila.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8d1035" class="body-graf"&gt;Humans share about 60% of our genes with fruit flies, also known by their scientific name &lt;em&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ea3100" class="body-graf"&gt;FlyBase’s now-uncertain future highlights just how interconnected and interdependent research efforts are and how the effects of funding cuts to one institution can ripple worldwide. More than 4,000 labs use FlyBase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c60506" class="body-graf"&gt;Harvard was receiving about $2 million a year in federal funding to maintain FlyBase, which was the vast majority of the website’s total operating budget. But the University of New Mexico, Indiana University and the University of Cambridge in England are partners that help Harvard manage FlyBase and are beneficiaries, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-453ac6" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is not just affecting Harvard,” said Brian Calvi, a professor of biology at Indiana University, who is part of the FlyBase management team. “The ripple effect is to the international biomedical research community.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c9dcbb" class="body-graf"&gt;Harvard’s Faculty of Arts and Sciences rescued FlyBase with interim funding, but that support will cease in October, according to Norbert Perrimon, a professor of developmental biology at Harvard Medical School. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-af2643" class="body-graf"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/judge-orders-trump-administration-unfreeze-nearly-22-billion-federal-g-rcna228926" target="_blank"&gt;judge earlier this month ordered the Trump administration to restore funding&lt;/a&gt; to Harvard researchers who lost grants, but money has not begun to flow to FlyBase, Perrimon said. The administration has promised to appeal the decision, which could halt the flow of funds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-219b4a" class="body-graf"&gt;The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the National Institutes of Health, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e0dd35" class="body-graf"&gt;The Transmitter, a neuroscience news site, &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.thetransmitter.org/community/harvard-university-lays-off-fly-database-team/__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!uF_mslZG8c0kkW2n_ojZOpLFIRPvNSfqv6-3-pbt6-RvAE2bVt8Jn5BxGr7eQwUclBAlt8XyAnFu7G6jnPSfzhMChhdd$" target="_blank"&gt;first reported about layoffs at FlyBase&lt;/a&gt;. The Harvard Crimson reported about the Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/9/9/flybase-funding/__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!uF_mslZG8c0kkW2n_ojZOpLFIRPvNSfqv6-3-pbt6-RvAE2bVt8Jn5BxGr7eQwUclBAlt8XyAnFu7G6jnPSfzm6clJ6W$" target="_blank"&gt;decision not to continue with interim funding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5294de" class="body-graf"&gt;Calvi said the FlyBase grant provided full or partial salary for eight people at Harvard, three at Indiana, five at Cambridge and one at the University of New Mexico. Both Indiana and Cambridge were able to secure funds to keep their portion of the program operating into next year. The New Mexico position ended in August. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7deafd" class="body-graf"&gt;FlyBase, which has been operating since 1992, has received federal support for more than three decades. It curates and summarizes research papers, organizes findings about particular genes, and catalogs information about fruit flies that have been modified genetically to tease apart how certain genes guide normal development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-817034" class="body-graf"&gt;Fruit flies are among the most important animal models for biomedical research because scientists have been able to map their genomes and brains. They’re also relatively easy and cheap to handle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-277cb2" class="body-graf"&gt;Berg, the genome sciences professor and avid FlyBase user, studies human development and how cells form organs. FlyBase allows her to search and identify genes of interest for experiments. She then tests how changing the expression of those genes affects the arrangement of cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4520d0" class="body-graf"&gt;Every year, thousands of fruit fly papers are added to FlyBase and summarized. Without FlyBase, Berg said researchers and clinicians would struggle to keep up and could miss key connections about particular genes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-56f6fc" class="body-graf"&gt;Researchers with the &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://undiagnosed.hms.harvard.edu/research/model-organisms-phase-ii/__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!uF_mslZG8c0kkW2n_ojZOpLFIRPvNSfqv6-3-pbt6-RvAE2bVt8Jn5BxGr7eQwUclBAlt8XyAnFu7G6jnPSfzqmPDx5s$" target="_blank"&gt;Undiagnosed Diseases Network&lt;/a&gt; use FlyBase to help identify whether genetic mutations in children could be contributing to rare and unexplained diseases. The scientists identify genetic variants in these patients and then compare those mutations to past research of those genes in flies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-54a947" class="body-graf"&gt;FlyBase is now crowdfunding support on its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9b19b3" class="body-graf"&gt;“Given the importance of FlyBase to the broader U.S. and international scientific research community, we are hopeful other institutions and other stakeholders at Harvard will support those efforts,” said James Chisholm, a spokesman for Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences, adding that several Harvard departments were “actively working to identify and secure additional funding to safeguard FlyBase’s operations.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b03d63" class="body-graf"&gt;Two Harvard-based staffers have already been laid off from their work at FlyBase, and another six are scheduled for layoffs later in September and in early October, Perrimon said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2001d5" class="body-graf"&gt;“If we cannot retain the key personnel, it’s going to be very difficult to get back those people who have knowledge to keep the databases running,” Perrimon said. “That would be the point of no return for FlyBase.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c1d4b5" class="body-graf"&gt;The funding disruption is also threatening plans to move FlyBase’s data to a new long-term home called the Alliance of Genome Resources. Fruit flies are among several common “model organisms,” along with rats, mice and worms, that are used in laboratories and lay the groundwork for understanding human biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3b5cc3" class="body-graf"&gt;The National Institutes of Health has spent about &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://reporter.nih.gov/search/aP_gy-lZWES6IOBy6zZN3A/project-details/10976322__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!uF_mslZG8c0kkW2n_ojZOpLFIRPvNSfqv6-3-pbt6-RvAE2bVt8Jn5BxGr7eQwUclBAlt8XyAnFu7G6jnPSfzh8OYkhq$" target="_blank"&gt;$5 million a year since 2017&lt;/a&gt; to merge several databases, including FlyBase, WormBase and the Mouse Genome Database, among a handful of others. Each contains information that human health researchers can cross-reference to study genes important for human health more efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-25e41c" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you’re studying human genes and you have to study everything that’s known, you have to go to all of these [websites] and learn the system,” said Paul Sternberg, a professor of biology at the California Institute of Technology, who is leading the Alliance effort. “We want one-stop shopping.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fe1314" class="body-graf"&gt;The Alliance’s budget expired June 30, and Sternberg said he is awaiting a funding renewal decision from NIH himself. He said the funding disruption at FlyBase represents a new, unexpected obstacle to making&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;research findings more useful and easier to scour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fcf2e0" class="body-graf"&gt;“We need to do this fast, but when you’re losing staff and energy, that’s what makes it dicey,” Sternberg said. “Don’t throw extra roadblocks. That’s all we ask.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b0b8ac" class="body-graf"&gt;FlyBase had planned to merge with the Alliance in 2029. Now, Calvi and others are pushing for a speedier merger, before FlyBase’s financial runway runs out. The donations the organization is seeking are meant to help pay for that.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-25a327" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“So far it’s less than $100,000,” Calvi said of the organization’s crowdfunding efforts. “We probably need a million.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 22:00:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixAFBVV95cUxPalpqTE1rZzkyaXg0S2c3blZkQzVWRWdpaXF6RHJhRXlzZlVwbXcxZ2J6emdwV2JOUnp5eEUxZ0RKenNVSWU1ZDMtNmVGXzU5OW55UV8tVW4wUmpmOFI1TnNoQTVSdXBsTzlHR1BabWZrbW5lRjJxZzZ5bmMyY2Vxb21aWUtDLVBTSmNGejNYZnZTLVZIRVFXaElHNG95TWdEWFpGbmQtbEhHR2ZxdjJTUW50bXNGc0tIYXlHZXNhRlVUa1dR0gFWQVVfeXFMTm00eEdrdktyLUdBZXJLcVFiNWdYNklpNkxyUUNNRzd2WVRLcEtFRzdFbU9nMjdtX3VKZkVzU0JxdW9fSUg5UWppU2JBSTg2VFdIeXlpQkE</guid></item><item><title>斯坦福大学的新研究有更多理由讨厌夏令时- SFGATE</title><link>https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/stanford-daylight-saving-time-health-21049551.php</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="rel"&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:-mx40 lg:-mx56 x100vw sm:cw-80 lg:cw-112 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;FILE: An aerial view of Stanford University, in Palo Alto,  Calif.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;yujie chen/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daylight saving time is not only jarring but also unhealthy, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2508293122" data-link="native" class=""&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Stanford scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences show clear biological costs to the fall-back, spring-forward routine, which Californians &lt;a href="https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/What-s-going-to-happen-with-Daylight-Saving-Time-13372427.php" data-link="native" class=""&gt;have already voted to abolish&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="A300" data-large-id="Inline-1" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study says the current schedule, where almost all states adopt daylight saving time for eight months each year, disrupts our circadian rhythms and can lead to more strokes and obesity. The research adds to prior reports of spikes in &lt;a href="https://openheart.bmj.com/content/1/1/e000019" data-link="native" class=""&gt;heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/apl9451317.pdf" data-link="native" class=""&gt;injuries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32008905/" data-link="native" class=""&gt;traffic crashes&lt;/a&gt; after people lose an hour of sleep when daylight saving time starts in March. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is the first real piece of evidence that staying in permanent standard time would be better, from a biological perspective, than either permanent daylight saving time or the current shift twice per year,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/jamie-zeitzer" data-link="native" class=""&gt;Jamie Zeitzer&lt;/a&gt;, Ph.D., a Stanford psychiatry and behavioral sciences professor and the study’s senior author. “Until now, we’ve just had theories.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zeitzer and his colleague found major health benefits to ending the spring forward from standard time to daylight saving time. Using mathematical models and data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the researchers estimated that sticking with standard time all year would prevent about 300,000 strokes annually and lead to 2.6 million fewer people with obesity nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key reason our seasonal time shifts are so damaging is how they impact our circadian rhythms, the internal clocks that regulate most body processes and are vital to a functioning immune system and sleep cycle. Out-of-whack circadian rhythms are linked to a wide range of health issues, including stroke and obesity. One way circadian rhythms get scrambled is by being exposed to light at the wrong time: morning light can help body clocks stay synchronized, while evening light can slow them down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md:pt16 md:sy16 md:bb md:bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class="vh y0 mb0 md:vv md:y100 md:mb16"&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="NTV7ARD" data-large-id="Inline-2" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think the best analogy is that your circadian clock is acting in the body like a conductor acts in an orchestra,” Zeitzer said. “With a weak conductor, it might still sound fine in the violin section or the flute section, but the audience hears a cacophony. And that’s what happens in the body, too, with everything just a little bit off.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists looked at the three possible time policies based on how they affect light exposure and impact circadian rhythms and overall health throughout the year. They found permanent standard time was best overall, permanent daylight saving time was second, and our current practice of switching back and forth was the absolute worst. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings varied a bit based on region and between night owls and morning larks. Those who like to stay up later (you know who you are) bear the greater negative health effects of the seasonal time switching. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-1" data-large-id="Inline-3" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/657584/half-daylight-saving-time-sunsetted.aspx" data-link="native" class=""&gt;widespread dislike&lt;/a&gt; for the more-than-&lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Daylight-Saving-Time" data-link="native" class=""&gt;century&lt;/a&gt;-old institution of daylight saving time, the best alternative option remains up for &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/does-daylight-saving-time-make-sense-scientists-debate-pros-and-cons" data-link="native" class=""&gt;debate&lt;/a&gt;. Health organizations like the &lt;a href="https://aasm.org/" data-link="native" class=""&gt;American Academy of Sleep Medicine&lt;/a&gt; support standard time, in favor of more morning light. Meanwhile, bills proposing permanent daylight saving time, which means more evening light, &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/139" data-link="native" class=""&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt; Congress nearly every year, but have yet to pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The way they modeled this study is genius,” said Joanna Fong-Isariyawongse, a neurologist at the University of Pittsburgh who focuses on sleep medicine but wasn’t involved in the study. “We know that we should end the twice-yearly shifts, but there’s this argument about which way we should go.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Just days before vaccine advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention meet to weigh who should get COVID vaccines this season, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has selected five more members to the committee he purged of Biden administration appointees in June. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new members of the influential Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices are:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;ul class="edTag rte2-style-ul"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hilary Blackburn, a pharmacist at AscensionRx, who also hosts a podcast, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dr. Kirk Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist and an affiliate of the &lt;a href="https://imahealth.org/dr-kirk-milhoan-acip/" target="_blank"&gt;Independent Medical Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dr. Evelyn Griffin, an ob/gyn and functional medicine practitioner, &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dr. Raymond Pollak, a semi-retired transplant surgeon, and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Catherine Stein, an epidemiology professor at Case Western Reserve University, &lt;a href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2021/02/22/shes-a-public-health-professor-by-day-a-covid-19-truther-by-night/" target="_blank"&gt;who has claimed&lt;/a&gt; the government overstated COVID risks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"The new ACIP members bring a wealth of real-world public health experience to the job of making immunization recommendations," said &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-cdc-announce-new-acip-members-sept-2025.html" target="_blank"&gt;Jim O'Neill&lt;/a&gt;, Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services and Acting Director of the CDC in a media statement. "We are grateful for their service in helping restore the public confidence in vaccines that was lost during the Biden era."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The advisory group – now numbering 12 members – makes recommendations that help determine which vaccines are offered free through the Vaccines for Children program, and what health insurers typically cover. They also influence state and local laws around vaccine requirements.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The appointments expand the committee just before it meets this week in Atlanta. On Thursday and Friday, the members will be &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/agendas.html" target="_blank"&gt;considering policies such as&lt;/a&gt; who should get the fall COVID-19 booster shot, and whether all babies should get the hepatitis B vaccine at birth.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Short list of members leaked in early September &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new members were among seven that appeared on a list that was first reported by the &lt;a href="https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/breaking-rfk-jr-seeks-to-rush-7-new" target="_blank"&gt;"Inside Medicine" newsletter&lt;/a&gt; on Sept. 3. Two others who were named then — Dr. Joseph Fraiman, an emergency medical physician, and Dr. John Gaitanis, a pediatric neurologist at Hasbro Children's Hospital in Rhode Island — were not appointed to the committee by HHS.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;NPR reached out to each of the new members of the committee earlier this month, when their names first appeared in media reports. Only one responded.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Raymond Pollak, a semi-retired transplant surgeon, was still in the midst of the vetting process on Sept. 5. "I think I'd be an ideal choice for a committee like this," he told NPR. "I have expertise in clinical trial management and ethics, and my background in transplant biology allows me to understand the science of what is being proposed."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pollak says he had not paid much attention to ACIP before he joined the committee, but he sees having non-vaccine experts on the panel as a plus. "I think it's a value to have broad representation of the community at large, both with and without the necessary expertise in order to formulate policy that makes sense to everybody," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And while Pollack considers COVID vaccines "safe to administer and provided a benefit in that it kept down the severity of the illness and prevented hospitalization," he says the vaccine rollout was "poorly managed," contributing to hysteria and conspiracy theories that the government covered up harms and injuries related to the vaccine. "The notion that the government tried to 'cover it up' is false," Pollak says. "All of the information on adverse effects is readily available in the medical literature. The problem is it tends to stay within the profession and doesn't get disseminated widely amongst the public."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Kennedy's imprint on vaccine panel grows&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The new members join the seven others Kennedy named to the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/25/nx-s1-5438482/cdc-vaccine-committee-acip-meeting-rfk" target="_blank"&gt;panel in June&lt;/a&gt;, replacements he handpicked after firing all 17 of the panel's previously seated members. The replacements, who &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/26/nx-s1-5438485/cdc-acip-rfk-thimerosal-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;met for the first time&lt;/a&gt; at the CDC in June, include Dr. Robert Malone, who has spread misinformation about COVID and &lt;a href="https://www.malone.news/p/patient-rights-are-not-a-scientific" target="_blank"&gt;opposed vaccine mandates&lt;/a&gt;, and Retsef Levi, an MIT professor of operations management who gained prominence during the pandemic for criticizing COVID vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The members Kennedy fired had been chosen for their medical expertise and understanding of vaccine policy, and had been formally vetted to ensure that they &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/11/nx-s1-5323771/rfk-jr-vaccine-advisers-conflicts-interest" target="_blank"&gt;would not directly financially benefit&lt;/a&gt; from any ACIP votes. They had been serving in overlapping rotations over several years to ensure continuity of expertise and process.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"There are large gaps in the new ACIP's composition in terms of their missing expertise on vaccinology, their missing expertise on primary care, their missing expertise on cost effectiveness and clinical trials," says Noel Brewer, a former ACIP member who had served on the committee for a year before being dismissed by Kennedy in June. "These are folks who fundamentally do not understand vaccines in a deep way. I wouldn't take medical advice from them, and I certainly don't think they should be setting policy for the United States."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since Kennedy overhauled the panel, the ACIP has seen major changes to how it operates, for instance voting to effectively ban flu vaccines with the mercury-containing preservative thimerosal &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/thimerosal-mercury-removed-from-us-flu-vaccines-acip.html" target="_blank"&gt;in their June meeting&lt;/a&gt;. The change was based on debunked claims without new scientific evidence of harms. This move, among others, has led top medical organizations and public health groups to question the integrity of the group's advice.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Misinformation, politicization of commonsense public health efforts, and sudden changes to federal vaccine guidance is creating mass confusion and diminishing trust in public health. As we head into another fall season sure to be marked by cases of flu, Covid-19, and RSV as well as the alarming reappearance of measles and pertussis, the stakes could not be higher," the presidents of five professional medical groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Physicians wrote, in a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/26/vaccine-policy-us-aafp-aap-acp-acog-idsa-presidents/" target="_blank"&gt;June op-ed in Stat News&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many state vaccine laws are tied to ACIP guidance. Some states led by Democratic governors are starting to reduce their reliance on the committee over concerns that future recommendations may be based on &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/06/nx-s1-5532121/states-vaccine-guidance-washington-oregon-new-mexico" target="_blank"&gt;"ideology and not science,"&lt;/a&gt; says Dennis Worsham, health secretary for the Washington State Department of Health, which has formed a vaccine policy alliance with California, Oregon and Hawaii.&lt;/p&gt;

            Chagas disease, known as the “kissing bug” disease, has long been thought of as a neglected tropical illness, but some researchers now argue it’s endemic to the United States. But a lack of awareness means it’s undercounted, undertreated and under-researched. What do you want to know about Chagas or other diseases spread by bugs in the United States?

                                        &lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (AP) — Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new vaccine advisory committee meets this week, with votes expected on whether to change recommendations on shots against COVID-19, hepatitis B and chickenpox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact questions to be voted on Thursday and Friday in Atlanta are unclear. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to questions seeking details to a newly posted &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-09-12-508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;agenda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, although the department announced five additional appointments to the committee on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some public health experts are worried that the votes will — at a minimum — raise unwarranted new questions about vaccines in the minds of parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps even more consequential would be a vote that restricts a government program from paying for vaccines for low-income families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m tightening my seat belt,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University vaccines expert.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, makes recommendations to the director of the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-director-susan-monarez-50dfbec849b53b4593755d2e6e616687"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; on how already-approved vaccines should be used. CDC directors have almost always accepted those recommendations, which are widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, a leading antivaccine activist before becoming the nation’s top health official, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/kennedy-cdc-acip-vaccines-3790c89f45b6314c5c7b686db0e3a8f9"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; the entire 17-member panel earlier this year and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-vaccine-committee-9f58e1f004075b081718ff078de88d76"&gt;replaced it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; with a group that includes several anti-vaccine voices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a look at the three vaccines being discussed:&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;h2&gt;COVID-19&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Kennedy was health secretary, ACIP would typically vote in June to reaffirm recommendations for shots against respiratory viruses that sicken millions of Americans each fall and winter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This past June, Kennedy’s ACIP voted to &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/cdc-acip-flu-vaccine-thimerosal-c5696bbc19f345323153d5336cb5e798"&gt;recommend flu shots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for Americans but was silent on COVID-19 shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before that meeting, Kennedy &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-70c358cad726e57d680234c3ecdec926"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; he was removing COVID-19 shots from the CDC’s recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women. The move was heavily criticized by doctors’ groups and public health organizations, and prompted a &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/lawsuit-vaccines-kennedy-95a1aa23c3f015f7a35a570f5ef8da36"&gt;lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Days after Kennedy’s announcement, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccines-cdc-kennedy-fd6ab0c7303a4a1698b319885a02ef54"&gt;CDC officials said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; families could still get the 2024-2025 version of COVID-19 shots for their kids in consultation with their doctors. That clarification meant shots would still be covered by the federal government’s Vaccines For Children program, which pays for shots for families who lack money or adequate health insurance coverage. It’s now responsible for roughly half of childhood vaccinations in the U.S. each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with flu shots, however, there are new COVID-19 formulations each fall, to account for changes in which strains are circulating. The committee has not yet voted on whether to recommend this season’s COVID-19 shots or whether those shots should be covered by the VFC program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further complicating the picture: When the FDA last month &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-covid-shots-fda-kennedy-pfizer-children-9ce19908ae7afb354732aa162fd28532"&gt;licensed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; this fall’s COVID-19 shots, the agency took the unusual step of narrowing their use for healthy younger adults and &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://apnews.com/article/covid-vaccine-kids-what-to-know-5ddb5e3e92b12a6f5044dc229e19590d"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;If the ACIP simply follows that, and if there is no additional clarifying language from the CDC, then “that would take away access for roughly half of America’s kids,” said Dr. Sean O’Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pediatricians group urges that vaccinations continue for all children ages 6 months to 2 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Hepatitis B&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B can cause serious liver infections. In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles during use injection-drug use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the virus also can be passed to a baby from an infected mother, and as many as 90% of infected infants go on to have chronic infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hepatitis B vaccine was first licensed in the U.S. in 1981. In 1991, the ACIP recommended a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds (2 kilograms).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infant vaccinations are stressed for women who have hepatitis B or, crucially, who have not been tested for it. The infant shots are 85% to 95% effective in preventing chronic hepatitis B infections, studies have shown.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Newborn hepatitis B vaccinations are considered a success, and no recent peer-reviewed research shows any safety problem with giving kids the shots on their first day of life, Schaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kennedy’s ACIP members suggested in June they wanted to revisit the guidance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schaffner noted that health officials used to rely on screening mothers before birth but that many cases were missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There were lots of failures,” he said. “And so there were continuing transmissions from mother to child.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;MMRV&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chickenpox was once a common childhood annoyance, causing an itchy skin rash and fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the highly contagious virus can also lead to complications such as skin infections, swelling of the brain and pneumonia. Severe cases are more common among teens and adults who get it for the first time. The virus — called varicella — also can reactivate later in life and cause the painful illness called shingles.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The government first recommended that all children get a chickenpox vaccine in 1995, leading to a dramatic drop in cases and deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, a combination MMRV shot — measles, mumps, rubella and varicella — was licensed. The CDC initially recommended that doctors and parents use the combo shot over separate MMR and varicella injections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But within a few years, studies showed children who got the combo shot more often developed a rash, fever and — in rare instances — seizures after vaccination compared with children who got separate shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, the ACIP &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5903a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;changed its recommendation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, removing the preferential language and saying either the combination shot or separate shots were acceptable for the first dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, most pediatricians suggest separate doses for the first shot, but give the combined shot for the second dose, pediatrics experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, there’s no new evidence about harms from MMRV shots, said O’Leary, of AAP. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why revisit it now? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This version of the ACIP is an orchestrated effort to sow distrust in vaccines,” O’Leary said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;HHS announces new committee members&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, HHS officials on Monday announced five new committee members — bringing the roster to 12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new members are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Hilary Blackburn, a pharmacist and podcaster who HHS officials said is director of medication access and affordability for AscensionRx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Dr. Evelyn Griffin, an obstetrician and gynecologist based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Dr. Kirk Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist who with his wife operates a medical missionary organization called For Hearts and Souls. He appeared at a 2024 congressional &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-p0kFdcVkA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;hearing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; at which he said an increase in cardiovascular disease in older teens and young adults should be attributed to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Dr. Raymond Pollak, a transplant specialist based in Skokie, Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Catherine Stein, a Case Western Reserve University disease researcher. During the COVID-19 pandemic, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/20484834-stein-hb-624-testimony" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;she worked with&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; an Ohio anti-vaccine group and argued that case counts were inaccurate and that the coronavirus was not as dangerous as health officials portrayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

    Dr. Jamin Brahmbhatt is a urologist and robotic surgeon with Orlando Health and an assistant professor at the University of Central Florida’s College of Medicine.
&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfgzhcmg003q2cq9a34m10vz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The day after I had kidney stone surgery, I suddenly couldn’t pee. My bladder felt full, but nothing was coming out. I’m a urologist and even I was freaking out: I felt stuck, panicked and helpless. After what felt like five hours — but was really only five minutes — the urine started to flow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa00013b6n9i68fn1b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Once I remembered I’m a urologist, I realized the problem wasn’t just my bladder. The problem was constipation from all the medications I had to take the day before surgery. Once that issue was sorted out, my bladder finally relaxed — and the urine flowed just fine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa00023b6n86qgvsok@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            My case was situational and temporary, and it could be for you, too. But for many people, difficulty urinating is a real quality-of-life issue that won’t go away easily.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa00033b6nak46n64s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The problem could be urinary retention, when your bladder is full but can’t empty. Or your bladder may be empty but you still feel the urge to go. Either way, the experience is the same — you’re trying to pee and nothing’s coming out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa00043b6nai5zz60c@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To understand why, I’ll go over some basic anatomy. Made of muscle fibers, the &lt;a href="https://training.seer.cancer.gov/anatomy/urinary/components/bladder.html" target="_blank"&gt;bladder&lt;/a&gt; is a balloon-like structure in the lower abdomen that holds urine. At the bottom is a narrow region called the bladder neck, which opens into the urethra – the tube that carries urine out of the body. In men, the urethra runs through the prostate before reaching the penis; in women, it’s shorter and exits just in front of the vagina.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa00053b6ngjolzwpv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For urine to flow, the bladder muscle must contract or squeeze while the outlet and urethra relax. If anything interferes with this process — a blockage, weak bladder muscles or poor nerve signals — the urine is unable to flow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa00063b6n0e9ab4c3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This issue is most common in men older than 50, but women and younger people can experience it too, especially if medications or other health conditions are involved.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa00073b6n7bke75eq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In men, the most common cause is an enlarged prostate blocking the flow of urine. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/urologic-diseases/urinary-retention/definition-facts" target="_blank"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt; that after age 70, about 1 in 10 men will have developed acute urinary retention within five years, and by the time they reach their 80s, that number rises to nearly 1 in 3.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa00083b6nzbt0jbgb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In women, nerve issues or a cystocele (a type of pelvic organ prolapse, or dropped bladder) can alter flow, but acute urinary retention is much less common, affecting only about 3 in 100,000 women each year.  Sorry, guys, this problem is more common in you, thanks to the prostate and longer urethra!
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa00093b6na36fdkko@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is not just a condition of being old. Many cases, like mine, come down to something more everyday: constipation. When the bowels back up, they can physically change the angle of the bladder neck, essentially kinking the outlet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa000a3b6ng9lh02g4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Medications are another significant factor. Think about the pills you might take for allergies or a cold — decongestants and antihistamines are known to slow or even stop urine flow. Some antidepressants, bladder medications and pain pills can have the same effect.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa000b3b6nyz6hozh9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other causes may include urinary stones, strictures, blood clots and infections that can block the outlet. For those with a neurologic condition such as multiple sclerosis, diabetes, a spinal cord injury or stroke, the nerves that control bladder emptying can be damaged.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa000c3b6n8fwtxohm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Not all trouble urinating looks the same. A weak stream or stop-and-start flow is one thing — bothersome, but often gradual and not immediately dangerous.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa000d3b6nslhpximv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you cannot urinate at all and your bladder feels painfully full, your belly feels swollen, you’ve tried to relax, you’ve had a bowel movement and still nothing comes out — that’s likely an emergency. Go to the ER right away. You may need to have your bladder drained with a catheter to relieve the pressure, empty your bladder and prevent kidney damage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa000e3b6n5z9lzfp7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some people have no symptoms at all. In our urology office, we’ll do an ultrasound scan of the bladder and find hundreds of milliliters of urine still inside. This “silent” retention can be just as risky over time, leading to infections or long-term bladder problems if left untreated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa000f3b6n0wn3n15z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In one &lt;a href="https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=68293" target="_blank"&gt;hospital-based study&lt;/a&gt; of male patients, approximately half presented with acute retention, while about 30% were found to have chronic retention. That’s why it’s important to have routine checkups with your primary care doctor and tell them about any symptoms you may have — sometimes your bladder can be in trouble even if you feel fine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa000g3b6nc55xtu82@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The first step is determining whether the issue is proper retention — your bladder is full but can’t empty — or simply having the sensation that you need to go but your bladder is already empty. Those two situations may seem the same, but the treatment is quite different. That’s why we review your medical history and get new, objective data. For example, we check how much urine is left in the bladder after you try to void, test urine and blood for infections, and look at kidney function.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa000h3b6n7zk0vj0y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            We also have tools that eliminate some of the guesswork. A uroflow machine can measure the strength and pattern of your urine stream. And, if needed, we can put a small camera (cystoscopy) into the urethra and bladder to see what might be blocking the flow.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Just this week, I saw a young man who was having significant trouble urinating — rare for his age. A quick look with the scope showed a urethral stricture, or scar tissue, that was obstructing the flow of urine. As urologists, we see similar issues all the time: Sometimes it’s scar tissue, other times a large prostate pressing on the urethra. In women it could be a dropped bladder. Different causes, same results — urinary flow is blocked, and the bladder cannot empty properly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa000j3b6nh917oy11@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In rare, acute cases — when someone is in severe pain and unable to urinate at all — we immediately insert a catheter to drain the bladder. More commonly, however, patients have minor, bothersome symptoms that creep up over time. When caught early, many of these problems can be improved or even fixed before they turn into emergencies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa000k3b6nxdel26ax@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pay attention to subtle changes, such as a weaker stream, straining or frequent nighttime trips to the bathroom. Don’t brush these off as just getting older. Review your medication list with your doctor and stay hydrated. Most importantly, don’t ignore constipation — it doesn’t just affect your gut; it can affect your urination, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa000l3b6nueaeukcj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Keep an eye on your bathroom habits the way you would your blood pressure or weight. Small changes addressed early can make a big difference.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa000m3b6n24of7aaq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Talking about not being able to pee can feel embarrassing or awkward, but it’s important that you tell your doctor if it’s happening to you. After all, having this problem is your body’s way of asking for help. I know firsthand how unsettling it can be since I went through it myself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa000n3b6nbrfpt58o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In my case, the cause was straightforward, and the symptoms cleared up quickly. In other cases, the cause may be more complex. This is when a doctor can help determine whether the issue is a blockage, a nerve problem, a side effect of medication or something else entirely. Whether the fix is as simple as changing a medication or as involved as having a medical procedure to open the prostate channel, getting checked early makes all the difference.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfhalfqa000o3b6nlzcxcruq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s why I shared my story — it was embarrassing even for me, but I hope it will help you avoid the same issue. Don’t ignore the symptoms if you have them. Just get checked.
    &lt;/p&gt;

This leads to a build-up of fat in the bloodstream and liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Such imbalances in the gut microbiome are linked to serious chronic conditions. Type 2 &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/diabetes/index.html" id="mol-5b1638a0-924f-11f0-9d30-d52ef5490f75"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14707027/silent-condition-raises-early-colon-cancer-risk-nafld.html"&gt; fatty liver disease&lt;/a&gt; affect roughly 38 million and 83 million Americans, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a healthy gut, small amounts of D-lactate are not harmful. However, diets high in processed foods, sugars, and fats can promote overgrowth of bacteria that produce the molecule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;D-lactate travels to the liver, forcing it to overproduce glucose and fat while sparking inflammation. This stress on the liver can cause steatosis, an early stage of liver disease that may lead to scarring over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To counter this, the researchers developed a biodegradable polymer 'trap' that captures D-lactate in the intestines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In experiments with obese mice fed a diet containing the polymer, the trap improved &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13825531/young-diabetes-heart-disease-study.html"&gt;blood sugar control&lt;/a&gt;, insulin response, and liver health, all without changing diet or body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings suggested the approach could serve as a stand-alone or complementary therapy for metabolic diseases, offering a potential breakthrough in the fight against type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Approximately 38 million Americans have type 2 diabetes. The latest research points to a potential new treatment that could intercept the disease in the gut by targeting a harmful molecule produced by the body's own gut bacteria&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Obese mice, as well as people with obesity, naturally have higher levels of the lesser-known D-lactate in their blood, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They discovered that the gut microbiome was the source. Most of the D-lactate comes from gut microbes and was shown to raise blood sugar and liver fat more aggressively, unlike the more familiar L-lactate made by muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jonathan Schertzer, senior and corresponding author and professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences at McMaster University, said: 'This is a new twist on a classic metabolic pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We've known for nearly a century that muscles and the liver exchange lactate and glucose - a process called the Cori cycle. What we've discovered is a new branch of that cycle, where gut bacteria are also part of the conversation.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To test its effects, they gave mice a potent oral dose of D-lactate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their livers went into overdrive, producing more blood sugar and fat than ever before, confirming to scientists that D-lactate was not a harmless marker, but rather a powerful compound fuel that drives disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They aimed to create a safe polymer that would not be absorbed into the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their polymer trap was a compound mixed in with the food given to the mice. When the mice ate the mixture, the polymer compound traveled to their intestines undigested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows estimates for global diabetes cases. It is predicted that the number of people with the condition will more than double by the year 2050 compared to 2021&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As gut bacteria produced D-lactate, the polymer acted like a magnet, binding to the D-lactate molecules and forming a stable complex, which was too large to be absorbed through the gut wall into the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Essentially, the D-lactate was trapped in a form that the body could not take in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead of being absorbed, the entire complex continued moving through the digestive system and was excreted in the feces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mice eating the polymer-enriched diet had significantly higher levels of D-lactate in their feces, proving to researchers that the polymer was binding to D-lactate in the gut and preventing its absorption, forcing it to be excreted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also had lower levels of D-lactate in their blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were no changes in L-lactate absorption levels, though. Researchers did not find any changes to levels in the mice's blood or fecal matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their research offers a promising pathway to treat obesity-related conditions like type 2 diabetes and metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MASLD) at its source, the gut-liver axis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their approach, using a safe, biodegradable polymer compound, could lead to novel therapies that lower blood sugar, reduce liver fat, and combat inflammation without requiring changes in diet or body weight, representing a major shift from managing symptoms to intercepting the root cause of metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The obesity rate among American adults increased from 21.2 percent in 1990 to 43.8 percent in 2022 for women and 16.9 percent to 41.6 percent for men&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their research was published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(25)00328-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1550413125003286%3Fshowall%3Dtrue"&gt;Cell Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jonathan Schertzer, a co-author and a member of the Centre for Metabolism, Obesity, and Diabetes Research (MODR) at McMaster, said: 'This is a completely new way to think about treating metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Instead of targeting hormones or the liver directly, we're intercepting a microbial fuel source before it can do harm.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 16:20:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAFBVV95cUxNemlBcGJxQ001djZWZ2NUWDhoQ3ZIY3ZSdFUxVU9RWVNrNl8xNmxWT1hzdWN4TnJJQTdIT2s4eUJUcm5BQ3REbzdkQ2IyYVlleXVOUGd0b0xHeUtWeWNkUzI1ZXhNb1MxOUFIZ1VQTTFoS185MmZCa002NzdzbGZDa3loc2xRMTNGSXlVVzQ3dmd3cFhobThEa242ekRVOEN10gGmAUFVX3lxTE9XYlU1N3JPYW9PaVE4YkQxR2tvNnVCMjdlal9jWjJwQTRQdXl3dTZvd282amtIeHZHVFktZ0tOWThYYkRJaUJicmZhd1dzMG1RVV92QU9XY1JtejVjbkRIY1pVel9YVlBNak53WHdraWh5T2FsVWpLREVJUUZ5M0IwOGl1SWwwWHZiUzEtTHF2ZldsZVhPcndpVjdQN2x0el9GZG1tVmc</guid></item><item><title>滑板车事故让母亲的“大脑从头脑中脱颖而出” -每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15093727/mom-dead-brain-hanging-head.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/illinois/index.html" id="mol-6b6a3b50-9021-11f0-b873-a1b9191d5971"&gt;Illinois&lt;/a&gt; mom 'came back from the dead' after an &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/e-scooters/index.html" id="mol-6b61fdf0-9021-11f0-b873-a1b9191d5971"&gt;e-scooter&lt;/a&gt; accident left her brain 'hanging out of' her head.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Savanah White, 28, and her seven-year-old son Malakye were crossing an intersection on July 24, 2024, when a car &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14376849/warning-burns-exploding-e-scooters.html"&gt;knocked them off their e-scooter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;White smashed her face on the ground, breaking 26 bones and leaving part of her brain sticking out from her forehead.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The injury left her 'clinically dead' after her heart stopped for more than a minute due to a lack of oxygen to the brain and the brain being unable to send signals to her heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At one point, a chaplain was called in to deliver last rites and discuss funeral arrangements with White's family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking about the accident, White said: 'We were going back home to my apartment, but first we were stopping at a gas station across the street to get ice cream. But we never made it across the street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was pulling out of the intersection, and a red car was speeding straight through. I... grabbed my son. We flew about 25 feet in the air, [then] hit the concrete.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Local reports at the time said police were investigating and looking for suspects. The Daily Mail was unable to secure further updates on the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Savanah White, 28, and her son were knocked off their e-scooter in July 2024. The accident left part of her brain hanging out of her head&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;White is pictured here after the accident. She was clinically dead for over a minute and broke 26 bones in her face&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I lost consciousness because part of my brain had actually come out of my forehead. I was clinically dead for a minute and 24 seconds.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also suffered a broken pelvis, a collapsed lung, two strokes and an aneurysm, which is a bulge in the weak area of a blood vessel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While harmless on their own, aneurysms can rupture and cause potentially fatal bleeding in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was hospitalized for three weeks as a result of her collective injuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is unclear whether White or her son were wearing a helmet while riding the e-scooter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Everything was so bad and I was so mangled up, they didn't know if I would make it to the surgeries or not,' White said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'After a couple of days, I was stable enough to have surgery - but I didn't properly wake up for six days.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors took extra skin from White's C-section scar and stitched it to her forehead - a procedure known as a skin graft. They implanted metal plates into her face to hold the 26 broken bones together.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Malakye, now eight, was hospitalized with a broken leg and required two head surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After White regained consciousness, she was in denial about everything that had happened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I woke up on the hospital floor. The security guard stated that I had been trying to escape the hospital. I didn't think I got hit. I kept ripping my trach [tracheostomy tube] out and trying to leave to get back to my kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They said, 'You're in the hospital. You got hit by a car.' I said, 'No, I'm not, no, I didn't.' They finally gave me a mirror and I looked at my face and I thought, 'Oh my god, I did.''&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured above is a scan of White's broken facial bones after the accident&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;White and her son Malakye (pictured) have both made a full recovery, though White still suffers from PTSD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over a year later, both mother and son have recovered, and only a small 'Harry Potter' scar remains on White's forehead.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the accident left her with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and the damage in her facial bones means she will be 'unable to smell anything ever again' as severe injuries can block nasal passages and damage olfactory nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;White said she is still 'terrified of driving' and struggles to cope with the stress by herself.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, she also said the ordeal gave her a new perspective and appreciation for life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'&lt;span&gt;[While unconscious], I went through a rainbow tunnel, and I saw colors and lights that don't even exist here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I saw everything: the Earth, heaven, hell, all dimensions.

We also know that people that have periodontal disease typically have markers of inflammation," said Freeman, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does that connect to chronic disease? Inflammation can cause vascular disease — the narrowing, weakening or even blockage of blood vessels — that can damage organs such as the kidneys, lungs, liver and of course the brain. Vascular dementia is the second most common form of cognitive deterioration after Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation also riles up the immune system, which can spiral out of control and attack the heart and other organs. Chronic inflammation also promotes insulin resistance and cellular dysfunction that can lead to type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease, a growing concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It certainly makes sense that if you are eating a very clean, predominantly plant-based diet such as the Mediterranean diet, inflammation is down," Freeman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But this can't be the American version of the Mediterranean diet — the one with tons of lamb and feta cheese," he added. "This has to be the real deal — a true plant-first diet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the Mediterranean diet?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have found the award-winning &lt;a href="https://www.ksl.com/article/50550090" rel="follow" target="_blank"&gt;Mediterranean diet &lt;/a&gt;can reduce the risk for diabetes, high cholesterol, dementia, memory loss, depression and breast cancer. The diet, which is more of an eating style than a restricted diet, has also been linked to stronger bones and a healthier heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The diet features simple, plant-based cooking, with the majority of each meal focused on fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans and seeds, with a few nuts and a heavy emphasis on extra-virgin olive oil. Fats other than olive oil, such as butter, are consumed rarely, if at all, and sugar and refined foods are reserved for special occasions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;This can't be the American version of the Mediterranean diet — the one with tons of lamb and feta cheese. This has to be the real deal — a true plant-first diet.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Dr. Andrew Freeman, National Jewish Health in Denver&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red meat is used sparingly, usually only to flavor a dish. Eating healthy, oily fish, which are packed with omega-3 fatty acids, is encouraged, while eggs, dairy and poultry are eaten in much smaller portions than in the traditional Western diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social interactions during meals and exercise are basic cornerstones of the Mediterranean style of eating. Lifestyle changes that are part of the diet include eating with friends and family, socializing over meals, mindfully eating favorite foods, as well as mindful movement and exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Higher intake of red meat also linked to risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/jper.70016" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;published Monday&lt;/a&gt; in the Journal of Periodontology, included 200 study participants in the United Kingdom. Scientists performed dental exams and took blood samples — participants also filled out dietary questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Low adherence to Mediterranean diet and higher red meat consumption were associated with severity of periodontal disease," said senior study author Luigi Nibali, a dentist and professor of periodontology at King's College London in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that the people who ate more red meat and did not follow the Mediterranean diet had higher levels of circulating inflammatory markers, such as interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These markers increase in the presence of trauma or inflammation anywhere in the body. However, sometimes there is an exaggerated response which can lead to more gum disease. Higher levels of these markers mean more inflammation," Nibali said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Higher consumption of vegetables, legumes and dairy products were correlated with lower inflammatory marker C-reactive protein, so they seem to be helpful. There were some beneficial trends also for fruit and olive oil," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, prior research has shown that chewing green leafy and cruciferous vegetables, root vegetables, apples, and citrus fruit — all key parts of the Mediterranean diet — can promote healthy teeth and gums. These beneficial foods provide "nutrients and a salivary response that improves bacterial health, which then improves overall inflammation," Freeman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study's finding are not surprising, Freeman said, "it's certainly a good reminder to pay attention to your teeth. And then if you eat a diet that is more in line with the health of the body, everything seems to be better, including your teeth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;The narrative around aging needs an update. While culture paints the 70s as decline, mounting research reveals something different: people who reach this milestone with the right practices often report it as their happiest time. They're not defying aging—they're doing it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference isn't luck or genetics. It's habits. Small, consistent choices that compound over decades, creating what scientists call &lt;a href="https://www.brightfocus.org/resource/healthy-aging-and-cognitive-reserve/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cognitive reserve&lt;/a&gt;—essentially a buffer against age-related changes. These aren't extreme measures. They're deceptively simple daily practices anyone can adopt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They treat learning like daily vitamins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People thriving in their 70s never stop being students. They tackle unfamiliar subjects with freshman enthusiasm—languages, instruments, topics they never had time for. This isn't busywork; it's brain architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31732015/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; shows challenging your brain with novel learning creates neural pathways even late in life. The brain remains plastic, forming connections and compensating for changes. Those who keep learning don't just maintain—they improve. The key is genuine challenge. Crosswords don't count after 30 years. It's struggling with something truly new that builds resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They prioritize people over everything&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The healthiest 70-somethings understand what &lt;a href="https://longevity.stanford.edu/lifestyle/2023/12/18/how-social-connection-supports-longevity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;longevity research&lt;/a&gt; confirms: relationships are medicine. They invest in friendships like others invest in portfolios. They show up—coffee dates, phone calls, groups, volunteering. Not from obligation, but because connection is survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strong social ties increase longevity by 50 percent—rivaling the benefits of quitting smoking. The mechanism is both psychological and physiological: connection reduces inflammation, lowers stress hormones, strengthens immunity. But quality beats quantity. Deep connections trump superficial dozens. Thriving 70-year-olds curate their circles, keeping relationships that energize, not drain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They move without calling it exercise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch someone aging well—you'll see constant, gentle movement. Not gym sessions. Just movement woven through life. Gardening, walking for coffee, taking stairs, kitchen dancing. They've discovered what Blue Zone researchers observe: the healthiest populations don't exercise; they never stop moving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Movement increases brain blood flow, promotes cell growth, enhances neural connections. Those who thrive don't treat movement as punishment. They've made it inevitable, enjoyable, joyful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They guard sleep like gold&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While younger people weaponize exhaustion, those excelling in their 70s know better. They maintain sleep schedules with religious precision. Bedtime isn't negotiable. Wake time doesn't vary. They've engineered environments that honor sleep's role in brain maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quality sleep clears metabolic waste from the brain, consolidates memories, supports cognitive reserve. The thriving don't sleep well by accident. They've created it—blackout curtains, cool temperatures, evening screen limits, unwavering consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They engage with purpose, not busyness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retirement isn't retreat for those living their best 70s. They contribute meaningfully—mentoring, volunteering, creating, teaching. This isn't staying busy; it's staying necessary. They need to feel needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prb.org/resources/todays-research-on-aging-44-more-than-a-feeling-how-social-connection-protects-health-in-later-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Social engagement research&lt;/a&gt; links purpose in later life with better health, cognition, and longevity. Purpose drives healthy habits and connections while influencing stress and inflammation cellularly. The key: authentic engagement aligned with values, utilizing accumulated wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. They master the art of letting go&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the secret of successful aging: strategic abandonment. People thriving at 70 have become ruthless life editors. They've stopped maintaining everything and everyone. They pour energy into what matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach means fewer goals, greater intensity. Give up night driving, become the morning's most reliable volunteer. Stop remembering everything, start writing everything. Recognize limits as opportunities to redirect energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those living their best 70s aren't following complex formulas. No biohacking, exotic supplements, or extreme regimens. Just simple things done consistently: learning, connecting, moving, sleeping, contributing, choosing wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These habits interconnect beautifully. Social connection motivates movement. Movement improves sleep. Sleep enhances learning. Learning provides purpose. Purpose strengthens bonds. It's not six habits—it's one integrated life approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive reserve science tells us your brain at 70 reflects decades of daily choices. But here's hope: it's never too late. The brain stays plastic. Relationships can strengthen. Purpose emerges at any age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe those thriving at 70 understand something profound: aging well isn't fighting time but using it wisely. The best decade isn't the youngest—it's when you finally know what matters and have wisdom to pursue it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“Anything that is polysyllabic and Latinate doesn’t sound threatening enough,” said &lt;a href="https://dept.atmos.ucla.edu/tcd/people/michael-ghil"&gt;Michael Ghil&lt;/a&gt;, a mathematician at the University of California, Los Angeles, who studies theoretical climate dynamics. “‘Tipping points’ does.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that there had been major shifts in the Earth’s climate was by then well established. Scientists had found &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.281.5381.1342"&gt;geological evidence&lt;/a&gt; that supported the Snowball Earth hypothesis. They’d seen hints that patterns in deep ocean currents had once looked very different. And six thousand years ago, they’d discovered, the Sahara Desert was a lush Eden. Only later did it reach a tipping point that transformed it into a sea of sand; today, hippopotamus bones lie buried beneath its dunes, a reminder of that bygone era. The history of Earth’s climate is full of such rapid, massive transitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="post__aside mb2 relative post__aside--right"&gt;&lt;figure class="mb2 mt1 image--shortcode s:mt-0"&gt;
    
            &lt;figcaption class="image__meta mt1"&gt;
                            &lt;div class="caption wysiwyg h5 theme__anchors--solid fill-h post__aside__caption post__aside__caption--shortcode"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Tim Lenton brought the language of tipping points into the world of climate science.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            
        &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what’s the right math to describe those changes? Scientists who study tipping points readily admit that the term can be somewhat vague. Sometimes it’s used loosely to describe any large, sudden change that arises from small perturbations. Other times it’s used in a more specific and technical way, to signify an irreversible bifurcation that has a rigorous mathematical definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the global climate is a much more complicated system than Peter Lake. The oceans and atmosphere are massive and, importantly, open, shaped by far-reaching forces that act on timescales ranging from hours to eons. The forcing of the system toward a bifurcation — caused by, say, a gradual buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere — is defined by myriad subtle and interconnected variables. These “dimensions,” as mathematicians call them, can affect one another in complicated feedback loops. Where do you even start?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With the climate, a load of people basically argue, ‘Oh, because it’s high-dimensional, you won’t get this simple, low-order bifurcation or tipping behavior,’” Lenton said. “They thought it couldn’t be that simple when you got into all the messy complexity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But physicists studying bifurcations had found that near or at the point of transition, the behavior of a complex system can simplify as it passes from one state to another. “Sometimes a high-dimensional system can tip,” said Lenton, “and when it gets near tipping, it starts to behave like a much lower-dimensional system.” The lesson, he added, echoes the one learned at Peter Lake: to “simplify without oversimplifying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, while bifurcations offer a helpful way to understand many past climatic changes, looking into the future presents new challenges. At Peter Lake, ecologists had the luxury of observation. Pay close enough attention to the water, and it’s possible to see attractors come and go, and to study their dynamics. Early warning signals become clear, in part, because the progression from a murky lake to a clear one is predictable under certain forcing conditions. But often, climate scientists can’t directly observe multiple states of the Earth. While they may have clues about where the climate is heading, they must also make many assumptions. This includes assumptions about the relationships between variables, about what a new equilibrium state might look like after a tipping point is reached, and about the nature of that tipping point — whether it’s caused by slowly adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, by a sudden change in the pace of carbon dioxide production, or by random, short-term perturbations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

This seems to disagree with findings from an earlier study, published &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33424809/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33424809/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in 2020&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which found the opposite effect — that targeting the virus inadvertently worsened the fungal infection. (Rocha noted that there could be several reasons for the divergent results, including the fact that each research team used different approaches to render their fungal strains virus-free.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/norman.vanrhijn" target="_blank" data-url="https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/norman.vanrhijn" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Norman van Rhijn&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a research fellow at the Manchester Fungal Infection Group, said the finding uncovered by Rocha and colleagues was completely novel. "This has been a big step towards understanding the virulence capacity of this fungus and has the potential to broaden these findings in other human pathogens," van Rhijn, who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="675edaaa-6ec6-4802-8433-e913f94d9a73"&gt;Rocha and her team found that the fungi exposed to antivirals reproduced less effectively and showed reduced melanin production; in many disease-causing fungi, melanin boosts virulence and the ability to survive in harsh environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus itself cannot harm mice or humans, since it needs specific receptors and proteins to bind to, and these are absent in the mammals, Rocha said. Each fungus-infecting virus is usually specific to one fungal species, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Like in the case of this one, it can only infect &lt;em&gt;Aspergillus fumigatus&lt;/em&gt;," Rocha said. "It's not able to infect other fungi."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers think one way the virus helps the fungus thrive is by controlling some of the processes by which the fungus processes &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-RNA.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-RNA.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;RNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a genetic molecule involved in making proteins. The virus somehow improves the fungus' stress responses and protein synthesis, thus strengthening survival in hostile conditions. They also saw that human immune cells found it harder to kill virus-infected strains of the fungus, compared with uninfected strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ef592843-3317-488b-86cb-42352caa6976"&gt;If the antivirals used to target AfuPmV-1M in the mice work as effectively in humans, future therapies could use the drug to weaken the fungus enough for the immune system or antifungal drugs to clear it from the body, the study authors think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rocha suspects other fungal pathogens that infect people may also be infected with similar viruses that boost their resilience. Together with her colleagues, she is investigating the infection mechanisms involved in infected and uninfected fungi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our article represents only the initial step of this investigation," she told Live Science. "Our broader goal is to provide a more comprehensive explanation of how the process unfolds at the molecular level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-JvqWSxkwxkTDoV6hdoEpTe-X47ZhHQh8Pg5xm25CIwbkxr3NiYP9Wrm" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-JvqWSxkwxkTDoV6hdoEpTe-X47ZhHQh8Pg5xm25CIwbkxr3NiYP9Wrm slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

That’s mostly true for older adults, but for younger folks under 65, especially women, heart attacks often have other causes that doctors haven’t paid enough attention to. This &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jacc.org/doi/10.1016/j.jacc.2025.07.012" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, looked at over 15 years of data from the Rochester Epidemiology Project and found some surprising patterns in what triggers heart attacks in these younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/being-too-thin-could-be-deadlier-than-being-overweight-research-shows/articleshow/123893319.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Being too thin could be deadlier than being overweight, research shows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/diet/are-bell-peppers-keto-friendly-nutrition-facts-you-should-know/articleshow/123891905.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Are bell peppers keto-friendly? Nutrition facts you should know&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;First up, the usual suspect, artery-clogging plaque (known as atherosclerosis), still causes most heart attacks overall. But here’s the kicker: while it was behind about 75% of heart attacks in men under 65, it only accounted for about 47% of those in women under 65. That means for women, more than half of their heart attacks come from different, less-known causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lesser known reasons of heart attack in young women&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those “hidden” causes is spontaneous coronary artery dissection, or SCAD. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is when a tear suddenly forms in a coronary artery, causing blood clots and blocking blood flow without any plaque buildup. SCAD is especially common in younger women who often seem healthy otherwise. What’s scary is that SCAD is often missed or mistaken for a typical heart attack caused by plaque, and if doctors treat it like a usual heart attack with stents or surgery, it can do more harm than good. This study found SCAD is nearly six times more common in women than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another nontraditional cause this study pointed out was heart attacks triggered by stressors like anemia or infections. These triggers appear to cause what you might call “stress heart attacks,” which were the second most common cause overall here, and they came with the highest death rates over five years, about 33%. That means people who had heart attacks triggered by things like severe infections actually had a tougher time surviving than those with classic heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/prediabetes-warning-5-morning-symptoms-that-could-be-the-first-sign/amp_etphotostory/123844943.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Prediabetes warning: 5 morning symptoms that could be the first sign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/how-many-glasses-of-water-should-you-drink-a-day-to-pass-kidney-stones-naturally/amp_articleshow/123879713.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;How Many Glasses Of Water Should You Drink A Day To Pass Kidney Stones Naturally?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also noted that “truly unexplained” heart attacks are very rare, less than 3% after doctors carefully reviewed cases. That’s good news because it means most heart attacks have identifiable reasons, which can help doctors tailor better treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does this all matter? Well, this research spotlights how critical it is to know the exact cause of a heart attack, not just treat the symptoms. When doctors misunderstand the root cause, treatments can be less effective or even risky. For example, someone with SCAD might receive a stent they don’t actually need, putting them at new risks. Understanding a heart attack’s real cause can guide safer and smarter care, and hopefully, prevent the attack from happening again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To wrap it up, here are the main takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heart attacks in younger adults, especially women, often have causes beyond clogged arteries.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SCAD is a common but under-recognized cause in younger women.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stress-related triggers like anemia or infection cause dangerous heart attacks with high death rates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Misdiagnosing the cause can lead to inappropriate treatments that might do more harm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Awareness and precise diagnosis are key to improving outcomes and recovery for younger heart attack patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study reminds us that not all heart attacks are the same. The more we learn about these hidden causes, the better we get at protecting people’s hearts—especially younger women who might not fit the usual heart attack mold. If something feels off, don’t hesitate to ask questions and push for answers.

It was a drug he had taken before, but what happened next was anything but routine: He had a severe reaction that caused burns all over his body, including on the surface of his eyes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chapman was in a coma for 27 days. He lost his left eye to an infection and lost most of his vision in the other. His body recovered, but his vision fully never returned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For the last 20 years, I’ve been having close to 50 surgeries trying to save this eye, most of them cornea transplants,” Chapman said of his right eye. “We would put a new cornea in. It would last sometimes just a few months or even up to years, but it would just kind of never heal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Dr. Greg Moloney, clinical associate professor of corneal surgery at the University of British Columbia, was able to restore Chapman’s sight this year with a rare procedure that involved implanting Chapman’s own tooth into his eye.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m very happy and am just taking in the world again, appreciating the little things. It’s been kind of surreal and kind of a euphoric feeling to it,” Chapman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The procedure, also known as tooth-in-eye or osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis, involves removing a patient’s tooth, sewing a piece of it into the cheek and placing the structure into their eye.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s considered a last resort.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s a situation where a standard corneal transplant simply won’t work,” said Dr. Vicente Diaz, assistant professor of ophthalmology and visual science at the Yale School of Medicine. Diaz was not involved with Chapman’s case but treats people who have Stevens-Johnson syndrome, the rare and sometimes fatal drug reaction that caused Chapman’s blindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The condition causes severe inflammation of the skin and mucous membranes, including the eyes. In some cases, Diaz said, the immune system attacks and destroys the limbal stem cells that are essential for keeping the cornea clear. Without these cells, corneal tissue becomes scarred and keratinized, as if the cornea has skin growing over it, blocking light from reaching the retina.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stevens-Johnson syndrome can be triggered by any medication or infection, although certain drugs such as seizure medications, gout medications and antibacterial sulfa drugs carry a higher risk. There are also certain genetic factors that could put someone at a higher risk of developing the disorder. Diaz noted that it can occur at any point in a person’s life, even after previous exposure to the same trigger without incident.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A tooth for an eye&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a healthy eye, the cornea acts like a windshield, allowing light to pass through to the lens and then to the retina, where it is converted into electrical signals sent to the brain. The cornea’s clarity depends on adequate lubrication and a steady renewal of cells by limbal stem cells. In conditions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome, those systems fail.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the cornea is permanently opaque and the eye rejects a cornea transplant, surgeons sometimes turn to tooth-in-eye surgery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A canine tooth, which is the longest tooth in the human mouth, is extracted from the jaw, along with a thin layer of bone around the tooth that provides support and blood, keeping it alive. The tooth is then shaved into a 4 millimeter-thick block and drilled to hold a plastic optical cylinder, explained Dr. Ben Kang, Chapman’s oral maxillofacial surgeon and division head of Oral &amp;amp; Maxillofacial Surgery at Vancouver General Hospital.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cnn-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2ltYWdlL2luc3RhbmNlcy9jbWVkYnAweHkwMDAxM2I2bmd4eGFhenVv-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2NtZWJ3eW95czAwMXgyN3BhYWV3dmF6eXo.jpg" alt="cnn L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2ltYWdlL2luc3RhbmNlcy9jbWVkYnAweHkwMDAxM2I2bmd4eGFhenVv L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2NtZWJ3eW95czAwMXgyN3BhYWV3dmF6eXo" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-777618" srcset="https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cnn-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2ltYWdlL2luc3RhbmNlcy9jbWVkYnAweHkwMDAxM2I2bmd4eGFhenVv-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2NtZWJ3eW95czAwMXgyN3BhYWV3dmF6eXo.jpg 900w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cnn-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2ltYWdlL2luc3RhbmNlcy9jbWVkYnAweHkwMDAxM2I2bmd4eGFhenVv-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2NtZWJ3eW95czAwMXgyN3BhYWV3dmF6eXo-225x300.jpg 225w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cnn-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2ltYWdlL2luc3RhbmNlcy9jbWVkYnAweHkwMDAxM2I2bmd4eGFhenVv-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2NtZWJ3eW95czAwMXgyN3BhYWV3dmF6eXo-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cnn-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2ltYWdlL2luc3RhbmNlcy9jbWVkYnAweHkwMDAxM2I2bmd4eGFhenVv-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2NtZWJ3eW95czAwMXgyN3BhYWV3dmF6eXo-860x1147.jpg 860w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cnn-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2ltYWdlL2luc3RhbmNlcy9jbWVkYnAweHkwMDAxM2I2bmd4eGFhenVv-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2NtZWJ3eW95czAwMXgyN3BhYWV3dmF6eXo-375x500.jpg 375w, https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cnn-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2ltYWdlL2luc3RhbmNlcy9jbWVkYnAweHkwMDAxM2I2bmd4eGFhenVv-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2NtZWJ3eW95czAwMXgyN3BhYWV3dmF6eXo-600x800.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The shaved tooth, embedded with a plastic optical cylinder. | Courtesy Greg Moloney via CNN Newsource&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The shaved tooth, with the lens in place, is implanted into the patient’s cheek or eyelid for several months, allowing soft tissue to grow around it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The tooth is a really ideal structure for holding a focusing element in place,” Moloney said. “It’s hard, it’s rigid, it survives in poor environments, and the body accepts it because it’s part of its own.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next step is to make a hole in the front of the patient’s eye to create space for the new complex.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once the tooth-lens complex is integrated with living tissue, it is surgically attached to the front of the eye, replacing the damaged cornea’s function. Tissue from inside the patient’s mouth is used to cover the tooth part of the device, giving the new eye a pink shade. Light can then pass through the clear lens to the retina, enabling vision again, provided that everything behind the cornea — the retina and optic nerve— remains healthy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moloney said there are two types of candidates for the surgery: people like Chapman, who have tried every other procedure, or those who are so severely affected by their initial disease that doctors know from the outset that other options won’t work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The surgery, which can take over 12 hours across two stages, is rare and performed by only a handful of specialists worldwide. But for people who qualify, success can mean regaining nearly normal vision.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s like watching people come out of a time capsule and reintroduce themselves to the world,” Moloney said. “It’s highly emotional for us.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chapman’s tooth was extracted in February, and the structure was placed into his eye in June. His last surgery, which straightened the lens to correct visual distortion, took place August 5.&lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; Regaining the human connection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chapman was fitted with glasses on August 13 and now has 20/30 vision, meaning he can see details at a distance of 20 feet that a person with perfect vision can see at 30 feet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first thing he saw after his surgery was the skyline from Moloney’s 16th-floor office.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It’s really indescribable, to be able to see the whole city and how there’s a whole world that’s just intersecting. When you’re blind or low-vision, you’re not seeing that, and you’re kind of in your head more. There’s a lot more mental chatter, and it can be difficult,” Chapman said. “Dr. Moloney and I made eye contact for the first time, and we both got quite emotional. I haven’t really made eye contact in 20 years.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before the tooth-in-eye surgery, Chapman was close to giving up hope.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We definitely didn’t have any more options. The transplants were lasting such a short time, and they were becoming more risky to do surgically,” he said. “Emotionally, even when I would get a new one, I knew it wasn’t going to last. This opened a new door for me and a new chapter in my life. This also provides more stability.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chapman is looking forward to traveling – with Japan being on the top of the list – but he wants to “just see the world and take it all in.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Chapman’s favorite sight? His niece and nephew.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I have a niece and a nephew that are 4 and 2. They’re just so cute and so much fun,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He is also a massage therapist and is looking forward to working again. “I’ve had a lot of time off work in the last couple of years with surgeries. I can give back and help people in pain and not make everything about me, and I think psychologically, that’s very helpful.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Above all, Chapman said, he is excited to dream again and “to not be limited by the instability of this condition and be able to plan and think ahead.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Before, I would always be afraid to plan because I’m afraid I’ll need emergency surgery or have an infection. It was so unpredictable, I would make these plans, and it would be heartbreaking when I couldn’t do them,” he said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having “human connection again visually” is something that people take for granted but is very powerful for people with poor vision.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We’ve been with him since he was a teenage boy. He’s waited till he’s 34 to get that,” Moloney said. “We’ve all waited a long time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>East Idaho News</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 14:53:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNcEJON1RBNHEzX1A5YnNncmtqWEZrMTdrV3l5VUtlMnpTTUw0dm1qd3hDZDBWU1h1cmRDUEx4M0E1WWt2cXJzX3lKT1Q2dTFkV3BKQ3JWcEJ6czFsQWFNMmtETmZ5T0ZHREdOdlpONlFFcGdvNDVWcDdFNmFNY3FFSVlPTGozS1lmTHVrVHRiNmZNNzB2bnZXMFdqekpnU1BhbUp5Um5R</guid></item><item><title>饮食改变可能使脑癌更容易治疗，早期研究提示- Live Science</title><link>https://www.livescience.com/health/cancer/diet-change-could-make-brain-cancer-easier-to-treat-early-study-hints</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto paywall-locker"&gt;

The study ambitiously combined laboratory research and clinical practice by drawing some of its data from tissue taken from the brains of patients undergoing cancer surgery. The study required the collaboration of experts in human and rodent brain surgery, metabolic pathways, and molecular analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protocol began in the hours before surgery. The patients received an infusion of glucose, which was tagged so that it was detectable by molecular analysis techniques. The glucose flowed through their bloodstreams and into both their healthy and tumorous cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fa8651e6-9513-4b3b-9fac-765ab5b921c4"&gt;A common approach for glioblastoma surgery is to remove the tumor and some surrounding brain tissue to minimize the risk of the cancer quickly growing back. The team took blood samples every 30 minutes during surgery and then flash-froze the excised tumor and healthy tissue for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These extracted cells had metabolized the glucose, and the researchers tracked the molecules' path through the cells. In concert with experiments in mice, the researchers gained a clear view into what tumor cells were doing differently as they gobbled up the sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthy cells metabolized glucose for cell processes like respiration, in which sugar and oxygen are converted into fuel for the cell. These cells also converted glucose into an amino acid called serine, a key ingredient for important neurotransmitter molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tumor cells, by contrast, set these processes aside. Instead, the cancer cells directed glucose to produce nucleotides — the building blocks of DNA. These molecules are vital fuel sources for the tumor cells' endless replication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/chemotherapy.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/chemotherapy.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Chemoradiation therapies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; attack cancer by destroying its DNA, but this rerouting gives the cancer cells a steady source of nucleotides with which to repair the damage. The study showed that the tumor cells also scavenged serine from surrounding tissues to further fuel their growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, Wahl and his team saw an opportunity. They put mice that had been transplanted with human cancer cells on a feeding regimen that drastically reduced their dietary serine. Lyssiotis suggested that this could potentially be replicated in human cancer patients with a low-protein diet supplemented with serine-free protein shakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this cut the amount of serine available for tumor cells, it forced the cancer to reroute its glucose metabolism back into serine production. In turn, this slashed their nucleotide synthesis and made the cells more vulnerable to chemoradiation. Mice given this treatment combination lived longer than mice that were only given chemoradiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyssiotis explained that this vulnerability would likely work for a limited time, as glioblastoma cells can deftly adapt their metabolisms. In addition, some tumor cells appeared to rely less than others on scavenged serine. "If you can hit that sweet spot, you deprive them of serine, and you come in with the therapies, you get them before they figure out a workaround," he suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wahl is already beginning work on a follow-up clinical study to back up these results in mice with data from human cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="1bb7d81c-d015-4344-80df-48a31070862d"&gt;"We hope to be bringing that to our patients later this year or early next year," he said. That work will also involve challenges and coordination. "Going through cancer treatment is hard. We're asking people to come up for radiation every day, to take chemotherapy. I think asking someone to also follow a prescribed diet could be tricky," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the current study has provided valuable information that will inform that future clinical work. "Part of what we're excited about is that this isotope tracing protocol [tracking the tagged glucose] can tell us which tumors are making serine from glucose and which tumors are taking serine up from the environment," Wahl said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lyssiotis noted that the paper's pioneering metabolic analysis has identified additional dietary changes that could be explored in future work. Serine modification is the easiest to implement, for the moment. "We think that that's just the tip of the iceberg," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-hZbaR79HnDPoMZdEaRfhML-OGstO55QLSDSwVADF1uxCGtcp8GLAZuZ" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-hZbaR79HnDPoMZdEaRfhML-OGstO55QLSDSwVADF1uxCGtcp8GLAZuZ slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical or dietary advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Far from universal condemnation, many people expressed support. This was especially true among younger people, with polls showing &lt;a href="https://emersoncollegepolling.com/december-2024-national-poll-young-voters-diverge-from-majority-on-crypto-tiktok-and-ceo-assassination/"&gt;41% of young adults&lt;/a&gt; viewed the murder as acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what leads the average person to justify extreme violence? &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/vio0000643"&gt;Our recently published research&lt;/a&gt;, in the special issue &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/vio/understanding-violent-extremism"&gt;“Understanding violent extremism”&lt;/a&gt; of the APA &lt;em&gt;Journal Psychology of Violence&lt;/em&gt;, locates the answer in one increasingly widespread phenomenon: workplace burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mangione’s &lt;a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/luigis-manifesto"&gt;manifesto&lt;/a&gt; cites “corruption and greed” as a source of frustration, a sentiment that resonates widely amid growing dissatisfaction with modern work environments. &lt;a href="https://clinicalsocialwork.eu/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cswhi_03_2024_02_butz_OPR_04.pdf"&gt;Recent research&lt;/a&gt; shows that broader patterns of systemic frustration and perceived corruption are associated with burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study, which took daily surveys from over 600 employees, suggests burnout may quietly fuel worrying attitudes – specifically, the potential justification of violent extremism – towards the perceived source of their distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The burnout to extremism pipeline&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our study, employees made daily notes of their burnout symptoms, emotional states, and violent extremist attitudes. On days when employees felt more burnt out, they reported significantly more sympathy toward extremist ideas, such as justifying violence against perceived injustices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The daily grind of burnout produced negative feelings of fear, sadness, shame, and guilt. To alleviate these negative feelings – and regain a sense of purpose – some individuals appeared to find extremist ideologies more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon can be explained through the combined lens of three established psychological theories. The first is &lt;a href="https://oxfordre.com/criminology/display/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264079.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264079-e-249"&gt;General Strain Theory&lt;/a&gt;, which suggests that daily frustrations lead to violent extremism through the experience of negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second is the &lt;a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315227979-4/burnout-existential-perspective-ayala-pines"&gt;existential model of burnout&lt;/a&gt;, which links burnout to a failed existential quest when meaningfulness in work disappears. Last is &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1037/gpr0000144"&gt;Significance Quest Theory&lt;/a&gt;, which argues that when the sense of personal significance is eroded in people’s everyday lives, they might look elsewhere, including to radical beliefs, to restore meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In combination, these ideas, particularly the existential and Significance Quest models, suggest that burnout reflects a failed search for meaning – one that may drive individuals toward violent extremism as a means of restoration. General Strain Theory further contributes by emphasising the emotional path involved in this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why burnout matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study does not suggest that individuals experiencing burnout will inevitably engage in extremist violence. Rather, it demonstrates how everyday experiences of burnout can subtly shift individuals toward violent extremist attitudes, thereby normalising the acceptance of violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This distinction is critical and is emphasised in the &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Famp0000062"&gt;two-pyramids model&lt;/a&gt;, which differentiates between radicalisation of opinion and radicalisation of action. While the link between the two may be weak, radicalisation of opinion alone can pose a &lt;a href="https://www.ijcv.org/index.php/ijcv/article/view/3807"&gt;serious threat to democracies and open societies&lt;/a&gt; by eroding social cohesion and fostering polarisation. For this reason, it warrants focused study in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, workplace burnout is alarmingly common, affecting approximately &lt;a href="https://www.vanede.nl/media/2669/gallup-iii-employee-burnout.pdf"&gt;three in four employees&lt;/a&gt;. This means a huge portion of the workforce experiences the emotional strain capable of fuelling extremist ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the vast majority will never resort to violence, a society that becomes increasingly tolerant of extremist attitudes risks normalising destructive behaviours and undermining both democratic values and workplace cohesion. Moreover, even if only a small minority ultimately engage in violence, the consequences can still be profound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Organisational support can help&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings also reveal an effective form of protection: &lt;a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf&amp;amp;doi=b6e9be0e81ee13424f7140685a689bd2d85d7d3c"&gt;perceived organisational support&lt;/a&gt;. Employees who felt that their organisations genuinely valued their contributions and cared about their wellbeing were less likely to gravitate toward extremist ideologies, even when experiencing burnout symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there’s a critical caveat to this: organisational support is most effective at mitigating the harmful effects of burnout before negative emotions take hold. Once employees have crossed that emotional threshold, additional support alone has limited power to prevent the escalation toward violent extremist attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employers therefore hold the key to addressing burnout before it escalates into something more serious. Organisations must proactively invest in burnout prevention, not merely as a health initiative, but as a vital strategy for preserving stability, both in the workplace and in society at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means promoting fairness and transparency in the workplace, ensuring employees feel recognised and valued, training managers to identify early signs of burnout and respond proactively, and establishing open, safe channels for employee feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns about fairness don’t stop at the office door. Broader perceptions of injustice in society may also fuel extremist sympathies, especially when individuals are already mentally exhausted. For instance, efforts to pursue the &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-pamela-bondi-directs-prosecutors-seek-death-penalty-luigi-mangione"&gt;death penalty against Mangione to serve President Trump’s political agenda&lt;/a&gt; may deepen perceptions of systemic unfairness, which will only exacerbate radical views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The broader implications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burnout is more than just workplace exhaustion or disengagement. It signals a deeper and more dangerous existential vulnerability. A workplace that ignores employee burnout doesn’t just risk lower productivity – it creates a breeding ground for ideological radicalisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As both workplaces and societies confront a surge in extremist sentiment, including support for violent acts framed as resistance to corporate greed, it is crucial that we learn to recognise the underlying psychological triggers. Burnout is one of them, and employees don’t just need support to do their jobs better – they need it to maintain a sense of meaning, stability, and connection in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A burnt-out mind will seek meaning wherever it can find it. If the workplace fails to offer that, extremist ideologies are often ready to fill the void, with consequences that reach far beyond the office walls.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261123/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261123/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study employed a double-blind, split-face design, comparing the left and right sides of the face and using advanced instruments along with subject self-assessments. The set of instruments used, together with the findings, is reported in the team's published article in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of Dermatologic Science and Cosmetic Technology&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our results indicated that the pterostilbene emulsion remarkably improved skin elasticity, firmness, and reduced wrinkles, such as forehead, undereye, and Crow's feet wrinkles, shares co-author Zhiyuan Chen, Founder of Guangzhou Luanying Cosmetics Co., Ltd. "It also increased the thickness of the epidermis layer, enhanced collagen and elastic fibers, and minimized skin pores."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to the control emulsion, the pterostilbene emulsion brought about statistically significant improvements, and all subjects expressed higher satisfaction with the pterostilbene emulsion. These results collectively demonstrated the superior anti-aging efficacy of the pterostilbene emulsion through multiple mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to corresponding author Xueping Chen, the findings advance our understanding of pterostilbene's role in skincare by providing evidence of its potent anti-ageing effects and supporting its use as an active ingredient in cosmetics. "It also offers a new perspective on natural compounds' applications in the skincare industry," says Chen. "The significant improvements in various skin parameters and the subjects' positive feedback highlight the effectiveness of pterostilbene, which may change the way we approach anti-ageing skincare formulations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors propose a longer study period to fully understand the impact of pterostilbene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

					&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ScienceDaily</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 13:26:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFBnX3ExSFc1eDl2U2EwU1dodGlJRTY4dGZWTTg1Wnc1c2xkNDFZeU9pajdoTkdoWlhxZzMtTUhxcVU2WHdZamdUTnRpdzIxckhwWnBUTUxCZkFyeThlRHZaR2VZejNwY0hQVTJOVmVpbw</guid></item><item><title>7个令人惊讶的迹象表明您实际上比90%的同龄人衰老得更好- VegOut</title><link>https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/s-7-surprising-signs-youre-aging-better-than-90-of-your-peers/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p&gt;My 72-year-old neighbor just helped me move a couch up three flights of stairs. Afterwards, while I caught my breath, she mentioned she'd already done her morning swim. "I'm slowing down," she said, genuinely believing it. That's when I realized: the people aging best often have no idea they're exceptional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We obsess over wrinkles and gray hair while missing what actually matters. The real markers of healthy aging aren't visible in bathroom mirrors—they're revealed in grocery stores, conversations, and the thousand small negotiations of daily life. These signs have nothing to do with looking younger and everything to do with staying fully alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. You can get up from the floor without using your hands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try it: sit cross-legged on the floor, then stand up. No hands, no knees, no furniture assists. Just rise. This simple move, called the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250404-sit-to-stand-the-simple-test-that-reveals-how-youre-ageing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sit-rise test&lt;/a&gt;, predicts longevity better than most medical exams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not about flexibility or strength alone—it's about coordination, balance, and something researchers call "functional reserve." People who can do this past 50 have maintained the complex integration of systems that most lose gradually, then suddenly. It means your body still works as a unit, not a collection of failing parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. You still change your mind about big things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When did your parents last admit they were wrong about something important? Real cognitive flexibility—not just learning new phone apps but actually revising core beliefs—is one of the strongest predictors of healthy brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aging brain's default is to crystallize, to defend positions rather than examine them. If you've changed your stance on something significant in the past year—politics, relationships, career priorities—your brain is maintaining its plasticity. You're not just learning; you're still capable of unlearning, which is infinitely harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Your friends span multiple decades&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at who you spend time with. If your social circle includes people 20 years younger and older, you're defeating one of aging's sneakiest threats: generational isolation. Most people unconsciously age-sort themselves, sliding into demographic bubbles that reinforce their obsolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intergenerational friendships keep you culturally bilingual. You're not trying to be young or accepting being old—you're just being present across the full spectrum of life. The 30-year-old who seeks your advice and the 80-year-old who makes you laugh are both keeping you alive in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. You're still bad at things (on purpose)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When did you last feel like a complete beginner? Not frustrated by technology, but actively choosing to be terrible at something new—pottery, languages, pickleball. The willingness to be publicly incompetent is a superpower that most people surrender by 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557811/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Neuroplasticity research&lt;/a&gt; shows that novel challenges create new neural pathways at any age. But here's the kicker: the benefit comes from the struggle, not the mastery. Your brain needs the humiliation of being bad at things. Those who age best never stop volunteering for beginner status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. You sleep through the night without medication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not every night, but most nights. No Ambien, no 3 AM anxiety spirals, no revenge bedtime procrastination. Just sleep, the kind that actually repairs your brain and body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't about virtue—it's about system integrity. Good sleep past 50 means your &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aah4968" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;circadian rhythms&lt;/a&gt;, hormone levels, and stress responses are still synchronized. While peers pop melatonin and scroll through WebMD at 2 AM, you're getting the cellular renovation that keeps everything else functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. You can hear conversations in restaurants&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not perfectly, but you can track dialogue in a noisy room without exhaustion. This isn't just about ear health—it's about something called &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8784007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cognitive spare capacity&lt;/a&gt;. Your brain can still filter, process, and comprehend complex audio environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People don't realize how much aging happens in the spaces between our senses and our processing. When restaurant conversation becomes work, social life shrinks. Those who can still engage in chaotic sound environments maintain connection to the loud, messy, vital world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. You're planning something for five years from now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not dreaming, not hoping—actually planning. A trip, a project, a move. Something that assumes you'll be capable and interested in the future. This psychological time horizon, what researchers call "&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0197455624000558#:~:text=Future%20time%20perspective%20is%20a,that%20are%20difficult%20to%20discuss." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;future time perspective&lt;/a&gt;,"separates thriving from surviving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people unconsciously shrink their temporal horizons with age, planning months ahead instead of years. But those aging best still plant trees they'll sit under, start books series they'll finish, make plans that assume future vitality. They're not in denial about mortality—they just refuse to rehearse for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret about aging well: it's not defeating time but staying interested in it. Every marker above shares this—engagement over withdrawal, curiosity over certainty, connection over isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My stair-climbing neighbor doesn't do yoga or drink green juice. She does something more radical: she assumes tomorrow will require her full presence, so she maintains capacity for it. She keeps functional not from vanity but from practical optimism—believing life will keep asking things of her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real healthy aging isn't measured by how young you look but how far forward you're still reaching. It's maintaining what gerontologists call "openness to experience"—the opposite of the slow closing that marks decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're aging well when the future feels worth preparing for, when your body remains a vehicle rather than a betrayal, when you can still surprise yourself with your own opinions. These aren't just luck or genetics—they're choices, accumulated daily, to stay in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mirror lies. These signs don't. And perhaps the biggest sign you're aging well is this: you're more interested in what you're becoming than what you're losing.&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks to obesity and alcohol consumption, bowel cancer has become the primary cause of the rising death toll among young adults. It is getting increasingly common, especially among younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent studies from places like the US and Europe show worrying increases in young-onset colorectal cancer. Researchers believe lifestyle and diet are major contributors. While genetics and screening gaps play a role, what we eat every day seems to be one of the most changeable risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing which foods may increase risk and what to replace them with can help young adults make smarter choices. Even small changes over time matter, especially in diets heavy in processed meats, sugar, saturated fats, and ultra-processed foods. According to nutrition experts, oncologists, and epidemiologists, this is a “preventable risk” because diet is something people can adjust long before any symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this guide, we explore seven foods linked to higher colon cancer risk in young adults, explain why they are problematic, and provide healthier options to swap them with. Whether you’re looking to protect your long-term health or just want to eat better today, these food swaps can help lower your risk of colon cancer and improve overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 12:49:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>忘记RoboCop ：这些哈佛大学的工科学生创造了一个获奖的“机器人袜子” -波士顿环球报</title><link>https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/09/15/business/harvard-robotic-sock-ai/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content
              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;There are already mechanical devices that correct foot drop, including metal and plastic braces that wrap around the leg and ankle. Wagman isn’t a fan. “All of these mobility devices are all pretty much the same since the 1940s,” Wagman said. “They’re very cumbersome.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In contrast, he says their system is comfortable and practically invisible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Sole1 just won the &lt;a href="https://www.jamesdysonaward.org/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.jamesdysonaward.org/en-US/"&gt;US James Dyson Award&lt;/a&gt;, a competition for engineering students sponsored by the British inventor best known for his best-selling vacuum cleaners. Wagman and Bokisch hope to eventually bring it to market at a price between $1,000 and $2,000. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Clearly not the kind of sock you want to lose in the dryer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Bokisch is an undergraduate at Harvard’s Paulson School of Engineering, while Wagman is working on a master’s degree in design engineering, having earned a bachelor’s in industrial design at Savannah College of Art and Design. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Both men paid a price for their army service. Wagman never saw combat. “I was sent to the border wall,” he said. But as an airborne soldier, he made 30 parachute drops and was badly injured in one of them. Today, he’s partially disabled.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I was fortunate enough to work in Afghanistan,” Bokisch said. He served as a sniper during a single nine-month tour and cherishes the memory of a friend in a special forces unit, who wore a prosthetic leg and joked about his “bulletproof foot.” Bokisch himself was never wounded. But he suffered several serious injuries and, like Wagman, is partially disabled. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Our backs are [screwed up] from the army,” Wagman said. “Our legs are messed up, because of falling out of planes, being deployed.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

When the foot is lowered, the toes hit first and drag across the ground. This often causes trips and falls. People with foot drop compensate by raising one leg higher than the other when walking. This gives them an awkward gait and can lead to joint and spine trouble.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Foot drop isn’t a disease in itself but a common symptom of diseases that afflict millions, including stroke, muscular dystrophy, Parkinson’s disease, and cerebral palsy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It basically unravels people’s lives,” Wagman said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The Sole1 device uses an ankle bracelet with a computer and an inertial measuring unit to measure the exact position of the ankle. The bracelet plugs into electrical contacts on the sock, which are connected to filaments that run toward the toe of the sock. The filaments are made of “shape memory alloy,” a springlike metal that flexes when heated. The sock also contains another inertial measuring unit to track the position of the foot. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;With every step, the computer uses a predictive algorithm to measure the angle of the forefoot relative to the ankle. If it’s drooping, it sends power to the filaments, flexing them to pull the foot upright. The sock’s software uses an artificial intelligence system that’s supposed to track the owner’s gait to improve the sock’s performance over time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0 text_align_left"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Alan Asbeck, an associate professor of engineering at Virginia Tech, said that Bokisch and Wagman may have found a way to make a foot drop device that’s more comfortable and less obtrusive than existing systems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It looks like the design of this one is really low profile,” Asbeck said. “I do think there is a need for this general sort of thing.” But he added that he hasn’t tested the Sole1 to determine if it works as advertised.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The two veterans are now recruiting volunteers to test Sole1 in real-world conditions. If it works out, Wagman and Bokisch hope to create more ambitious robotic devices for the arms and legs that will be powerful but almost invisible. The goal, Bokisch said, is “cool cyberpunk gear that young men and women are stoked to wear.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

What's more, some of these mutations were awfully familiar. Spike mutations matched positions of those seen in the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within just one person, the same types of mutations that led to the emergence of the faster multiplying &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2_Omicron_variant"&gt;omicron variant&lt;/a&gt; were on their way to being repeated. This backs the theory that omicron-like changes developed from selection pressures the virus experiences inside our bodies, the researchers explain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174249" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174249" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/LongCOVIDShowsUpInBrainScans.jpg" alt="Brainstems mapping differences in healthy and long covid brains" class="wp-image-174249 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174249" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Long COVID can cause changes in people's brains.

    &lt;p&gt;I remember, not so long ago, when every young guy in the gym would come and ask me, “How do I get bigger &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/fitness/walking/calves-shins-walking/"&gt;calves&lt;/a&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As my client base has gradually become older, this doesn’t tend to happen so often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But should we all actually be thinking about this often-forgotten muscle as we get older?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those of us with larger calves are less likely to &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/bones-joints/osteoporosis-ageing-bones/"&gt;fall and break bones&lt;/a&gt;. But we’re also more likely to have better &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/three-easy-ways-stabilise-blood-sugar-levels/"&gt;blood sugar management&lt;/a&gt;, better &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/10/16/standing-desks-sydney-university-circulation-thrombosis/"&gt;circulation&lt;/a&gt; and better &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/ageing/habits-to-keep-brain-young-superagers/"&gt;cognition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So targeting our calf muscles in midlife and beyond makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The benefits of strong calf muscles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Better heart health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The calf is made up of two key muscles, the gastrocnemius and the soleus, which lies beneath it. The soleus muscle is often referred to as the “second heart” because of the huge pump effect it has at returning deoxygenated blood back up towards the heart. The stronger our lower limb muscles, the greater this pump effect and the better our circulation. This then has a massive impact on &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/heart-health/how-to-prevent-a-heart-attack/"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s no surprise, then, that research shows a link between higher calf strength and improved cardiovascular health, including lower blood pressure and a lower risk of heart failure after a &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/heart-health/warning-signs-of-heart-disease-attack-symptoms/"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Brain health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may seem odd, but strong calf muscles are also associated with better brain health, with researchers suggesting a calf size of at least 33cm for women and 34 cm for men as protective. Why might this be? Clearly, a strong calf muscle does not by itself lead to better brain function. However, as we’ve already noted, strong leg muscles lead to greater blood flow, and we know that more oxygenated blood to the brain reduces cognitive decline. In addition, those of us with strong calves are more likely to be speedy walkers or to play sports. Studies show that people who &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/fitness/walking/health-benefits-of-walking/"&gt;walk&lt;/a&gt; faster have slower cognitive decline, and the same goes for those who play racquet sports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do strong calves make healthy brains? No, but strong lower bodies make for active people, and active people are more sociable, and greater sociability keeps us young in every way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Fall prevention&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong calves, combined with strong feet and strong shin muscles, play a major role in not only our &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/ageing/exercises-to-avoid-falls-like-elton-john/"&gt;balance&lt;/a&gt; and ability to correct our footing but also our postural alignment. The firmer our footing floor and the stronger the muscles in our lower limbs and feet, the less strain there is on the knees and the hips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How to strengthen your calf muscles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So which muscles do we need to target?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we start with the calf muscles, we can split this muscle group into two major muscles, the gastrocnemius and the soleus. The gastrocnemius is the big muscle that forms the main big belly of the calf as it runs from the femur under the back of the knee to the lower leg. The soleus is the deeper muscle that sits under the gastrocnemius and goes from under the knee and converges on the Achilles tendon at the back of the heel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These muscle groups are responsible for pointing your toes and bending the knee and are used for propulsion movements such as walking, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/fitness/running/how-to-start-running-at-40/"&gt;running&lt;/a&gt; and jumping. If we want to walk faster or for longer or run faster or jump higher, these muscles need to be strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong calves are incredibly important to the strength of the lower limb, working in tandem with our shin muscles and feet&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern shoes and trainers are, on the whole, not designed to benefit our foot strength or shape.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;I see it in the gym when we do squats or lunges with a new client, and you can see the lack of control from the toes and the inability to create a wide balance and contact point with the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should all spend more time with our shoes and socks off and I would suggest doing these calf exercises, or actually any lower body exercises, barefoot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong calves and strong feet is most definitely the ideal combination for anti-ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The best exercises for strong calves&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Single leg hopping&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This plyometric exercise targets the calf muscles by requiring explosive power and control during each hop. The repeated push-off and landing motion engages the calves intensely, helping to build strength, endurance and stability.&lt;/p&gt;

Bubblegum. Cherry Cola. They might sound like sweets, but these artificial flavours are part of a chemical cocktail inhaled deep into the lungs by people who vape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Britons are now vaping in unprecedented numbers – around one in ten adults (9.8 per cent) in 2023, rising to 15.8 per cent among 16 to 24-year-olds, according to the Office for National Statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while vapes are generally considered safer than cigarettes, and seen as a useful tool for quitting smoking, experts are warning the effects of the chemicals, solvents, sweeteners and flavourings found in e-cigarettes can have significant health risks, including lung damage – and these are still emerging as it’s a relatively new area of research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The potential dangers were spelt out in a 2023 study which found people who vaped had DNA damage in mouth cells at similar levels to cigarette smokers, reported the journal Nicotine &amp;amp; Tobacco Research – the highest levels were seen in people using the pod-style devices now standard in Britain (different from a disposable vape, this has a battery and heating coil, and a replaceable pod containing the liquid).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another study last year found that people who smoke and vape are four times more likely to develop lung &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-4a5a3ca0-921d-11f0-960c-491e20504623"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; than those who just smoke, the Journal of Oncology Research and Therapy reported. The researchers, from &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/ohio/index.html" id="mol-4a62ef30-921d-11f0-960c-491e20504623"&gt;Ohio&lt;/a&gt; State University, speculated this was due to the amount of chemicals in vapes that may be carcinogenic (cancer-causing) in their own right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It’s not just the lungs that could be affected: chronic vaping was linked to impaired blood vessel function, which is an early warning sign for heart disease, according to 2024 study in the journal Tobacco Induced Disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vapes contain nicotine, which is a vasoconstrictor, meaning it narrows blood vessels, so it could contribute to cardiovascular problems in people who already have underlying heart disease, explains Lion Shahab, a professor of health psychology at University College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Britons are now vaping in unprecedented numbers – around one in ten adults (9.8 per cent) in 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He adds nicotine may also impair the body’s ability to regulate blood sugar, which could increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, though evidence for this remains inconclusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As Cancer Research UK points out, vaping is much less harmful than smoking. But it is not risk-free, and experts stress children, teenagers and non-smokers should not vape at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts fear exposure during adolescence, when lungs are still developing, could increase the risk of lasting respiratory problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox floatRHS health" data-version="2" id="mol-3be362f0-921d-11f0-960c-491e20504623" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15099583/hidden-vaping-effects-quit-good-guide-addictive.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;DID YOU KNOW? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt; &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A black-market ‘thousands-of-puffs’ disposable vape can cost between £5 to £10 from market stalls or via social media, while a legal kit from a supermarket costs around £7 to £13, and about £5 for a 10ml refill. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Indeed, the journal BMC Medicine reported in May last year teenagers in England and North America were more likely to suffer breathing problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Concerned, in February 2025, the UK Government launched a ten-year study that will follow 100,000 children and teenagers aged eight to 18 to track how vaping affects their health over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We are exposing children to an experimental risk,’ Andrew Grigg, a professor of paediatric respiratory medicine at Queen Mary University of London, told Good Health.‘We now have a generation of young people hooked on nicotine and they are inhaling not just nicotine, but a mixture of flavourings and chemicals into developing lungs, substances we know very little about when inhaled’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Grigg explains in lab studies these chemicals reduce key cell functions in the airway and may increase the risk of bacterial infections such as bronchitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We’re already seeing more bronchitis symptoms in children who vape,’ he adds, referring to persistent cough, wheezing and airway inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vaping isn’t the only potential cause, however front line doctors are seeing more under-18s hooked on nicotine vapes turning up with chest tightness, wheeze, persistent cough, palpitations, nausea, headaches and anxiety, it was reported in earlier this year by researchers from Alder Hey Children’s Hospital, and other institutes, who called for dedicated NHS services for children addicted to vaping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This is not a harmless habit,’ says Professor Grigg, ‘and the long-term risks are unknown’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Andrew Grigg, a professor of paediatric respiratory medicine at Queen Mary University of London&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So what exactly is in vapes that makes them potentially so dangerous? Good Health spoke to leading scientists and clinicians...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;WHY YOU CAN’T STOP PUFFING&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The main ingredient in vapes is nicotine, the same addictive substance found in cigarettes. It is added to satisfy cravings and help smokers switch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both legal and illegal vapes usually contain it, although some liquids are nicotine-free. The difference is illegal versions often carry far higher levels than laws allow – tests have found some packed with up to triple the legal limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The nicotine is usually delivered in one of two forms: ‘freebase’ nicotine, a purer chemical version that produces a harsher throat hit, or nicotine salts, which are smoother and easier to inhale at higher concentrations (legal vapes tend to contain the salts).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A typical cigarette gives a smoker around 1 to 2mg of nicotine. By law, UK-approved vapes are capped at 20mg per millilitre of liquid; roughly 2 per cent strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In practice modern devices are designed to hit like a cigarette, often delivering a similar nicotine hit in a single session pf 10 to 15 puffs, though the exact dose depends on the gadget and how it is used. Nicotine salts allow delivery that is closer to that from cigarettes and so they are likely to be better at helping smokers quit,’ says Peter Hajek, a professor of clinical psychology and Director of the Tobacco Dependence Research Unit at Queen Mary University of London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once inhaled, the nicotine in the e-liquid rapidly enters your bloodstream, causing the body to release adrenaline, which in turn raises your blood pressure, pulse and breathing rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;CONCERNS ABOUT OTHER INGREDIENTS&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vapes heat e-liquid, turning it into an aerosol that can be inhaled – as a result ultra-fine particles and dissolved chemicals can reach deep into the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They can stick and slip into cells. The liquid is propylene glycol (PG) and vegetable glycerin (VG), which hold the nicotine and flavourings. Both compounds are used in foods and medicine, but their safety when inhaled is less certain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As Professor Shahab, a leading expert on vaping, explains: ‘PG and VG are considered safe in drink or food form. However, some lab and animal research suggests that VG in particular may affect cell health when inhaled.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lion Shahab, a professor of health psychology at University College London&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For instance, a 2018 lab-based study in Frontiers in Physiology found vegetable glycerin, especially when combined with certain flavourings, can weaken the protective cells that line the lungs and reduce their ability to repair themselves or fight infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vapers inhale an aerosol, but if the heating coil gets too hot – which can happen particularly in ‘dry puff’ conditions, i.e. when there isn’t enough liquid left to heat – PG and VG can break down into chemicals such as formaldehyde (a known carcinogen) and acrolein (a potent irritant).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both can irritate the airways, according to the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment, an official UK expert advisory group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;AND THE ENTICING FLAVOURS...&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The different flavours in vapes come from a wide range of chemicals, many also used in food products, including vanilla, ethyl maltol (sweet) and menthol (mint). But inhaling them is different from swallowing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘In lab and animal studies some flavours, such as vanilla, menthol and cherry-type flavourings, may affect cell viability,’ says Professor Shahab. In other words, cells may work less effectively – for instance in the lungs that can translate into irritation, inflammation and weaker defences against infection. Cinnamon flavour, which contains cinnamaldehyde, and cherry-type flavourings that use benzaldehyde have been repeatedly highlighted in lab studies as among the most irritating and potentially toxic to airway cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For example, a 2018 study in Scientific Reports found both chemicals damaged lung cells exposed to e-cigarette vapour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Laboratory work has shown cinnamon-flavoured liquids containing cinnamaldehyde suppress the tiny hair-like cilia that clear the airways and also blunt immune cell function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reviews in journals such as Tobacco Control in 2020 have warned a wide range of flavourings can be toxic to airway cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vape packs must include an ingredients list, but flavouring chemicals are usually grouped together simply as ‘flavourings’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The full list is provided to the UK regulator, the MHRA, but not always shown to consumers. The UK bans additives known to be risky such as diacetyl, a buttery-tasting chemical linked with a rare lung condition, bronchiolitis obliterans, or ‘popcorn lung’, named this because it was first seen in staff working in a microwave popcorn factory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘None of the flavourings allowed in UK-regulated vapes is linked with actual disease’ adds Professor Shahab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But studies show diacetyl and other additives still appear in vapes sold in other countries outside of Europe, often without restrictions. It’s also been found in illegal vapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;THE METAL IN THE DEVICE ITSELF&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Red flags for illegal and unsafe vapes are super-strength devices with oversized tanks. They can feature cartoon-style branding, and are sold via social media or market stalls&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have found that metals from the heating coil, including nickel, chromium and lead, can leach into the vapour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2018 study in Environmental Health Perspectives detected these metals in e-cigarette aerosols from popular brands. A 2020 review in Environmental Research confirmed while levels are generally lower than in cigarette smoke, they still raise health concerns over time, adds Professor Shahab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;HOW CAN I TELL IF A VAPE IS ILLEGAL?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Illegal vapes are flooding into the UK: trading standards officers say they are seizing millions of devices each year from corner shops, market stalls and even high street chains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023/24 they confiscated 1.19million illicit vapes, a 59 per cent rise on the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Border Force reported an even sharper rise at entry points, with seizures soaring from less than a million in 2022 to around 4.5million between January and October 2023. A further 1.14million were seized in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Disposables, which fuelled much of the vaping craze, are now banned in Britain as of June 1, 2025. With refillable devices, cost is one clue to whether it’s an illegal product or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Legal vapes also follow strict rules. A legitimate UK product will always be reusable or refillable, with a tank or pod capacity no greater than 2ml. E-liquids must be sold in 10ml bottles, with nicotine content capped at 20mg/ml (2 per cent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Packaging should be child-resistant and tamper-evident, with a batch number and UK contact details on the box.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every product must carry a prominent nicotine warning covering 30 per cent of the front and back. Branding should never be cartoonish or designed to appeal to children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exact product will also appear on the MHRA’s public list of notified products, check on gov.uk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is not a stamp of approval in the way a medicine is licensed, but it does mean the device meets strict standards on nicotine strength, tank size, packaging and labelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Red flags for illegal and unsafe vapes are super-strength devices with oversized tanks, with claims of ‘3,000 to 10,000 puffs’, extra-strong liquid such as ‘5 per cent or 50mg’; they might have no warnings, or the warnings are in a foreign language; they can feature cartoon-style branding, and are sold via social media or market stalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Any vape advertised as containing THC, ‘spice’ or other psychoactive substances should be avoided outright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Products may sometimes be sold as containing the black-market drug THC (the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis), but in fact can contain spice, a cheaper synthetic chemical that’s far more unpredictable and harmful than cannabis – and highly addictive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent University of Bath study revealed around one in six vapes confiscated in secondary schools in England tested positive for spice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;HOW THEY COMPARE TO CIGARETTES&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Cigarette smoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals, including over 70 known carcinogens, and is uniquely harmful and kills more than one out of every two lifelong smokers,’ says Professor Shahab. ‘By comparison, e-cigarette vapour is far simpler, mainly consisting of relatively harmless ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘So it is likely the impact of vapes on health is magnitudes of order lower than smoking cigarettes.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine in 2017, led by Professor Shahab, found that people who vaped exclusively for at least six months had dramatically lower levels of toxic and carcinogenic markers than those who smoked cigarettes or used both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In some cases, the reduction was as high as 97 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Shabab uses the analogy of smoking as base-jumping and vaping as running: ‘Base-jumping is known to be quite risky, and marathon running can also carry risks but at a much lower rate.’ Vaping should not be a new habit for non-smokers but a stepping stone to quitting for those already addicted to cigarettes, he emphasises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;THE WAYS YOU CAN VAPE SAFELY&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you’re going to vape, choose a refillable product from a reputable UK retailer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nicotine should be used at the lowest strength that still controls cravings, with the aim of tapering down over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Do not use devices to chase a ‘buzz’, suggest experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Avoid unpleasant and possibly harmful ‘dry puffs’ by keeping the tank topped up, and don’t run devices at excessive power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Never mix your own liquids, and never use products that may contain THC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you experience chest pain, tightness, breathlessness or a persistent cough, stop vaping and seek medical advice immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Battery safety is also key: only use the supplied charger, avoid charging overnight, and never carry loose batteries in a pocket with coins or keys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;AND IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING TO QUIT VAPES...&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vast majority of the UK’s 5.5 million vapers are ex-smokers or current smokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while experts generally agree vapes are less harmful than cigarettes, vaping is by no means risk free – potential harms include a risk of collapsed lungs, heart damage and possibly memory loss and leaky gut, while the e-liquids in vapes can contain toxic chemicals, including arsenic, lead and formaldehyde.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So ultimately, experts would prefer it we didn’t smoke or vape at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet quitting vapes can be difficult, as the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-573b6d10-921b-11f0-960c-491e20504623" class=""&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; in the US says: ‘Quitting vaping is likely similar to quitting smoking because both involve nicotine addiction and quitting may lead to withdrawal symptoms.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some vapers may be unknowingly inhaling more nicotine daily than a cigarette smoker with a 20-a-day habit. The amount of nicotine in each draw depends on the vape make but as a general rule, manufacturers advise that ten puffs on your vape are about the same as ten puffs on a cigarette.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Vaping is by no means risk free – potential harms include a risk of collapsed lungs, heart damage and possibly memory loss and leaky gut&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A standard 20mg/ml vape, which allows for 600-800 puffs, with 40mg of nicotine is equivalent to smoking one or two packs of 20 cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And illegal vapes, which are cheaper and unregulated, may contain more nicotine, warns Dr Gareth Nye, a lecturer in biomedical sciences at the University of Salford. ‘Vaping generally is harder to quit simply due to the level of nicotine involved in most products. Most vapes will contain significantly higher levels than traditional cigarettes – as nicotine is the primary addictive agent, this is the problem in quitting.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Exacerbating this ‘is the fact that users report higher number of puffs compared with cigarettes and the habits can be tricky to break’, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;(Nicotine-free vapes are available, but these are a very small proportion of the total, according to the government’s Creating a Smokefree Generation consultation.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There may also be psychological issues to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘There is the illusion that vaping is safe to continue and therefore people are less likely to stop,’ says Dr Nye. ‘Although vaping is safer, it isn’t without its risks and vaping products are always intended to be stepping stone to being completely free of nicotine products.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He adds NHS resources are focused on smoking cessation but ‘there are a few clinics opening that offer vaping cessation support’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The charity Asthma + Lung UK has recently suggested all stop-smoking schemes should also cover e-cigarettes. So what tools are available now to help you quit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-medium mol-style-bold"&gt;TEXT MESSAGE SUPPORT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regular texts to support your efforts is one approach that’s been proven to work – in teens, at least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When 13 to 17-year-old vapers in the US were enrolled on a text message-based quit-vaping programme, after seven months they were 35 per cent more likely to succeed compared to teenagers who weren’t on the programme, reported the Journal of the American Medical Association last year. Those on the programme received daily ‘timely and compelling messages’, full of tips and advice from real people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Similarly, a recent review by the authoritative Cochrane group found that text message programmes may be effective for those aged 13 to 24. ‘The text message interventions were only tested in younger people, but our findings don’t mean that they wouldn’t also be successful in older people,’ says Dr Nicola Lindson, an associate professor at the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are free programmes that offer motivational text messages (e.g. via stopsmokinglondon.com).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-medium mol-style-bold"&gt;VARENICLINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This drug (brand name Champix) works by blocking nicotine receptors in the brain, making smoking and vaping less rewarding and reducing cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the latest Cochrane review, varenicline appeared to double the chances of quitting vaping compared with people receiving no medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It’s not yet licensed in the UK for vaping, but can be prescribed on private prescription on an off-label basis for reducing nicotine cravings, whatever causes them,’ says pharmacist Sultan Dajani. ‘Common side-effects can include chest discomfort, constipation, dizziness, drowsiness, as well as headache and weight gain.’ The usual course is 12 weeks of a twice-daily pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-medium mol-style-bold"&gt;NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY (NRT)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;NRT has long been the go-to method for quitting smoking, but there’s growing evidence that it may help vapers quit, too. It’s available over-the-counter (and on NHS prescription for smoking).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sultan Dajani suggests the mouth sprays are potentially most effective for vapers. ‘They’re easy to use, safe and fast acting – and mimick the habit of taking puffs.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-medium mol-style-bold"&gt;REDUCE THE STRENGTH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cutting down on nicotine vaping gradually ‘can make stopping much easier...it allows the body time to adjust to lower nicotine levels’, according to the National Centre for Smoking Cessation and Training in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its suggestions include increasing the time between vaping and lowering the strength of nicotine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sultan Dajani advises: ‘Check your e-liquid’s nicotine content and gradually reduce it over time. If you find yourself vaping more at this lower level, it may be a sign that you’ve reduced your nicotine intake too quickly.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Spacing out puffs can also help. ‘If you vape every 20 minutes, try to extend that to once every 40 minutes instead. Over time, this will reduce your cravings’ he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;Additional reporting by Thea Jourdan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 11:02:31 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxNT0QtM3JXRHRRN3lvbmwzanV3LWJ1ZThWLXIxbG9qUUFhdDc3RGpPWThMbU5tOEh1ZTVCZy1qWjhBUFVWNGptRW5VMnZqdUFMVUNNLVFwVXpQN1hnNTFGY2dZZnN3eGtDUWtpZWtTeDhXOEw0MGt0VUZPTHRKMXJtSnlVRE53TnhsRVZxVEprTWpGQ1FPZnVyLVVFb19NU05sV1NrZC1IMA</guid></item><item><title>是时候停止食用塑料了。首先，清理这7件充满微塑料的物品- CNET</title><link>https://www.cnet.com/health/its-time-to-stop-eating-plastic-start-by-trashing-these-7-items-full-of-microplastics/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="c-ShortcodeContent c-ShortcodeContent-theme:default sm:u-col-2 md:u-col-6 lg:u-col-12"&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p1"&gt;It's a strange thought, but you're probably consuming tiny bits of plastic with your meals every day. They're called &lt;span section="shortcodeLink"&gt;&lt;a href="/health/nutrition/microplastics-are-everywhere-heres-how-to-avoid-them-in-8-common-foods/" rel class="c-shortcodeLink c-shortcodeLink-active"&gt;&lt;span&gt;microplastics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and these invisible particles are practically everywhere-in our food, our water, and even the air. For a long time, no one was sure what that meant, but we're now learning this constant exposure might be a real problem for our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;For example, a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03453-1" target="_self"&gt;February 2025 study&lt;/a&gt; found that these plastic bits aren't just passing through our systems. They can actually build up inside our bodies. That discovery has obviously raised serious questions about what this could mean long-term, especially as scientists look into potential links to major health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So where is all this plastic coming from? A huge source is a place you'd least expect: your own kitchen. Between food wrap, containers, and even some cookware, the plastics add up. The good news is, you can lower your exposure with a few easy changes. Let's start by looking at where they're most likely hiding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=cnet.com" target="_self"&gt;Don't miss any of CNET's unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are microplastics harmful?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics have become a serious problem for pollution, and now scientists worry about their potential health effects. An estimated &lt;a href="https://www.ciel.org/breathing-plastic-the-health-impacts-of-invisible-plastics-in-the-air/" target="_self"&gt;22 million micro and nanoplastics&lt;/a&gt; are inhaled by humans each year, and that is largely because they are so hard to avoid. You're exposed to microplastics in &lt;a href="https://hsc.unm.edu/news/2024/08/hsc-newsroom-post-minimizing-microplastics.html" target="_self"&gt;three ways&lt;/a&gt;: inhalation, ingestion or touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822?query=featured_home" target="_self"&gt;have been shown&lt;/a&gt; to cause a number of issues in the human body. Microplastics and nanoplastics found in blood vessels &lt;a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/whats-lurking-in-your-body-mayo-researchers-probing-health-risks-of-tiny-plastic-particles/" target="_self"&gt;have been linked&lt;/a&gt; to an increased risk of heart attack, stroke and, in severe cases, even death. Tissue inflammation, cell death and lung and liver impacts &lt;a href="https://magazine.hms.harvard.edu/articles/microplastics-everywhere" target="_self"&gt;have all been noted&lt;/a&gt;. In animals and marine life, they can also cause oxidative and DNA damage, as well as cancer. Mice were shown to have reduced sperm count, ovarian scarring and hereditary metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much is still unknown about the exact effects of microplastics, but studies so far have been sobering. They've inspired many home chefs to reconsider what they use in the kitchen and put in their bodies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics are plastic particles smaller than 5 millimeters. Nanoplastics are much smaller and invisible to the naked eye, ranging from 1 to 1,000 nanometers -- a fraction of the width of a human hair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Svetlozar Hristov/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Where microplastics hide in your kitchen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics are more common than you think. These are some places they may be hiding in your kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Nonstick cookware&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study found that plastic and nonstick cookware &lt;a href="https://pml.ac.uk/news/new-study-shows-plastic-and-non-stick-cookware-is/" target="_self"&gt;released microplastics&lt;/a&gt; into food during cooking, heightening one's exposure to these potentially harmful pollutants. Australian researchers &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004896972205392X" target="_self"&gt;estimate&lt;/a&gt; that Teflon-coated cookware contains thousands, maybe millions, of microplastic particles, while a simple crack or fracture in your pan &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004896972205392X" target="_self"&gt;could mean&lt;/a&gt; exposure to over two million microplastic particles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Plastic food containers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your Uber delivery could inadvertently be damaging your health, and it has nothing to do with what you order. With the rise of home delivery services, plastic containers are more common than ever, but these containers &lt;a href="https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/2023/11/safer-storage-avoiding-microplastic-concerns-while-managing-holiday" target="_self"&gt;can easily add&lt;/a&gt; microplastics to your food when heated or washed. One study found that all reusable plastic takeout containers typically used by restaurants contain microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Plastic utensils&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic utensils can leach microplastics into your food when exposed to high heat levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Kinga Krzeminska/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies also show that plastic utensils &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016041202400326X" target="_self"&gt;release microplastics&lt;/a&gt; into your food, especially when used with hotter foods. When you ingest the food, you also ingest microplastics that settle into your body and bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Tea bags&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may come as a surprise, but microplastics could be hiding in your tea bags. When you brew tea, the bag is exposed to extremely high temperatures that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10389239/" target="_self"&gt;can release&lt;/a&gt; its microplastics. This comes from polypropylene, a key component in the manufacturing of tea bags. Researchers at Spain's Autonomous University of Barcelona found that billions of microplastic and nanoplastic particles &lt;a href="https://www.uab.cat/web/newsroom/news-detail/-1345830290613.html?detid=1345940427095" target="_self"&gt;are released&lt;/a&gt; from a single tea bag for every millimeter of water it is submerged in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has shown that a single plastic tea bag can release billions of microplastic fragments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Zarina Lukash/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;5. Certain spices&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on how it is packaged, that bottle of paprika could be full of microplastics. Many spices today use plastic packaging, which is concerning because one recent study found microplastics in all plastic containers tested. This can result in food contamination, which &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0269749122019613" target="_self"&gt;has increased&lt;/a&gt; in recent decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;6. Plastic straws&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic straws are especially concerning because &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772416623000992" target="_self"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt; that they release microplastics and nanoplastics, which can then be directly inhaled. Unfortunately, plastic straws are extremely prevalent, with about eight million metric tons of plastic &lt;a href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/single-use-plastics-101" target="_self"&gt;found in waterways&lt;/a&gt; each year. Once these straws and other plastics are in the water, they can affect not just the water but also the soil and animals found in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;7. Canned food linings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;BPA was a controversial &lt;a href="https://www.ewg.org/news-insights/news/bpa-update-tracking-canned-food-phaseout" target="_self"&gt;material used&lt;/a&gt; in the manufacturing of canned food linings that could cause serious health effects. Today, non-BPA acrylic or polyester epoxies are more commonly used, but these are not proven safe either, as they too contain microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Kitchen material swaps to reduce microplastics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, you have alternatives. Before putting on your apron, consider adding these items to your kitchen to lower your risk of exposure to microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Wooden or stainless spatulas&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are alternatives to plastic spatulas. Consider trying out a &lt;a href="https://www.earlywooddesigns.com/products/wooden-kitchen-utensil-set" target="_self"&gt;wooden utensil set&lt;/a&gt; or one made from stainless steel. This can significantly reduce your exposure to microplastics while upgrading your used utensils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Wooden or stainless steel utensils&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of plastic utensils, try to use stainless steel utensils that can be better for the body and also the environment. Wooden utensils can also be a great substitute, working as a more eco-friendly option for your kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Glass or stainless steel food containers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can't do much about how restaurants choose to package their food, but you can avoid using them in the future. At home, try to stick to glass, ceramic and stainless steel containers to skip the microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Loose tea leaves and strainers or infusers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tea bags can be filled with plastic, but a safer alternative could be loose tea leaves. Many companies nowadays offer loose tea leaves that can be used with a stainless steel strainer or infuser, which works the same as a tea bag but can be much healthier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Spices in bulk or glass containers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid potential contamination from your spices, switch to glass or ceramic packaging instead. This allows your spices to remain on your shelf without being infused with potentially harmful microplastics that can seep into your food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reusable metal or bamboo straws&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic straws take a toll on both the environment and your body, causing serious issues for both. A better alternative would be metal or bamboo straws that can be washed and reused. Even paper straws are a better alternative than plastic ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-original c-shortcodeImage-hasCaption"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_caption g-inner-spacing-right-small g-text-xxsmall"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reusable metal or bamboo straws are great alternatives to plastic ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Luliia Bondar/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fresh produce or frozen produce&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic linings in canned food can hold microplastics, so to eliminate your exposure, look for foods that are packaged in glass instead. You can also opt to use fresh and frozen foods and produce that skips the packaging altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cast iron, carbon steel or stainless steel cookware&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic cookware is common in many kitchens, but there are alternatives. Products like &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/best-stainless-steel-skillet/" target="_self"&gt;stainless steel skillets&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/best-frying-pan/" target="_self"&gt; frying pans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/kitchen-and-household/lighter-cast-iron-frying-pan-options/" target="_self"&gt;cast iron pans&lt;/a&gt; can all be great ways to upgrade your cookware without risking further exposure to microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microplastics can lurk in our kitchens, hiding in our cookware and utensils and making their way into our food. Though research continues, microplastics have been shown to cause damage to the human body, causing huge concerns over the products we use and the materials used to make them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, hope is not lost. With a few simple changes, you can lessen your exposure to microplastics, thus better protecting your health.

Twenty-five years ago, the gap was much wider: Nearly 13 percent of kids were underweight, while just 3 percent had obesity. Over time, those lines have converged and flipped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;It might feel odd to put obesity in the same bucket as underweight; one has long been seen as a problem of scarcity, the other of excess. But public health experts now define both as forms of malnutrition, which they describe in three dimensions: not enough food, too much of the wrong food, and hidden hunger from micronutrient deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;There’s a silver lining in this crossover: Fewer kids are dangerously thin than two decades ago. That decline really matters, because being underweight can mean stunted height, impaired brain development, weak immunity, and in worst cases, a higher risk of death.

A rare &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131%2819%2930248-7"&gt;randomized trial&lt;/a&gt; at the US National Institutes of Health found that people on ultra-processed diets ate about 500 extra calories per day than those on minimally processed ones. Most other &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-077310"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; show associations between ultra-processed food intake and obesity or poor health, though they can’t prove cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But experts also debate about what counts as ultra-processed. The system used by the UN and many researchers to determine what qualifies as ultra-processed is too broad and sometimes lumps together very different foods. That’s why critics like Nicola Guess &lt;a href="/future-perfect/391795/ultra-processed-foods-science-vegan-meat-rfk-maha"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; the category “borders on useless,” pointing out that it can group together things as different as Oreos, tofu, and homemade soup made with a bouillon cube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Still, the debate over definition doesn’t erase the broader finding: Diets heavy in these calorie-dense, heavily marketed products are consistently linked to worse health outcomes. “This is as close as you can get to a causal relationship [in public health],” said Rafael Pérez-Escamilla, a professor of public health nutrition at Yale University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The other shift in the last 25 years is that kids today are far less active than even a generation ago. In &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/22-11-2019-new-who-led-study-says-majority-of-adolescents-worldwide-are-not-sufficiently-physically-active-putting-their-current-and-future-health-at-risk"&gt;global survey reports&lt;/a&gt;, more than 80 percent of adolescents fail to get the World Health Organization recommended hour of daily exercise — a sedentary shift that makes the impact of poor diets worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The result is a world where no region is untouched, but the picture looks very different depending on where you are. Richer countries like the US (21 percent), Chile (27 percent), and the UAE (21 percent) report strikingly high rates of childhood obesity. In some parts of the Pacific Islands, more than a third of children are obese, a trend linked to growing reliance on imported processed foods over traditional diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But this isn’t universal. In sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, underweight is still more common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That regional picture shows we’re in a patchwork of progress and crisis. Some regions are still battling too little food, others too much of the wrong kind, and many face both at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The drivers of this flip are structural — pricing, marketing, food availability — and that’s where the solutions are, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“Latin American countries are worried that obesity and its consequent chronic disease will bankrupt their health systems,” said Nestle. That concern has pushed governments to act faster than most. Chile’s 2016 warning label law and ad-ban package &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196%2821%2900172-8/fulltext"&gt;cut&lt;/a&gt; purchases of sugary drinks and snacks, and Mexico this year banned junk food in public schools, reshaping choices for 34 million children. “Impact studies show that they work to a considerable extent,” Nestle added. The UK’s soft drinks tax points in the same direction, &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004371"&gt;pushing&lt;/a&gt; companies to reformulate beverages with less sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;By contrast, in the US, the Make America Healthy Again movement has delivered little beyond words. “The MAHA movement is all talk. … The policy document that &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/maha-commission-report-childhood-disease-strategy.html"&gt;came out a few days ago&lt;/a&gt; is essentially saying we’ll have no regulations or policies, we’ll only do research and voluntary guidelines,” said Barry Popkin, a longtime nutrition researcher at University of North Carolina. As &lt;a href="/future-perfect/402470/ultra-processed-foods-labels-fda-maha"&gt;Jess Craig reported previously for Vox&lt;/a&gt;, the Food and Drug Administration’s proposed front-of-package labels are a far cry from the bold stop-sign warnings in Latin America — the kind of measures experts say actually change behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Of course, no single law is going to reverse the obesity curve, and nearly every country has struggled to get a handle on it. But measures like warning labels, soda taxes, and marketing restrictions at least sketch out what a serious policy toolkit could look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;The decline in underweight is worth celebrating. But the rise of obesity, now surpassing it, reframes what malnutrition means in the 21st century. Calories alone are no longer the main problem; it’s the kind of calories children are consuming. We’re now in a world where we’ve partly solved one old crisis, only to stumble into another created by our food system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>vox.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 10:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE5NUk4tYkhnUWc1UnFyTFQ2RjF0MDlKZ29XZWJfX19xbjNEZ2RVdkhxcERNOC1ycmhvNlhYeklxMm41TTgwMFhQeS1SZUt1TEVyZzRXaVNsc1V2eUo5c3pFNlVxbDBLRUxJU0xVei1ET1h6VUFaZnFYZkhnRVM5Zmc</guid></item><item><title>首次出现儿童肥胖多于体重不足的情况- yahoo.com</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/first-time-more-kids-obese-104500193.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Something striking just happened in global nutrition: As of 2025, children worldwide are now more likely to be obese than underweight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/obesity-exceeds-underweight-first-time-among-school-age-children-and-adolescents" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UNICEF’s new Child Nutrition Report;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;UNICEF’s new Child Nutrition Report&lt;/a&gt;, about 9.4 percent of school-age kids (ages 5–19) are living with obesity, compared to 9.2 percent who are underweight. Twenty-five years ago, the gap was much wider: Nearly 13 percent of kids were underweight, while just 3 percent had obesity. Over time, those lines have converged and flipped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It might feel odd to put obesity in the same bucket as underweight; one has long been seen as a problem of scarcity, the other of excess. But public health experts now define both as forms of malnutrition, which they describe in three dimensions: not enough food, too much of the wrong food, and hidden hunger from micronutrient deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There’s a silver lining in this crossover: Fewer kids are dangerously thin than two decades ago. That decline really matters, because being underweight can mean stunted height, impaired brain development, weak immunity, and in worst cases, a higher risk of death. So, the fact that those numbers are falling is genuine progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;But it’s overshadowed by how quickly obesity has surged, with 188 million children now living with it — though where it shows up most varies widely by region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Obesity in children isn’t just about size; it raises risks for Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and even certain cancers later in life.

The new cases come as the U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/as-rfk-steers-us-away-from-vaccines-ny-weighs-setting-its-own-policies" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;advocated for policies that reduce access to vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, including the one for measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="bja89"&gt;Still, city health department spokesperson Chantal Gomez said the vaccination rate for measles is so high in New York City that the five boroughs have herd immunity to the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7jrk5"&gt;Gomez said the two new cases serve as reminders to parents to get their children vaccinated after they turn 1 year old, despite the shifting federal guidelines under the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="4ri3o"&gt;Local health department data shows that 93% of the city’s 2-year-olds are vaccinated for measles.

He said misinformation from the federal government against vaccinations could directly harm New Yorkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="87o10"&gt;“I have great concerns,” said Nash. “This kind of messaging will at best confuse people, at worst mislead them about what they need to be doing, staying up to date with routine vaccines that help protect children, older adults and entire populations from bad outcomes of infections like measles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="ei89l"&gt;Kennedy, earlier this year, abruptly fired every member of a top Centers for Disease Control and Prevention committee that decides how vaccines are administered in the U.S., sparking outrage from the nation’s top health experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="2ma96"&gt;New York City last saw a major measles outbreak in 2019, when hundreds of people in Brooklyn's Orthodox Jewish communities caught the disease. The outbreak prompted former Mayor Bill de Blasio to &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/city-declares-public-health-emergency-as-measles-cases-spike-in-ultra-orthodox-neighborhoods" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;declare a public health emergency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="dop4l"&gt;Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine said it was important for local officials to inform New Yorkers about the safety of the vaccines while Kennedy and other federal officials under Trump question whether they do more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6ei5e"&gt;“I’m really worried about what Robert F Kennedy Jr.’s attack on public health institutions is doing here in New York to confidence in this vaccine,” he said. “There are still pockets of resistance to childhood vaccination.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="35d63"&gt;Earlier this month, Gov. Kathy Hochul issued an executive order that allows pharmacists in the state to administer &lt;a href="https://gothamist.com/news/why-getting-a-covid-shot-in-ny-could-be-a-hassle-this-year" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;COVID vaccines&lt;/a&gt; to anyone seeking a booster shot this fall, following the Trump administration's withdrawal of more than $500 million in funding for mRNA vaccines. The move temporarily ensures New Yorkers can continue to get a jab if they want one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="cbr9v"&gt;“If only we had leadership in Washington that valued life the way we do,” Hochul said during an appearance at the Cornerstone Baptist Church on Sunday. “Also, was not at war with science and actually is discouraging people from getting lifesaving COVID shots … This Sec. Kennedy does not even believe in vaccinations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 10:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOeHNrd1lydUUxb2o0SWtNd2pkSmx5UGRWOUJkbGwxU1E0LVE3eDZsMzNDMjUxeFVqLW54cjNGYWlGUHVwR1R4UWRNTWdQWjdCU0Y5VkFQcjZVY3hHc3k2UFN6aEFlT0lZTDBxWFNoME9UZXlVaU03NnljdWZiMkc2VmtJcC03X0ZfR2ZaMkZ6OTVTcWtNRkNZZGxB</guid></item><item><title>Nitazenes ，比芬太尼更有效，正在纽约出现- Times Union</title><link>https://www.timesunion.com/capitol/article/nitazenes-potent-fentanyl-emerging-new-york-21043553.php</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="rel"&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:-mx40 lg:-mx56 x100vw sm:cw-80 lg:cw-112 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement officials routinely seize multiple types of narcotics and other illicit substances during raids.

Yet as the global drug supply has shifted rapidly, officials have noticed several nitazene compounds cropping up among other illicit substances that are circulating in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are multiple strains of nitazenes, which can range in potency. The type discovered in Long Island last month was around 100 times more powerful than fentanyl, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even though fentanyl remains and will continue to remain the primary driver of overdose deaths and poisonings, what we have found is that a more potent, more powerful class of synthetics, nitazenes, has reemerged onto the synthetic market,” said Frank Tarentino, special agent in charge of the New York Drug Enforcement Administration office. “We’re telling people how dangerous fentanyl is; nitazenes can be 20 times more lethal, 50 times more lethal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug is still relatively unknown, and the extent of its impact on overdoses both in New York and nationally is still unclear. But Tarentino said agents have also discovered the drug, which usually comes pressed into innocuous-looking pills, in areas outside of New York City — including Buffalo and Niagara Falls. Its presence has been slowly growing since at least 2022, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md:pt16 md:sy16 md:bb md:bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class="vh y0 mb0 md:vv md:y100 md:mb16"&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="NTV7ARD" data-large-id="Inline-2" data-unit="hnp-timesunion.com/article_dtc" class="lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that there was a possibility that the drug could spread even further. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a number of different investigations and seizures that indicate this is not just a New York City problem,” Tarentino said. “It is a New York state problem.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rapidly changing, fluid nature of a black market for substances means that new adulterants can quickly seep into any drug supply, often killing for sickening drug users who are unaware the substances have been added to drugs like heroin or cocaine. In recent years, the animal tranquilizer &lt;a href="https://www.timesunion.com/state/article/ny-lawmakers-want-widespread-access-xylazine-17904203.php" data-link="native" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class=""&gt;known as xylazine&lt;/a&gt; entered fentanyl supplies in major cities across the Northeast, causing additional complications for first responders who were treating overdoses that came from more than one substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nitazenes respond to naloxone, the opioid overdose reversal medication, Tarentino said. But because they are more powerful than fentanyl, overdoses in which nitazenes are a factor could be harder to treat with the emergency overdose reversal drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-1" data-large-id="Inline-3" data-unit="hnp-timesunion.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Department of Health spokeswoman Erin Clary said the agency has programs in place to monitor nitazenes and other emerging substances of concern in the drug supply. The substance has been a relatively minor factor in fatal overdoses across the state, listed as a cause of death in just 0.2 percent of deaths thus far, Clary said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clary called the frequency of detection of that drug low and said the most recent incident was confirmed in September 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Illicit drug manufacturing is a global enterprise. Many of the chemical compounds that are precursors are produced in mass quantities in China and then sent to cartels in nations like Mexico that package and finish processing the chemicals, including fentanyl, before they are smuggled into the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those organizations, which Tarentino characterized as “innovative, creative and adaptable” criminal groups, can rapidly evolve to escape government crackdowns on certain substances, quickly turning to new adulterants or synthetics that can evade detection more easily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-2" data-large-id="Inline-4" data-unit="hnp-timesunion.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px pb16 aic lg:f lg:jcc lg:mnh250px lg:pb16 lg:aic"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, users don’t know that they’re ingesting substances like fentanyl, instead purchasing cocaine or methamphetamine.

Published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/02698811251360745" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Journal of Psychopharmacology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, the research used advanced neuroimaging to compare how these cannabis-derived compounds alter patterns of communication and blood flow in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cannabis contains a wide range of bioactive compounds, but two of its most studied constituents are THC and CBD. THC is primarily responsible for the euphoric high associated with cannabis use and exerts its effects through the cannabinoid type 1 receptor, found throughout the brain. It is also approved for medical use in treating symptoms such as nausea in chemotherapy patients, spasticity in multiple sclerosis, and chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, CBD does not produce a high and has a very different pharmacological profile. It interacts with multiple systems in the body but does not strongly bind to cannabinoid receptors. Instead, it has shown promise as a treatment for conditions like epilepsy, anxiety, and psychosis. A pharmaceutical-grade form of CBD, known as Epidiolex, is already approved for certain seizure disorders. Research also suggests CBD may reduce neuroinflammation and protect brain cells in neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is growing interest in how THC and CBD interact when used together. Products like nabiximols, which contain THC and CBD in roughly equal amounts, are already used to treat multiple sclerosis symptoms. These combination treatments are thought to allow for higher THC doses while limiting unwanted side effects, but the mechanisms behind these interactions remain unclear. The new study sought to shed light on this by examining how THC, CBD, and their combination affect brain connectivity and blood flow using non-invasive imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were interested in directly comparing the effects of the two best-known cannabis constituents: cannabidiol (CBD) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),” said study author Diana Cash, an associate professor at King’s College London and director of &lt;a href="https://brain-imaging.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Brain Centre&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CBD, which is non-psychoactive, is often promoted as a treatment for a wide range of issues—from inflammation to stress and insomnia—although the scientific evidence does not always support these claims. THC, on the other hand, is often stigmatized because it is the psychoactive component of cannabis, the one responsible for the ‘high,’ yet it also has recognized therapeutic benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We wanted to investigate how these compounds act alone and in combination, as in ‘nabiximols,’ a licensed medication used to treat pain and spasticity in multiple sclerosis. We used rats as an experimental model but applied clinically relevant brain imaging techniques to measure neural connectivity and blood flow. These kinds of controlled studies are difficult to perform in humans due to ethical and practical challenges, such as prior recreational drug use, but of course, animal research also comes with limitations when translating findings to people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used 48 adult male Sprague Dawley rats divided into four groups. Each group received a single dose of either THC, CBD, a THC:CBD combination, or a placebo. The THC dose was 10 milligrams per kilogram, the CBD dose was 150 milligrams per kilogram, and the combination contained both THC and CBD in a ratio similar to that used in nabiximols. About two hours after administration, the rats were scanned using magnetic resonance imaging to assess two key brain functions: resting-state functional connectivity and cerebral blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Functional connectivity refers to the level of synchrony in activity across different brain regions. It is measured by analyzing patterns in blood oxygenation over time and provides insight into how different parts of the brain communicate. Cerebral blood flow, on the other hand, is a measure of how much blood is reaching different brain areas, serving as a proxy for neural activity and metabolic demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The imaging data were analyzed using a combination of graph theory and statistical modeling. This allowed the researchers to examine both overall brain-wide changes and effects within specific neural networks. They also analyzed tissue samples to measure the concentrations of THC, CBD, and their metabolites in the brain and plasma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most pronounced effects were seen in the THC group. Rats given THC showed widespread increases in functional connectivity across the brain, especially between cortical regions and between the cortex and the hippocampus and striatum. Graph theory analysis revealed that THC increased both the strength and clustering of connections, suggesting more tightly knit communication within and between brain networks. Cerebral blood flow was also significantly elevated in many regions, including the thalamus, striatum, and cingulate cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rats given CBD, in contrast, showed a general reduction in functional connectivity. This reduction was not localized to a specific area but was more diffuse across the brain. Unlike THC, CBD did not produce any significant changes in cerebral blood flow. These results suggest that CBD may have a dampening or calming effect on neural synchrony, which aligns with its potential use in treating anxiety and seizure disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were somewhat surprised that CBD reduced brain connectivity,” Cash told PsyPost. “However, this is not necessarily a negative outcome—it’s possible that THC-induced hyperconnectivity reflects an overstimulated state, whereas CBD may allow the brain to “reset” or relax. This interpretation is speculative, especially since our work was conducted in rats rather than humans, but it is an intriguing possibility.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When THC and CBD were given together, the effects were intermediate. Functional connectivity and cerebral blood flow were both elevated compared to the placebo group, but not to the same degree as with THC alone. Seed-based analyses showed that the combined treatment produced some of the same patterns as THC, such as increased connectivity between the striatum and sensorimotor cortex, but the effects were less robust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the researchers observed that CBD seemed to moderate some of THC’s impact on brain activity. This was evident in both the graph theory metrics and the regional analyses. Increases in connectivity and blood flow were smaller in the combination group than in the THC-only group, even though THC levels in the brain were actually higher in the combination condition. This finding supports the idea that CBD can alter THC’s effects, not just by reducing its absorption or metabolism but by actively influencing brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also used a multivariate statistical approach to identify distinct neural signatures associated with each treatment. This analysis revealed that THC, CBD, and the combination treatment each produced unique patterns across connectivity and blood flow measures. These signatures were consistent enough to differentiate the drug groups and could be useful in future efforts to classify how other cannabis-based compounds affect the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that THC strongly increased both brain connectivity and blood flow, while CBD had no effect on blood flow but significantly reduced connectivity,” Cash explained. “The combination produced an effect somewhat similar to THC, but much weaker—suggesting that CBD can dampen or modulate the effects of THC. This could help explain why traditional cannabis, which contains both compounds, is often reported to produce milder effects compared to newer strains bred for very high THC content.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results are broadly consistent with several previous studies in both animals and humans, though the literature is quite mixed. One striking aspect we noticed is just how heterogeneous the findings in this field are—likely reflecting differences in methods, models, and populations studied.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the findings offer insight into how cannabis compounds affect brain function, there are limitations to consider. The study was conducted in healthy, anesthetized male rats, which means the results may not fully translate to human users or to individuals with medical conditions. The use of anesthesia, although necessary for high-quality imaging, may interact with cannabinoid signaling and affect brain activity in ways that do not occur in awake brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the study only examined the short-term effects of a single dose. Longer-term studies are needed to understand how repeated use of THC, CBD, or their combination might reshape brain networks over time. There is also a need to study female animals and include disease models to better assess the therapeutic potential of these compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research may build on these findings by incorporating additional brain imaging techniques, testing different doses and delivery methods, or examining how other cannabinoids and non-cannabinoid components of cannabis influence brain activity. The researchers note that they are working toward creating a comprehensive database of brain imaging profiles for different drugs. Such a resource could aid in drug development by linking specific brain signatures to therapeutic or side effect profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The biggest limitation is that our experiments were conducted in animals, and the rats were lightly sedated during imaging to minimize stress,” Cash said. “These factors limit direct generalization to humans. Still, one of our main goals was to establish a framework for comparing the brain effects of different compounds, including synthetic cannabinoids and other psychoactive drugs. In that sense, the study provides a valuable blueprint for future work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are currently extending this work by profiling a range of drugs that affect the brain. Ultimately, we aim to build a database of brain signatures using advanced imaging techniques, combined with AI and machine learning, to support drug discovery and the development of new therapeutics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We would like to emphasize the importance of using comparable brain imaging approaches in both animal and human studies, to make results more directly translatable,” Cash added. “Standardization of imaging analysis methods across research groups would also help the field move forward more effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/02698811251360745" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Acute cannabidiol (CBD), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and their mixture (THC:CBD) exert differential effects on brain activity and blood flow in rats: A translational neuroimaging study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Eilidh MacNicol, Michelle Kokkinou, Maria Elisa Serrano Navacerrada, Donna-Michelle Smith, Jennifer Li, Camilla Simmons, Eugene Kim, Michel Mesquita, Loreto Rojo Gonzalez, Tierney Andrews, Sally Loomis, Royston A Gray, Volker Knappertz, Benjamin J Whalley, Andrew C McCreary, Steven CR Williams, David Virley, and Diana Cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 10:06:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxOanoxTFkyRkJjQS00WVpFcGp3NWhIcFdESGMzSFNBSjk3UXU5X1hGYTJhTE1kSWRocFl5LUVDM3htRWEweTZPY3pCbnNmVDcxblNDVFhVOE84cDhjU3RaOUtxeE9VbldCTEhLRHk4NEZWa3pkOXRDSmlJUERRUjRzVTZWdTZucUlkUEdObHpjQkU4NVVobXFTLTBnSmxrcEdPQjNjSVZibFlVczlNMTZaeXpLcmU</guid></item><item><title>加利福尼亚州表示，它不能再信任华盛顿接种新冠疫苗。一场重大战役迫在眉睫-《洛杉矶时报》</title><link>https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-09-15/california-covid-surge-is-peaking-but-the-battle-over-vaccine-access-is-just-beginning</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-element="story-body" class="ct-rich-text-children font-cms-font-brand-text font-normal text-lg leading-7.75 [&amp;amp;_&amp;gt;p]:text-cms-story-body-color-text clearfix mb-10 md:max-w-170 md:mx-auto" data-subscriber-content&gt; &lt;p&gt;California’s late summer COVID surge is showing signs of peaking, but the state’s war with the Trump administration over vaccines is just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus levels in California’s wastewater remain “&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html" target="_blank"&gt;very high&lt;/a&gt;,” according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as they are in much of the country.

Kennedy Jr., have been so dramatic that a number of medical experts and officials now express little to no confidence in two key agencies within that department — the CDC and Food and Drug Administration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key turning point came in June, when Kennedy &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-06-09/rfk-jr-ousts-entire-cdc-vaccine-advisory-committee"&gt;ousted everyone on the&lt;/a&gt; CDC’s respected Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which issues recommendations on who should receive various types of vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their replacements — some of whom have criticized vaccines and spread misinformation, according to the Associated Press — have led officials and other experts in some states to doubt or dismiss the latest CDC guidance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC’s immunization committee “is no longer a trusted source for vaccine guidance,” Dr. Matt Willis, the former public health officer for Marin County, &lt;a class="link" href="https://yourlocalepidemiologistca.substack.com/p/measles-death-covid-hospitalizations" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; on the blog Your Local Epidemiologist in California. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, medical and scientific groups were confident in the CDC’s data analysis and trusted the agency’s vaccine guidelines. And so that guidance informed key matters including which vaccines should be covered by insurance, and professional medical societies were aligned on immunization recommendations, according to Dr. Erica Pan, the director of the California Department of Public Health and state health officer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now what we’re seeing is a divergence,” Pan &lt;a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/JfEbRVAvIys?si=xcamtcNPvT-TMlyG&amp;amp;t=107" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; during a webinar Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California is moving away from the CDC’s guidance and toward recommendations issued by medical groups, such as professional organizations of pediatricians, family physicians, obstetricians and gynecologists. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ll be aligning our immunization recommendations with trusted national medical professional organizations,” rather than the CDC, Pan said, “given the termination of the vaccine experts with that subject matter expertise.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of local health departments, including from Los Angeles, Orange and San Francisco counties, are endorsing the California Department of Public Health’s vaccine guidance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Reuters/Ipsos poll &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/just-1-4-americans-believe-100430636.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly90LmNvLw&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALKrBUlF4BDB4HTa-L-cnjgk279exuLAe0t27Sqi9YjUc7W8QlV8sHi9WmZtttthgPp_ZJfKrn90MGtnJciVKP4pLmi7E5JGb66svGPuCQTrsH8lkIpzdxoPM62yJd9iBPIae3eaS8wL6oKjaECYYWEab6VxR-geePp_mny7HAaD" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that just 1 in 4 Americans believe that the recommendations for fewer vaccines from the Trump administration were based on scientific evidence and facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California, Washington, Oregon and Hawaii have also united to establish the West Coast Health Alliance, which is intended to provide science-based immunization guidance. Pan said the alliance isn’t intended to be a competitor to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, but to evaluate guidance from other professional medical groups “to make recommendations for our states and for our insurers.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already, compared with the CDC, the California Department of Public Health has far more expansive recommendations on who should get the now-available updated COVID vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Covid19Vaccines.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;It recommends&lt;/a&gt; that all adults get vaccinated, as the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.aafp.org/news/media-center/statements/aafp-announces-fall-immunization-recommendations-reaffirming-commitment-to-vaccine-safety-and-public-health.html" target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Family Physicians&lt;/a&gt; recently endorsed; that those who are pregnant get vaccinated, as endorsed by the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/08/acog-releases-updated-maternal-immunization-guidance-covid-influenza-rsv" target="_blank"&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt;; and that the youngest children — ages 6 months to 23 months — get vaccinated, as endorsed by the &lt;a class="link" href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32836" target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California and the pediatricians group also recommend all children with underlying health conditions get vaccinated. They also say any child should be able to get the vaccine if their parents wish. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA, on the other hand, has approved COVID-19 vaccines only for those ages 65 and older, as well as younger individuals with underlying medical conditions. That means non-senior-age adults may need to either talk with a medical provider before they can get vaccinated or “attest” to a pharmacy that they have an underlying medical condition that makes them eligible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC also recently said that it now has “no guidance” on whether pregnant women should get the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts have noted that the guidance is contradictory, given that the CDC also says people who are at risk of severe illness if they get COVID-19 should get vaccinated — and pregnant women are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some states, pharmacy chains are being forced to ask people to bring in a prescription authorizing them to get the COVID-19 vaccine, at least for another week. As of Friday, CVS said that was the case in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, North Carolina, Oregon, Utah and West Virginia, as well as the District of Columbia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC could be poised to make getting a vaccine even more difficult for some Americans. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is weighing a plan to recommend the COVID-19 vaccine only for those ages 75 and older, and instruct younger people to speak with a healthcare provider before they get the vaccine, the Washington Post &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/12/covid-vaccine-child-death-cdc/" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; Friday. That could mean an additional hurdle for even younger seniors to get the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices is expected to meet  Thursday and Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is some indication that vaccine providers are taking an expansive view of who can be inoculated, however. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaiser Permanente unveiled a &lt;a class="link" href="https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/health-wellness/coronavirus-information/vaccine-appointments?kp_shortcut_referrer=kp.org/covidvaccine" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; announcing that its members ages 6 months and older can get the updated COVID vaccine at its facilities at no cost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Vaccination remains one of the safest and most effective ways to help protect against severe illness. This includes children and families whose health would be at risk if they got COVID-19,” Kaiser says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On its site for California members, Kaiser said people don’t need to provide additional documentation to get the vaccine, nor do they need an individual prescription. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official CDC &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/underlying-conditions.html" target="_blank"&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of conditions that could justify getting the vaccine is also extensive, including risk factors like being overweight, physically inactive or having ever smoked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Times reporter visiting a large retail pharmacy was also told that a qualifying reason for a person under the age of 65 to get the COVID-19 vaccine was if they had a family member who was at risk of severe illness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Californians were subjected to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-09-06/vaccine-chaos-even-some-vulnerable-seniors-cant-get-covid-shots-amid-spiking-cases"&gt;tough&lt;/a&gt; eligibility questions in the first days the shots were available. But Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a UC San Francisco infectious diseases expert, said  that everybody he’s talked to recently “seem to have been getting it without problems, which is reassuring to me, because I want to get one, too.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Legislature is also taking action. State lawmakers on Friday &lt;a class="link" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260AB144" target="_blank"&gt;passed&lt;/a&gt; Assembly Bill 144, which would &lt;a class="link" href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billAnalysisClient.xhtml?bill_id=202520260AB144" target="_blank"&gt;allow&lt;/a&gt; the California Department of Public Health to not just rely on the federal government to outline what kinds of vaccines insurance providers are required to cover, but also take into account guidance from professional medical societies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At a time when misinformation is fueling fear and mistrust, we must safeguard the proven standards that keep families and communities healthy,” California Medical Assn. President Dr. Shannon Udovic-Constant said in a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cmadocs.org/newsroom/news/view/ArticleId/50978/CMA-introduces-legislation-to-safeguard-vaccine-access-in-California" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; supporting the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pan &lt;a class="link" href="https://youtu.be/JfEbRVAvIys?si=SyMOd7Mo91uvJtpG&amp;amp;t=313" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; she expects COVID-19 cases to decline statewide by October. Flu and respiratory syncytial virus are expected to begin ramping up by early October, and the combined respiratory viral season is expected to peak at the end of December and the start of January in California. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the changes to vaccine recommendations this year is &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2023-05-03/us-approves-1st-vaccine-for-rsv-after-decades-of-attempts"&gt;that the RSV vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is now recommended for adults as young as 50 who are at increased risk of severe illness, Pan said. Previously, the recommendation was for adults ages 60 to 74 at increased risk for severe illness. All adults ages 75 and older are also recommended to get the RSV vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another disease to watch out for is pertussis, also known as whooping cough. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who is also a physician, &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/SenBillCassidy/status/1966252751400341809" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; on social media Thursday that his state is suffering its worst whooping cough outbreak in 35 years, with 368 cases this year, including two infants who died. “Most hospitalized were not up-to-date on vaccines,” Cassidy wrote. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1AFBVV95cUxOU1I2WmdCeFo5QnUybDFmZVhpdE44YmUxbnhwVUU0Z2E1RmY4akV6ZmpLVlNfZTFyZzBtOFJ3dkppZm1lRFBBU3V4Y3lJcGVvV1NJcktqWXY3VXQ3eGhvbkoteWVoajg0bFk0V2o3Sk13WkZJZE42VEFkVUJUZG5KeVFXc0xDZ2RMUWZiamZFNUhUbE5VQ1pDa0xzTXUydDlCUnNYcGZwQURiRDduX0t6TXc3TTVrVUszUzRsanRWczM3eWxxYWx3a2d6aFZmWjZXMkg1Wg</guid></item><item><title>史坦顿岛官员警告人们对毒品危机的新担忧，包括大象镇静剂- SILive.com</title><link>https://www.silive.com/crime-safety/2025/09/staten-island-officials-warn-about-new-fears-in-drug-crisis-including-elephant-sedative.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OG5UJIRN2ZBXRPDDS3PS6QIYUE"&gt;STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. — Experts on Staten Island and nationwide are warning that drug traffickers are mixing potentially lethal fentanyl with veterinary sedatives — including one powerful enough to immobilize elephants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5GWCC65HVNARBAZGJGZKNJ3S2Q"&gt;Illicit fentanyl, an opioid that, by itself, is 50 to 100 times stronger than heroin, remains a factor in the majority of accidental drug overdoses on Staten Island, in New York City and throughout the United States.

So, I took a dive into the details of statin therapy. I learned that although statins are thought to reduce the chance of a cardiovascular event by up to 50%, the actual reduction is very small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I presented this information to the cardiologist and decided to forego statin therapy, which he endorsed. A better understanding of this difference would be very valuable to your readers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— T.G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear T.G.:&lt;/strong&gt; The amount of absolute risk reduction from a statin in a person without known heart disease depends mostly on a person's absolute risk of heart disease. This depends on the person's risk factors such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol level, smoking status, family history, and other risk factors. (When a person already has known heart disease, then the benefits of a statin are so large that this kind of analysis isn't generally done.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The relative risk reduction from a statin depends on the potency and dose of a statin, but a typically used number is about a relative risk reduction of 20%. (A 50% relative risk reduction isn't achievable with the current medication.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I normally go through this analysis with every patient when considering a statin, and it starts with estimating their absolute risk prior to treatment. There are several calculators to give an estimate; I usually use tinyurl.com/PREVENTCalc and adjust it for any risk factors that are not considered by the calculator. (I should add that some people just have difficulty understanding these numbers and simply ask me about my opinion, which is fine, but I prefer to work collegially.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For example, a 75-year-old man who has a cholesterol of 220 mg/dL and an HDL of 45 mg/dL with a blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg (all of which might be considered "borderline"), the calculator gives an estimated absolute risk of 19.4%. This is the risk of this person developing any kind of obstructive heart disease, including a heart attack or death, during the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;With a statin, a reasonable guess would be a drop of about 20% of the absolute risk (19.4% in this case), meaning a drop to 15.5%. The relative risk reduction is 20%, but the absolute risk reduction for this person is 3.9%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;A second example is a 50-year-old woman with the exact same numbers who has an absolute risk of 3.6%. She would get the same 20% reduction, but this is only a 0.72% drop for a new absolute risk of 2.88%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Clinicians and epidemiologists use another number called the "number needed to treat" (NNT), which is a function of the absolute risk reduction. In the examples above, about 26 75-year-old men would need to be treated for 10 years to prevent a case of heart attack or death, while 139 50-year-old women would need to be treated to prevent one case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The benefit of a statin or any other treatment to reduce heart disease depends on how much risk a person has to begin with. Whether this benefit is "worth it" to any given person depends not only on the absolute benefit, but also on their aversion to medicine and their level of worry about heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The cost of a statin ($5 or $10 a month) isn't a big consideration for most. Serious side effects to statins are rare, but if they occur, there are alternatives.&lt;em&gt;Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 09:02:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1gFBVV95cUxOOWdobmFnd016dTRmRE0tUThxRnhqNDRUY3gxYnhBd0lTNFQyTnJISHlKU2xaVkdDV3V0RS1YLV9hRHFZdmExeU9sLThPUjRXb0RSSzdzZ2lWWU1DbEJBMUMxUDFOOGlWcTZzOFJzS1NmUGVjUEwtN1JJZVpuaHVrdDZfWEFKQjhPUEhidkl0QnZlOE13VzZFQ2Z5dTVna21vMmZCOXZXdC0xaFFOSEFCQlN4bWpjU2RZWUNrVHVFcXAxTjJaVFBkZkN3Q2FOeUxuOGZQTUZ3</guid></item><item><title>南方在子宫切除术方面处于领先地位—特别是对于黑人女性。原因如下。- AJC.com</title><link>https://www.ajc.com/news/2025/09/the-south-leads-in-hysterectomies-especially-for-black-women-heres-why/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;main class="w-full mx-auto pb-24 primary-text-color bg-white c-articleBodyContainer type-story"&gt;&lt;header data-pagezone="article-body" class="bg-primary-black py-8"&gt;&lt;div class="max-w-[750px] px-5 md:mx-auto lg:max-w-[814px] lg:px-0"&gt;&lt;div class="mt-5"&gt;&lt;figure class="group/image relative mb-0 h-full w-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Tanika Valbrun plays with her 4-month-old son, Jasai Kristian Valbru, at home in Lithia Springs.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The latest health craze to hit social media: magnesium lotion.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Magnesium is an essential mineral that the body uses for a number of functions. It has long been thought to help with sleep when taken as an oral supplement, though there is &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/08/05/nx-s1-5060416/sleep-magnesium-supplements" target="_blank"&gt;little scientific evidence&lt;/a&gt; to back up that claim. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Influencers now promote magnesium in lotion form as an elixir for improving sleep as well as for addressing a wide range of problems, including cortisol and insulin imbalance, muscle soreness, fibromyalgia and arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Did you know rubbing magnesium cream on your child's feet can help with sleep?" asks one woman on TikTok who goes by cottagecalderon and who promises that it can help with growing pains and improving mood.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"No midnight leg cramps," says a man on the account tap.the.orange.cart. "It works for me and my wife."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Y'all," says another TikTokker, well over 40ish, "this magnesium lotion and spray is magic in the bottle."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The claim &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Enthusiasts claim that magnesium lotion — specifically applied to feet — can improve sleep. Many also argue it can be applied all over the body to remedy a variety of other health ailments.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People are buying the idea, literally. &lt;a href="https://growthmarketreports.com/report/topical-magnesium-creams-market" target="_blank"&gt;One market research group&lt;/a&gt; estimated the market in 2024 for topical magnesium was more than $400 million.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The evidence &lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There is little proof that magnesium can be absorbed through the skin.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The problem with this is that the skin is a barrier, not a sponge," says &lt;a href="https://connects.catalyst.harvard.edu/Profiles/display/Person/162855" target="_blank"&gt;Nicholas Theodosakis&lt;/a&gt;, a dermatologist and researcher at Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most medications are best delivered orally, which allows for quick absorption into the bloodstream. A few kinds of substances are well suited to absorption through the skin, he says. Often, transdermal patches are used for medications that need to be slowly absorbed over time.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's no evidence that magnesium is in this category.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Theodosakis theorizes that any benefits realized from magnesium lotion are likely from the massage used to apply it or the lotion's moisturizing ingredients. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;" You apply a cream or a lotion or an ointment that contains some active ingredient and, yeah, your skin looks better than maybe some place you didn't apply it," says Theodosakis. "But that's because the cream itself promotes skin health. Anything that comes in like a cream base or an ointment base is just automatically gonna be good for the skin."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The nuance&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of evidence, at least one doctor says if magnesium lotion is working for you — go for it. "I think the risks of applying magnesium to your skin are probably extremely small," says Dr. &lt;a href="https://sleep.hms.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/john-winkelman" target="_blank"&gt;John Winkelman&lt;/a&gt;, a sleep expert at Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says he had at least one patient report using "magnesium butter," for sleep. (" I thought you put that on toast, but no, in fact, you rub it on your legs," says Winkelman.) "She did say magnesium butter was helping."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Winkelman says in matters of sleep especially, placebo can be powerful — and he's not one to discourage whatever safe remedies work for his patients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That said, Winkelman is not planning to recommend it anytime soon. Supplements and related products are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, which leaves consumers vulnerable to buying the lotion without knowing exactly what's in it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For some of the sleep conditions that magnesium lotion supposedly treats, says Winkelman, there are medically proven treatments. Restless legs syndrome, for example — something some influencers say is eased with an application of magnesium lotion — has actual tested medical therapies. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I really don't feel that it's fair to recommend things that I really don't think have been substantiated as effective," says Winkelman. "I'm a big believer in scientific evidence."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Though there is no proof that magnesium lotion promotes sleep or addresses medical problems, experts, including dermatologist Nicholas Theodosakis, agree that magnesium lotion likely won't hurt, except, he says, "in the pocketbook."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;He notes that as a dermatologist, he sees many health fads. "I think it's just the nature of skin," he notes. "It's highly linked to emotional well-being and psychology and culture. Also, you just have quite a lot of it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NPR</author><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigAFBVV95cUxNaUMycDFmR2NUSXNFNjJjRUxjVUcwNFQtcWhWQ3JJQjZJOUdDRVlPaTRDeHl0UnR6Qm9yQjhWRXdnRkVkNXpYX2VZX2QxODlseGpSTDZteFgwaWl6NUFDMHBxMmRPSzNGYmdhOHdmdXlKbjVOcmxzOW9YVkIwZ3ViNg</guid></item><item><title>特朗普政府残酷解散儿科脑肿瘤联盟- statnews.com</title><link>https://www.statnews.com/2025/09/15/pediatric-brain-tumor-consortium-disbanding-funding-trump/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight days before my 12-year-old son Aryeh died from a rare form of brain cancer on March 23, 2023, he slipped into unconsciousness. The following afternoon, my husband and I had a long conversation about end-of-life steps with his dedicated pediatric oncologist at Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem. I almost slipped off my chair from exhaustion. Later, I climbed into bed with my son and napped with him for two hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To our immense surprise, Aryeh woke up that evening after almost 24 hours of unconsciousness. Maybe he was faintly aware of my presence by his side. He lived another week, and during those days he was his inimitable self, chatty and smiley, although he was very weak and sometimes in pain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our last Sabbath together in the hospital was almost peaceful. On Friday night, we made the Sabbath blessing over a cup of grape juice together, and during the day, I read him “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_William_(book_series)" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Just William&lt;/a&gt;” stories when he was awake. If I brought him a cup of water, I called it a “goblet” and addressed him as “m’lud,” and he replied, “thank you, milady.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, that “extra” week with Aryeh almost felt like an unexpected gift. In that time, we were able to talk together, laugh, hug each other, and discuss important questions. A medical clown named Zaza &lt;a href="https://momentmag.com/israeli-medical-clowns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;took him to the Jerusalem aquarium&lt;/a&gt; in her “clownbulance.” Our daughter, Aryeh’s twin sister, played foosball with him and with other children in the pediatric department at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I think a lot about that “gift” of an extra week of Aryeh’s life, and I think about it now, when I read in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/28/well/pediatric-brain-cancer-trial-group.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the New York Times&lt;/a&gt; that the U.S. federal government is halting $4 million per year in funding to &lt;a href="https://www.pbtc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium&lt;/a&gt; (PBTC), an association of 15 academic centers and children’s hospitals founded in 1999. A &lt;a href="https://dctd.cancer.gov/research/networks/pediatric" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;notice on the website of the National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt; announced that the PBTC, which is dedicated to trials of novel treatments for pediatric brain cancer, will not be able to apply for another five-year funding award to continue its funding beyond March 2026.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;According to the Times, the PBTC currently has six active trials; five are related to treatment. &lt;a href="https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/cancer-biology/john-prensner-md-phd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;John Prensner&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatric neuro-oncologist at the University of Michigan quoted in the story, said that “these are early phase trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of novel therapies for pediatric brain cancers — mostly ‘the very highest-risk types’ of these cancers.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My son had been diagnosed with a very rare, malignant, and aggressive type of brain cancer, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-36107-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;APXA&lt;/a&gt; (anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma). From his diagnosis on March 10, 2022, he lived slightly more than a year. During that time, he endured three brain surgeries, multiple bouts of brain and spinal irradiation, several rounds of experimental medication, and numerous hospitalizations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After each treatment, Aryeh said that he would bounce back: “I always do.” Tragically, no targeted medication exists for this type of tumor, because it is so rare and resistant to standard treatments. And so his ability to “bounce back” ended.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That is why early-phase trials conducted by the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium are so crucial for children with rare cancers. The PBTC’s &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2877373/#:~:text=The%20PBTC%20was%20created%20in,Group%20to%20conduct%20definitive%20trials." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; is to “develop and carry out novel phase I, phase II, and pilot trials” of new therapies and “novel treatment delivery technologies,” in children aged up to 21 years with primary tumors of the central nervous system. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Times notes that after two years of rigorous review, a trial was about to begin “for a neurosurgical procedure that would use tiny lasers to deliver heat and destroy tumors in the brain,” led by &lt;a href="https://weillcornell.org/mmsouweidane" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Mark Souweidane&lt;/a&gt;, director of pediatric neurosurgery at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. In speaking to the New York Times, Souweidane decried the loss of the PBTC, in which collaboration between researchers from different disciplines can lead to the cross-fertilization of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because of the disbanding of the PBTC, children with rare brain cancers may be denied the chance to participate in trials of new and promising treatments, such as CAR-T cell therapy, a type of immunotherapy that “&lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/dual-target-car-t-cell-therapy-slows-growth-aggressive-brain-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;shows promise&lt;/a&gt;” for slowing tumor growth in glioblastoma, an aggressive and fast-growing brain cancer. Several patients lived 12 months or longer after receiving the experimental therapy; the median survival rate for recurrent glioblastoma ranges from six to 10 months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2024/11/car-t-brain-cancer.html#:~:text=CAR%2DT%20cells%2C%20or%20chimeric,see%20clear%20evidence%20of%20reversibility.%22" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;one clinical trial at Stanford Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, 11 patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, or &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/brain/patient/diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;DIPG&lt;/a&gt;, were treated with CAR-T cells. This rare brain cancer, in which malignant cells mix with healthy cells in key neurological structures, cannot be removed with surgery, and no effective chemotherapy options exist. Four of the patients in the Stanford trial saw their tumors shrink by half; one participant, named Drew, saw his tumor disappear from brain scans. Drew is still alive four years after his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/neuro-oncology/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/neuonc/noaf039/8024036?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;amp;login=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;a study published in February&lt;/a&gt; led by Souweidane, researchers announced “&lt;a href="https://www.mskcc.org/news/drug-delivery-approach-shows-promise-treating-deadly-brain-tumor-children#:~:text=The%20convection%2Denhanced%20delivery%20system,CED%20for%20DIPG%20in%20Children" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;hopeful&lt;/a&gt;” results from a Phase 1 trial that tested a novel drug delivery technique called &lt;a href="https://braintumorcenter.ucsf.edu/treatment/experimental-diagnostics-therapies/convection-enhanced-delivery" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;convection-enhanced delivery&lt;/a&gt; for DIPG. This method bypasses the blood-brain barrier, which blocks chemotherapy drugs, by directly infusing drugs through a catheter into the brain tumor. Although DIPG typically has a survival rate of eight to 12 months, several children in Souweidane’s trial have lived for &lt;a href="https://www.mskcc.org/news/drug-delivery-approach-shows-promise-treating-deadly-brain-tumor-children#:~:text=The%20convection%2Denhanced%20delivery%20system,CED%20for%20DIPG%20in%20Children" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;more than three years&lt;/a&gt; after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An extra six months, an extra year, a possible lifetime: That’s time that my talented 12-year-old son was denied. In his last months, Aryeh talked enthusiastically about starting middle school with his friends; about his upcoming bar mitzvah, which he began preparing for but didn’t celebrate; and about growing up to become a brain surgeon, “if I get better.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that’s extra time that kids facing similar diagnoses might have had, but probably won’t, thanks to a cruel decision to dismantle the PBTC. The Trump administration, which made the decision, proclaims its “pro-life” bona fides. It does not include children with brain cancer in its bloviated love of life.&lt;/p&gt;

However, the solution might be as simple as using special eye drops two or three times a day.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A retrospective study of 766 patients presented on September 14 at the 43&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; Congress of the European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (ESCRS) [1], found that the majority could read an extra two, three or more lines on the eye chart used for testing near visual acuity (the Jaeger chart) after using specially formulated eye drops. This improvement was sustained for up to two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Giovanna Benozzi, director of the Center for Advanced Research for Presbyopia, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, said: "We conducted this research due to the significant unmet medical need in presbyopia management. Current solutions such as reading glasses or surgical interventions have limitations, including inconvenience, social discomfort, and potential risks or complications. There is a group of presbyopia patients who have limited options besides spectacles, and who are not candidates for surgery; these are our primary focus of interest. We sought to provide robust clinical evidence supporting an innovative pharmacological solution to offer patients a non-invasive, convenient and effective alternative."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eye drops, developed by Dr Benozzi's father, the late Dr Jorge Benozzi of the same centre, contain a combination of two active agents: pilocarpine, a drug that constricts the pupils and contracts the ciliary muscle, which is a muscle controlling the eye's accommodation for seeing objects at varying distances, and diclofenac, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces inflammation and the discomfort that pilocarpine often causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients administered the eye drops twice a day, usually on waking and again approximately six hours later, with an optional third dose if symptoms recurred or additional visual comfort was needed. The group of patients (373 women and 393 men, with an average age of 55) were divided into three groups to receive one of three eye drop formulations. Each formulation had a fixed dose of diclofenac but concentrations of pilocarpine were 1%, 2% and 3%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers assessed the improvement in how well patients could read the Jaeger chart without reading glasses (uncorrected near visual acuity) one hour after the first administration of the drops, and they followed up the patients for two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Benozzi told the Congress: "Our most significant result showed rapid and sustained improvements in near vision for all three concentrations. One hour after having the first drops, patients had an average improvement of 3.45 Jaeger lines. The treatment also improved focus at all distances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Impressively, 99% of 148 patients in the 1% pilocarpine group reached optimal near vision and were able to read two or more extra lines. Approximately 83% of all patients maintained good functional near vision at 12 months. Importantly, no significant adverse events like increased intraocular pressure or retinal detachment were observed."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 2% group, 69% of 248 patients were able to read three or more extra lines on the Jaeger chart, and in the 3% group, 84% of 370 patients could read three or more extra lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The improvement in the patients' vision was sustained for up to two years, with a median duration of 434 days. Adverse side effects were mild, with the most common being temporary dim vision, which occurred in 32% of cases, irritation when the drops were instilled (3.7%) and headache (3.8%). No patients discontinued the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common adverse side effects of pilocarpine can also include eye redness, watery eyes, blurred vision, dim or dark vision, sensitivity to light or problems changing focus between objects, seeing flashes of light or "floaters" in vision, and, in rare cases, detached retinas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Benozzi continued: "Nearly all patients experienced positive improvements in near visual acuity, although the magnitude of the improvement depended on the status of their vision before treatment at baseline. Our study revealed that optimal pilocarpine concentrations could be individualized depending on the baseline severity of presbyopia as assessed by the initial Jaeger scores. Patients with less severe presbyopia responded best to 1% concentrations, while those with more advanced presbyopia required higher 2% or 3% concentrations to achieve significant visual improvement."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She concluded: "These results suggest this combination therapy offers a safe, effective, and well-tolerated alternative to traditional presbyopia management. It significantly reduces dependence on reading glasses, providing a convenient, non-invasive option for patients, although these eye drops may not eliminate the need for glasses in all individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Importantly, this treatment is not intended to replace surgical interventions, but rather to serve as a valuable solution for patients who need safe, effective, and personalised alternatives and seek freedom from the inconvenience of eyewear. Eye care professionals now have an evidence-based pharmacological option that expands the spectrum of presbyopia care beyond glasses and surgery."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the group of patients in this study, Dr Benozzi has other patients who have received the treatment for more than ten years. Dr Benozzi plans further research to measure improvements in patients' quality of life, and to explore the underlying physiological mechanisms of the eye drops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strengths of the study include the large number of patients included and the long follow-up time. It is the first systematic evaluation comparing three different pilocarpine concentrations in combination with diclofenac. A limitation is that it is a retrospective, single-centre study, which could limit the generalizability of the findings and introduce selection bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESCRS President-Elect, Professor Burkhard Dick, chair of the ophthalmology department at the University Eye Hospital Bochum, Germany, was not involved in the research. He commented: "While surgery for age-related near vision loss has advanced, some patients are not candidates. The single-centre retrospective study by Dr Benozzi suggests that eye drops containing pilocarpine and diclofenac may improve near vision for up to two years, but the limited design means the results may not apply to everyone. Long-term pilocarpine use can sometimes cause side effects such as reduced night vision, dimmer vision in low light, eye strain, irritation and, in rare cases, retinal detachment, while prolonged topical NSAID use may pose corneal risks. Broader, long-term, multi-centre studies are needed to confirm safety and effectiveness before this treatment can be widely recommended."&lt;/p&gt;

For me, recovering from a disc injury has meant learning to respect where my body is at right now, rather than jumping straight back into high-intensity cardio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I’ve been looking for more gentle ways to support my cardiovascular health and landed on walking as an ideal low-impact option that still offers significant health benefits, but I’ve struggled to find the time. Many outdoor walking workouts seem to last at least 30 minutes and that simply doesn’t fit into my working day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="360c1b4f-8cfe-4935-b9f7-c05d78203af7-2"&gt;I came across a 16-minute routine that featured seven intervals of brisk walking. To align with the well-established recommendation that everyone should do 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity a week, I increased the intervals to 10 to make a 21-minute workout, which I did daily for seven days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-to-do-the-walking-workout" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-the-walking-workout"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do the walking workout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul id="22f3da81-a148-45a3-b98a-d4d1e4d8cc4d"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Warm-up: 3min leisurely walk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Intervals: 1min steady walk followed by 30sec easy walk, repeated 10 times&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cool-down: 3min leisurely walk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="c94a087d-29f8-46fe-91df-026a414b5059"&gt;Some walking workouts suggest using heart rate zones to guide your effort. But if, like me, you don’t wear a fitness tracker or smartwatch, then you can use a simple scale of one to 10 to judge how hard you feel you’re working (also known as the rate of perceived exertion):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="ac7d22f5-9538-43a8-9de2-174b75319a38"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leisurely: 1-2 effort out of 10&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Easy: 3-5 effort out of 10&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Steady: 6-7 effort out of 10&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fast: 8-10 effort out of 10&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="83537877-e290-4319-9ad3-a98afc4ef2ca"&gt;For this workout, I kept my warm-up and cool-downs between leisurely and easy effort, I did my brisk walk intervals at the higher end of steady effort and slowed down to an easy effort for the rest periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-my-experience-of-this-workout" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-experience-of-this-workout"&gt;&lt;span&gt;My experience of this workout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a id="elk-7092b1a3-504f-4e2a-b832-5f02364b0455" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="it-s-flexible-enough-for-a-busy-schedule-3"&gt;It’s flexible enough for a busy schedule&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="90b937bf-58ce-4e2e-b32b-770f793aae13"&gt;Committing to 21 minutes of moderate movement a day felt manageable with a busy schedule. But the structure of the workout also meant I could adapt it to suit my weekly schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On days when I had more time, I extended the intervals to two minutes, which made for a 30-minute workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-y7nBXQPJNTU8Sssio3hoUo" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-y7nBXQPJNTU8Sssio3hoUo slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On other days, I did eight intervals but added on seven minutes of continuous brisk walking before the cool-down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had to be more mindful and disciplined with my lunch break to slot in this walk, but surprisingly, I still had time to eat lunch and even complete a quick household chore. It just goes to show, you don’t always need hours in the gym to stay active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-a9f9695c-2158-469e-92f6-97cc45a0dd16" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="i-realised-the-benefit-of-a-work-break-3"&gt;I realised the benefit of a work break &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="30eb3374-537a-4a96-9ad2-50b505d34eff"&gt;It’s easy to power through the day without taking a break outdoors, but committing to daily movement to hit the target of 150 minutes of moderate cardio a week forced me to pause work, lace up my shoes and get outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A change of scenery and a hit of fresh autumnal air energized me and left me feeling far less sluggish. In fact, most days I was even able to dodge the dreaded mid-afternoon slump, which felt great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-1346561b-f48b-45da-aa88-1c2da964f6be" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="one-minute-intervals-felt-surprisingly-effective-3"&gt;One-minute intervals felt surprisingly effective&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="d065021f-c5d4-49a5-9fe8-857205b94df1"&gt;Considering I used to complete high-intensity CrossFit workouts, I was skeptical about how effective one-minute walking intervals could be. I don’t wear a fitness watch—preferring to tune into my body—but I noticed that by the last few sets, I was breathing faster and felt noticeably warmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make each interval count, I had to stay focused and push the pace from the start—there was no time for slacking when the work periods were this short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the days I increased the intervals to two minutes, the workout felt most effective because I spent longer at an elevated heart rate, but it still remained a low-impact activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-shop-walking-shoes" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-shop-walking-shoes"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Shop walking shoes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="7ca41fc5-2847-4a0b-80a3-4749b9fdd035"&gt;If you need to upgrade your walking shoes, here are the top three picks from &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;’s guide to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/buying-guides/best-shoes-for-walking" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/buying-guides/best-shoes-for-walking"&gt;best walking shoes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="product-container hero-product-container product-block-no-wrap"&gt;&lt;div class="product-block-row"&gt;&lt;div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="534c6823-56c9-4a99-8aa8-5577208cc456" id="534c6823-56c9-4a99-8aa8-5577208cc456"&gt;
