    &lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, a 49-year-old man visited Dr. Danielle Belardo, a cardiologist, with chest pain. For some time, he had been treating his high cholesterol not with the statin suggested by his doctor, but with berberine and red yeast rice supplements. He had heard they were more natural. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The supplements hadn’t managed his condition — far from it. Belardo discovered that he not only still had high cholesterol, but also had elevated liver enzymes and coronary artery disease so severe that he needed open-heart surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She referred him for the procedure and started him on two medications to bring down his cholesterol, including a statin. She also told him to quit the supplements. A few weeks later, the liver issues resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a time when Americans are buying and taking record amounts of supplements — well over half of adults consume one — some doctors and dietitians are trying to persuade patients to take it easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At her practice in Pasadena, Calif., Belardo often takes a hard line, regularly “de-prescribing” supplements. Last year, she persuaded one patient to stop taking 132 of them, including some to “detox” the kidneys and liver. Marily Oppezzo, an instructor of medicine at Stanford Prevention Research Center and a registered dietitian, said she channels decluttering powerhouse Marie Kondo by asking patients which ones spark “real, evidence-backed joy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wide variety of gummies, pills and powders are categorized as supplements, including vitamins and minerals, compounds like creatine and herbal products such as ashwagandha and kava. Almost all doctors say a few of them have their place; women benefit from taking folic acid, for example, when trying to have a baby. Some people have vitamin or mineral deficiencies that supplements can help address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But supplements can also come with side effects, which patients are sometimes “shocked” to learn about, said Dr. Mitra Rezvani, a hospitalist at Westchester Medical Center in New York. Many are merely uncomfortable — stomach issues, for example. But some are more serious. One paper in The New England Journal of Medicine estimated that supplements are responsible for 23,000 emergency room visits a year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ways doctors broach the issue can vary. Rezvani has had patients list everything they’re taking and explain why, which helps start a discussion about what they should reconsider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Dr. Jen Gunter, an OB-GYN in San Francisco, tries to not push too hard. “The worst thing you can do is make a patient feel like they can’t talk to you,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, when she sees yet another patient taking probiotic supplements, “I’m always like, ‘Well, if those worked, you wouldn’t be coming to see me.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt; Nausea and rashes &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration only lightly regulates supplements, monitoring them less rigorously than drugs and not approving them for safety or effectiveness before they reach the public. Supplements have been found to be mislabeled, in terms of both the ingredients and their concentration. And some mix poorly with certain medications or with one another. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of what some have called “the wild west” nature of the market, it can be difficult to predict adverse side effects. Dr. Pieter Cohen, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who studies supplements, had one 45-year-old patient who developed rashes on her legs and back after starting on an anti-migraine supplement. Cohen suggested she stop taking the supplement, and the rashes went away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gunter worries about Ayurvedic supplements, some of which have been found to include lead, arsenic and mercury. Other doctors watch out for signs of supplement-related liver damage. Last year, researchers at the University of Michigan estimated that 15 million American adults take a supplement that could potentially cause liver toxicity, such as turmeric or red yeast rice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rezvani once treated a 70-year-old woman who had been experiencing nausea, jaundice and dark urine after starting a turmeric supplement, as well as semaglutide, the compound in the medication Ozempic. Rezvani and her team determined the supplement had likely damaged the liver and possibly interacted with the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient stopped taking the supplement. Soon after, her liver function improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="userMessagingInset" class="user-messaging animate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Overlooking underlying issues &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belardo said she understands why her patients turn to supplements. Prominent doctors sell and promote them online. The pharmaceutical and health care industries have left many Americans disillusioned. And some patients feel dismissed at the doctor, leading them to seek out alternative treatments for their pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, people may take a supplement to manage an unwanted symptom, instead of undergoing medical testing that would reveal the root cause of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2021, a 44-year-old woman came to Belardo for an evaluation. During the visit, the patient noted that, on a naturopath’s recommendation, she had been taking an iron supplement to treat anemia and fatigue, but she still felt tired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iron supplement itself didn’t concern Belardo. What did was that the naturopath had not probed the underlying problem. In hopes of figuring it out, Belardo sent the patient to a gastroenterologist, who performed a colonoscopy. The diagnosis: stage IV colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was an extreme version of a type of situation that frustrates her most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Months, if not years, of opportunity for earlier detection and treatment had been lost,” Belardo said, “because her care was reduced to supplement prescriptions.”&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If all childhood immunizations were given separately, it would take 20 visits to get a six-month-old fully vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The more visits, the more appointments, the more follow-up doses that are required, parents – given that lives are complicated and vaccine schedules are complicated – will be less likely to complete all the additional appointments or follow-up visits required,” Schwartz said. “Splitting up will mean that fewer kids will complete the MMR series.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Breaking them up “serves no purpose”, said Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and the co-inventor of a rotavirus vaccine. “We’re already talking about difficulties in affording all of this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Some vaccines, like the diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTaP) shot, are only made together and cannot be broken up. While separate vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella were licensed in the 1960s, only the combined MMR shots are now available for use in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The current MMR shots in the US are made by Merck and GSK. Both companies have &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/06/nx-s1-5563869/cdc-covid-vaccine-recommendation" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; there is no published scientific evidence to support separating the vaccines, and the combination vaccines play an important role in making vaccination easy and inexpensive. Releasing separate vaccines now would require entirely new saline placebo-controlled clinical trials under new Trump administration policies – an “unimaginable” process when safe and effective vaccines already exist, Schwartz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Even if manufacturers were able to create new trials for separate vaccines, it would be “incredibly unethical” to conduct them, said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“You would be exposing, basically, infants to potentially lethal diseases,” she said. No ethics and regulatory board would approve such a trial, and providers and families are unlikely to participate, she added. “Those trials won’t happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;There was another &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/meetings/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; of the CDC’s advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) planned for 22-23 October. It has been indefinitely postponed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s anyone’s guess,” Schwartz said. The ACIP could say they would like to see monovalent vaccines, but there are no monovalent vaccines approved for them to recommend, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the meeting in September, the independent advisers began a discussion of delaying the hepatitis B vaccine, the first of which is currently recommended at birth, but they tabled the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Young children usually receive later hepatitis B doses as part of combination shots – so if that recommendation is changed, the combination vaccines would be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Offit has “no idea” what the vaccine advisers might discuss, he said. “These people are not making decisions based on scientific data, they’re making decisions based on their own sort of anti-vaccine notions – so who knows. Anything can happen.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But, he said, discussions about breaking up MMR specifically were asked and answered by the ACIP more than two decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Offit served on the ACIP from 1998 to 2003, during which time the now-retracted study led by Andrew Wakefield was published and gained attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Wakefield claimed without evidence in the study that there was a potential link too autism between “the combined measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (rather than monovalent measles vaccine)”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A year before the study was published, Wakefield had filed a patent application for a monovalent measles vaccine, though he did not disclose this conflict of interest in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Wakefield argued that the combination shot weakened the immune system and created cascading effects that led to autism. “We had no evidence for any of this,” Offit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The ACIP held a vote on changing the MMR vaccine recommendation soon after the study was published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We obviously all voted no, because there was no evidence that MMR caused autism,” Offit said. There were already epidemiological studies at that time showing no relationship between being autistic and getting vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In September, the ACIP voted to remove the recommendation for the combination MMR and varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, a move that was officially adopted by the CDC last week. The changes are already creating confusion among patients and pediatric offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Let’s not underestimate just how damaging complexity and confusion are for vaccination efforts, for both patients and families and healthcare providers,” Schwartz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Making the process more confusing, expensive and time-consuming is another way to keep kids from being vaccinated, Rasmussen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“By making many of these vaccines monovalent, that’s going to actually just remove access to them, and there won’t be any vaccines at all,” she continued. “Those vaccines will probably still get made, but if a vaccine is sitting on a shelf and not going into somebody’s arm, then it’s worthless, essentially. I think anti-vaxxers love vaccines that sit on shelves.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 12:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFBheU4yQ0FoRURraGJrNF9GYmQ4aVZheDdFNGVmaElFWFpJZ2Y5X0p4MHBNNHU4UjJpLVNqdHFvVTNSQ1l5ejh0aWxtX0VKejUzeFQtRnVUaTl1cUl0UnFEQ0dyZWlNUzhpbm85T19oT1ZlN0xqUUdtaVpCY1N4dw</guid></item><item><title>3种科学支持的避免膝关节置换的方法-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/10/09/strategies-avoid-knee-replacement-surgery/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XODZSKONDFGLFKLOCA65D45L5U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Every year, more than 700,000 Americans undergo knee replacement surgery.

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, adults who develop such disorders are underrepresented in both the research and within treatment settings, leaving a critical gap in understanding the true scope of the problem, said Samantha DeCaro, a psychologist, and the director of clinical outreach and education at the &lt;a href="https://renfrewcenter.com/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7954061" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Renfrew Center&lt;/a&gt;, a national eating disorder treatment center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Midlife adults meet the same diagnostic criteria as younger patients ― struggling with symptoms such as restricting, bingeing or purging,” said DeCaro, who also co-hosts the podcast &lt;a href="https://allbodiesallfoods.podbean.com/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7954061" data-affiliate="true"&gt;&lt;em&gt;All Bodies. All Foods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What sets them apart, however, are the unique life transitions that can trigger or exacerbate body dissatisfaction and disordered eating: menopause, divorce, an ‘empty nest,’ chronic illness, physical changes, and the challenges of aging in an ageist society,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;

Perched on a hill close to a set of railroad tracks, he could memorise all the numbers of the train carriages that sped by at &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;30 mph,&lt;/span&gt; add them up, and provide the correct total sum. What was remarkable about the case was not just his ability to calculate large numbers (and read them on a moving vehicle), but the fact that he could barely eat unassisted or recognise the faces of people he met. The juxtaposition between his supposed arrested development and his numerical facility made his mathematical feats even more impressive. ‘How can you account for it?’ asked the article’s author. The answer took the form of a medical label: the boy was what 19th-century medicine termed an ‘idiot savant’. He possessed an exceptional talent, despite a profound impairment of the mental faculties that affected both his motor and social skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A century after &lt;em&gt;The Review &lt;/em&gt;relayed the prodigious child’s mathematical abilities, trying to understand ‘how they do it’ still drives psychological research into savantism or ‘savant syndrome’ to this day. The SSM Health Treffert Centre in Wisconsin – named after Darold Treffert (1933-2020), one of the leading experts in the field – defines the savant phenomenon as ‘a rare condition in which persons with various developmental disorders, including autistic disorder, have an amazing ability and talent’. Today, savantism is largely comprehended through the lens of &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/psychology/neurodiversity" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;neurodivergence&lt;/a&gt;, since the association between savantism and autism is strong: roughly one in 10 people with autism exhibit some savant skills, while savantism in the absence of autism is much rarer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychological studies by Simon Baron-Cohen and Michael Lombardo, for example, have &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5789212/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;focused&lt;/a&gt; on the neurological basis of ‘systemising’, where exceptional mathematical or musical skills exist among people diagnosed with autism: such people are ‘hypersystemisers’, that is, they are especially good at identifying ‘laws, rules, and/or regularities’. It is believed that their brain’s systemising mechanisms are ‘tuned to very high levels’, making them acutely sensitive to sensory input and also capable of intense attentional focus and rule-learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the past (autism became a diagnostic category only in 1943), the ‘idiot savant’ was a paradox, who confounded categorisation because there was no unified way of comprehending how such exceptional musical and numerical skills might co-exist alongside their polar opposite: profound disability. To use the language of the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;19th century,&lt;/span&gt; how could a person be at once both a ‘genius’ and an ‘idiot’? The savant challenged conventional understandings of how talent was manifested, and who could manifest it, and at the same time upset notions of who might be classed as an ‘idiot’. In the scheme of how intelligence was understood then, the savant was at best otherworldly and at worst a monstrosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The historian Patrick McDonagh &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/liverpool-scholarship-online/book/15444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; that ‘idiocy’ was a highly ambiguous medical term that was nonetheless widely accepted. Perhaps, in part, because it was a boundaried category that fulfilled an important social-symbolic function: namely, it offered a contrast against which modern individuals could define themselves as rational and intelligent, reinforcing their claims to respect and social authority. It also meant that people like that 11-year-old boy who was fascinated with numbers but was nonetheless considered an ‘idiot’ – in the medical parlance of the day – created a contradiction that continues to have implications today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he term ‘idiot savant’ was coined in the 1860s by the French physician and educational reformer Edouard Séguin &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;(1812-80).&lt;/span&gt; While researching the state of education for so-called ‘feeble-minded children’ in the United States (where he became naturalised), Séguin identified a particular type of child who seemed to excel in one skill despite demonstrating significant mental impairment. According to Séguin, these ‘idiot savants’ were specific to the elite classes, which were already characterised by their excessive desire for luxury and lack of useful contribution to society. For Séguin, the idiot savant – ‘Men abnormally developed in one direction … but idiotic in every other respect’ – was the physical embodiment of this uselessness. He wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is from this [wealthier] class almost exclusively that we have musical, mathematical, architectural, and other varieties of the &lt;em&gt;idiot savant&lt;/em&gt;; useless protrusion of a single faculty, accompanied by a wo[e]ful general impotence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a time when the middle classes were grappling with the fear of social degeneration, Séguin’s pejorative comments went beyond medical observation to reflect a broader critical attitude towards the aristocracy, who were viewed as effete, weakened and hypochondriacal. The idiot savant reinforced these class stereotypes: even their talents, no matter how precocious, were useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Séguin’s position was by no means universal. Physicians like John Langdon Down in England argued that cases of ‘idiots savants’ could be found among all classes of society, and that their exceptional talent could (and should) be trained as a way to contribute to society through their art and skills. One of the savants under Langdon Down’s care was James Henry Pullen, who arrived at the Earlswood Asylum in Surrey in 1850 at the age of 15. Unschooled and largely deaf, he had a very restricted vocabulary: what little Pullen could write or say had been taught to him by his family. However, he showed an enthusiasm for drawing and carving; he had been whittling ships from small pieces of firewood from a young age and without any training in carpentry and, after arriving at Earlswood, he was put to work in the carpenter’s shop. Quickly, he became an expert carpenter. He built furniture for the asylum, though his true delight was in fashioning large-scale models of real and imagined ships. Pullen, his caretaker explained, ‘could build exquisite model ships from drawings, and carve with a great deal of skill, who yet could not understand a sentence – who had to have it dissected for him.’ Pullen’s career spanned his &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;66 years&lt;/span&gt; at Earlswood, during which time his ships won numerous prizes and international recognition – including that of Edward, Prince of Wales, who sent him ivory tusks as encouragement to continue producing &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;his art.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;Her caretakers praised her sweet mannerisms and happy demeanour, which fit with the humble values of the time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Langdon Down believed that, by developing their skills, individuals such as Pullen could become both more self-supporting and useful to society. Indeed, such beliefs were the driving motivation behind the education of intellectually disabled individuals in the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;19th century.&lt;/span&gt; Like many other labels used to pathologise behaviour, for example the ‘juvenile delinquent’ and the ‘homosexual’, the creation of the ‘idiot savant’ medical category became crucial in debates about rights and responsibilities in a period characterised by a strong belief in the meritocratic order of society, as a tool to legitimise social difference – and to moralise it too, by invoking the need to be charitable. Pullen’s case illustrates how individual talent, social recognition and institutional benefits could co-exist and shape the lived experience of an individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This dynamic is exemplified in the case of a young talented woman, whose name has been lost to history, permanently resident at the renowned psychiatric hospital &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;La Salpêtrière&lt;/span&gt; in Paris. Born blind and both physically and intellectually disabled, her ‘musical memory and voice’ were a joy both to her and to those who shared their day-to-day lives with her. She was involved in the asylum choir and was responsible for correcting the other members’ voices. Her caretakers praised her sweet mannerisms and happy demeanour, which fit with the humble values of the time: one must not brag about what one is born with, but accept it with grace, and use it for the common good. Her skills were so well known that the contemporary composers Jean-Antoine-Just Géraldy, Franz Liszt and Giacomo Meyerbeer all visited her in person and praised her unique talent. As the asylum director explained, her talent would have warranted a high social status had it not been for the fact that she was highly dependent on others to look after herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;uring the second half of the 19th century, the nature of genius became one of the central debates within the human sciences. In the context of the theory of degeneration, which migrated from natural history to evolutionary theory, and which &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0957154X9300401501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; that civilisation was in decline due to the inheritance of undesirable characteristics, genius became an ambiguous quality: it could either guarantee progress or further contribute to society’s decay. Understanding what genius was and how it emerged became a pressing issue with social consequences. Was genius something that appeared spontaneously, or the product of an individual’s hard efforts? Could it be harnessed and cultivated for the greater good? Less positively, genius had historically been associated with madness in some way, and this posed yet another issue: was genius a pathology? Were people with prodigious abilities actually mad? And what did that mean for those men responsible for the progress of society, who were often classed as geniuses?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three singular authors came to represent each of these questions: the Italian criminologist Cesare Lombroso, the British eugenicist Francis Galton, and the British sexologist Havelock Ellis. Using statistical analysis, Galton claimed that genius was an inherited quality that emerged independently from education. It was for this reason that men of science begot other men of science: genius was handed down. His hereditarian understanding of genius had important implications for the theory of eugenics, which took hold in the early &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;20th century&lt;/span&gt; among thinkers convinced that a better society (or ‘race’) of people might be built by encouraging reproduction between individuals who had exceptional qualities useful to the rest of society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;That his father, grandfather and brother were all drummers was proof of the patient’s apparently innate talent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Lombroso – notorious for his work on criminal anthropology and the creation of criminal ‘types’ based solely on physical features – argued that genius was a pathological condition similar to insanity. For Lombroso, genius was like a pearl: the result of a morbid alteration that produced something beautiful. But the fact that it could be found among criminals confirmed its ultimately sick nature. Finding a middle ground, Ellis proposed that genius was a hereditary trait associated with idiocy (as opposed to madness), whereby one faculty was overdeveloped at the expense of the rest of the proper functioning of the mind and body. By way of example, he cited the excessive clumsiness that geniuses often seemed to exhibit, but the key to understanding the real nature of talent rested, Ellis argued, in the figure of the ‘idiot savant’ rather than the lunatic, thereby placing genius on the same scale as idiocy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, physicians debated whether or not talent ran in the families of savants. Some cited examples of several family members demonstrating the same ability, among them the case of a man permanently resident at the Salpêtrière who, without ever having played an instrument, had the opportunity to pick up a drum and play with great talent. Upon further inspection, it turned out that the other men in his family were all skilled drum players: that his father, grandfather and brother had all been drummers was proof of the patient’s apparently innate talent. Other physicians countered that the appearance of this ability was random, even freakish; leaning into the paradox of the patient, they confirmed that his ability was pathological, while also highlighting its admirable exceptionalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he study of genius was linked to another issue: the problem of precocity. During the 19th and &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;20th centuries,&lt;/span&gt; as studies in the field of child development grew, and the IQ test, which defined intelligence in quantifiable terms, became an increasingly &lt;a href="https://aeon.co/essays/on-the-dark-history-of-intelligence-as-domination" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;common tool&lt;/a&gt; to sort children into categories, two different ‘types’ of age became relevant: chronological and mental. The former referred to the natural passing of time of any individual, with its associated physical changes and growth. Meanwhile, mental age indicated the different skills and behaviours that most individuals reached at a similar point in time, reflecting different stages of mental development. Proper development required a correlation between the two, and any deviation from the norm was pathologised. Precocity and idiocy were two sides of the same coin: a lack of correspondence between the individual’s natural age and their &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;mental age.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paradigmatic example of precocity was the child prodigy. Records of precocious children date back to the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;18th century,&lt;/span&gt; with examples including Mozart and Christian Heinrich Heineken, a prodigious child also known as ‘the infant scholar of Lübeck’, who, in his brief four years of life, could speak fluent German by the age of one, and read different biblical canons at the ages of two and three. However, as Andrea Graus has &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/hop0000192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt;, it wasn’t until the mid-&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;19th century&lt;/span&gt; that the figure of the child prodigy became a more widespread cultural phenomenon. Linked to the emergence of the entertainment industry and also the growth of developmental psychology, these children became subjects of scientific and popular fascination. Parents and managers alike quickly saw the economic benefit they could obtain from such children, and toured them nationally and internationally, in line with a culture of spectacle that drew masses of people to witness ‘freaks’ of nature. The performances of children like the Italian ‘mental calculator’ Vito Mangiamele &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;(1827-97),&lt;/span&gt; the Spanish pianist Pepito Arriola &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;(1895-1954)&lt;/span&gt; or the Polish-born chess player Samuel Reshevsky &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;(1911-92)&lt;/span&gt; attracted large crowds, while they also became subjects of scientific scrutiny as psychologists tried to understand how it was possible for such talent to appear at such a young age. (Their answer? They had a prodigious memory, rather than any kind of creative ability.) The child prodigy embodied contradictory images of genius on the one hand, and mechanistic underdevelopment on the other: the same contrast that appeared in the idiot savant, whose representatives were often infantilised on account of their idiocy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These conflicting understandings came together in one of the most famous examples of savantism in the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;19th century:&lt;/span&gt; the pianist and composer Thomas ‘Blind Tom’ Wiggins. His case stands out for its singularity: Wiggins was Black, born into enslavement, and had both a physical and a mental disability. By the age of five, he demonstrated an exceptional talent for playing the piano and composing his own music, and at eight he began a career playing solo shows. Wiggins was exhibited across the country by his slaveholder (and, later, his manager), and the pamphlets advertising his talent claimed that it was purely natural, a raw material that could be ‘extracted’ for entertainment purposes, and was both fascinating and grotesque in its genius. (The analogy of extraction is not a coincidence: the historian Lindsay J Wright &lt;a href="https://online.ucpress.edu/ncm/article-abstract/47/1/33/197215/Black-Musicality-and-the-Invention-of-Talent-The?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; that Wiggins’s career took place against the backdrop of the Californian Gold Rush.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;One of the explanations put forward to explain Wiggins’s skill directly invoked his Blackness&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, historians of Wiggins’s case have cast doubt on the &lt;em&gt;sui generis&lt;/em&gt; nature of his genius. While the shows emphasised his improvisational skills and ability to copy tunes from a young age as illustrations of his innate talent, historians note that Wiggins received piano lessons and was accompanied by an instructor with whom he practised his own compositions and those of others. Those close to Wiggins also pointed out that he was not an idiot, but rather ‘frantically delighted or bewitched, if you please, over the music he is making or hearing’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiggins attained a celebrity status accessible to only a few during his period. People were mesmerised by his skill. In 1912, a chronicler for &lt;em&gt;The Seattle Star&lt;/em&gt; described it as Wiggins ‘fe[eling] his way through the mazes of the most complex music’ in a way that was superhuman, as though he was touched by God. But others branded it monstrous. The American writer Mark Twain thought him almost demonically possessed; in a letter to &lt;em&gt;The Daily Alta California&lt;/em&gt; in 1869, he wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;All the schooling of a life-time could not teach a man to do this wonderful thing, I suppose – but this, blind, uninstructed idiot of nineteen does it without any trouble. Some archangel, cast out of upper Heaven like another Satan, inhabits this coarse casket … It is not Blind Tom that does these wonderful things and plays this wonderful music – it is the other party.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, a tension existed around the (impossible) figure of this incredibly talented blind Black man who referred to himself in the third person and clapped eccentrically during his performances. In a society that placed social status on an individual’s innate gift, attempts such as Twain’s to ascribe Wiggins’s talent to something else were strategies to explain away phenomena that did not fit the &lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;status quo.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="ld-embed-block-wrapper"&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://youtube.com/embed/V-Qq0o1S4vo" class="ld-embed-block"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;figcaption class="ld-embed-caption"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, one of the explanations put forward to explain Wiggins’s skill directly invoked his Blackness. In the mid-&lt;span class="ld-nowrap"&gt;19th century,&lt;/span&gt; rhythm was understood to be corporeal, not intellectual, linked more to impulse and sensuality than to reason, largely on the grounds of believing that children, idiots and Black people all exhibited an easy appreciation of music, despite their savage, uncivilised natures. In pointedly racial tones, white Americans argued that Black people possessed an ‘innate musicality’, invoking musical ability as a way to perpetuate notions of essential difference. Similarly, Séguin promoted the use of music as a pedagogical tool that might stimulate the senses and develop the attentional focus of idiots, while noting that ‘their taste is of the popular or coloured kind’. Wiggins, a Black disabled man, confirmed these racially skewed ideas on two counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;ince the Enlightenment, when the intellectual order was understood to mirror the social order, talented intellectually disabled individuals posed a problem for understanding the human mind and for naturalising social difference. This is particularly evident in the case of arithmetical ability. Outside of the universitites, it was considered a niche acquisition with little intellectual prestige, restricted mainly to the mercantile sector; but, with the spread of commercialisation, arithmetic became more important and was commonly seen as a marker of the power of reason. Prestigious mathematicians like Carl Friedrich Gauss in Europe and Nathaniel Bowditch in the US, renowned for their prodigious abilities, became symbols of Enlightenment genius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there were other 18th-century figures, like Jedediah Buxton in England and Thomas Fuller, an enslaved African in Virginia, who could neither read nor write but who demonstrated exceptional calculating skills. For Enlightenment men of science, such individuals offered an insight into the workings of the mind while at the same time posing a threat to the order of society. How could men like Buxton and Fuller be paragons of reason if they couldn’t hold a conversation? Their answer leant on the science of mind to explain that savant-like skill signified an exceptionally developed faculty of memory, and was not a real marker of reason. In the developmental theory of the time, memory was one of the first (and therefore less sophisticated) faculties to develop. As a result, these men of science used cognitive difference as a way to legitimise social hierarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;These practices once again denied intellectually disabled people the possibility of creativity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As medical science shifted in the 19th century towards an anatomo-clinical model, explanations for phenomena of the mind became increasingly rooted in the body – specifically, the brain and the nervous system. Idiocy shifted towards being understood as the product of brain lesions or deformities. When it came to the idiot savant, physicians theorised that their talent was due to brain protrusions and an uneven growth of the organ of the mind, in line with phrenological theories that claimed that the brain was divided into separate sections, each representing a distinct quality or ability that could be measured by studying the skull. Wherever possible, autopsies were carried out on the brains of idiot savants to find out if the cerebral tissue could shed more light on their unexpected talent. Some doctors theorised that the idiot savant would lose their special skill if they developed the rest of their brain functions to restore a more balanced state of mind, since their talent was caused by unequal development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These practices once again denied intellectually disabled people the possibility of creativity: their abilities were ascribed instead to a pathology of brain or mind, or else explained away as nothing more than excellent imitation skills. ‘There is no spontaneous invention,’ affirmed the US neurologist Frederick Peterson in 1896: ‘The &lt;em&gt;idiot savants&lt;/em&gt; are mere copyists in music, modelling, designing, or painting.’ Of course, imitation and repetition are central to the development of any skill, but men such as Peterson invoked these behaviours as a way of denying creativity to savants. Since creativity was so tightly linked to the soul, Peterson and his kind reinforced the idea that idiot savants were not fully human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="ld-dropcap"&gt;I&lt;/span&gt;n a groundbreaking paper in 1943, the Austrian-American psychologist Leo Kanner described autism as being characterised by aloneness, a fixation with objects and the repetition of actions (like writing the same word over and over or shaking their head from side to side), as well as a preference for routines and for their surroundings to stay the same. Atypical cases Kanner discussed in his paper included children who could recognise composers and squirm in pleasure at their music by the age of one and a half, count to 100 by the age of two, sing a substantial repertoire before the age of three, and who had a remarkable ability to spell and complete arithmetic as a memory feat by the age of eight. Kanner argued that these children were born with an innate talent and a unique way of looking at the world. At a time when ideas about intellectual disability were opening up to psychoanalytical and social interpretations, Kanner’s description of children with autism gave room for imagination and uniqueness, while still defending the idea that their brains were wired differently, genetically and neurologically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Savantism continues to fascinate us to this day. Even now, when we operate with the more inclusive category of neurodivergence as opposed to pathology, savantism’s rarity and precocity invite interest. We marvel at Stephen Wiltshire’s ability to draw large cityscapes from memory, or at Leslie Lemke’s ability to play a complex piece of music after listening to it just once. But marvelling has itself been problematised as a form of othering. Kim Peek’s exceptional memory skills might have made him the inspiration for &lt;em&gt;Rain Man&lt;/em&gt; (1988), but the film’s portrayal of Raymond Babbitt (Peek’s avatar) as an infantilised incompetent has drawn pointed criticism from the neurodivergent community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;The savant is still a rare curio, even if the neurological context in which we comprehend them has changed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For its part, the disability community has expressed frustration over the cultural over-representation of exceptionally talented autistic figures for creating harmful stereotypes that render invisible those people with disabilities who are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; exceptionally talented. Turning a historical lens on savantism is telling in revealing precisely how at different times we conceive and police ideas about who can be creative in different ways. What becomes evident in the rear-view mirror is that the medical discourse around savantism was not primarily about health, or even the sciences of the mind, but rather about politics and power(lessness).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we no longer brand idiot savants as monstrous, it remains a moot question how far we’ve really come. We still trip over this almost voyeuristic idea of exceptional, unexpected talent that make such figures inexplicable and intriguing. The savant is still a rare curio, even if the neurological context in which we comprehend them has changed. Disability scholars such as Joseph N Straus and Marion Quirici point out that merely by asking how exceptional talent can appear alongside disability, we reproduce social views that present disabled individuals as ‘Others’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the argument cuts two ways. Studies in psychology that comprehend talent as intrinsic to neurodivergent conditions such as autism spectrum disorder have given rise to a popular narrative that sees genius as innate, leading people to speak of disabled savants with so much awe and admiration that they become ‘supercrips’ – people who overcome their disability through their mysterious inborn talent. But this supposedly positive take still styles disabled people as being ‘not like us’. Otherworldly is still Other, and it imposes the need to be ‘more than’ in order to be accepted. As many disability advocates argue, these narratives of overcoming compound the idea that a disability is something negative, while obstructing the discomfiting subversive agency that disabled individuals can tap into through their very existence. To the extent that we still struggle to comprehend neurological complexity, the figure of the ‘idiot savant’ is a reminder that we need to do better at unpicking, processing and accepting difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Aeon</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 10:03:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxQTkFJQ1BtMlVjajN0bEdIeDdvS3JTeFZTekVNOFB2bFVaVlJUbURyLXN1TXdGX2JsWDFJWW5PXzFVTkM0V3VIaWF0azlNRE5fWEVta3lJbGpEdVcwTFZLVTR1Rk9SNDBvMnhRZjNWSFVVRmdNMlVLTGJRS1NDRF9IX3lmNW5ZWTRTSWc</guid></item><item><title>夏季喘息后，禽流感病例再次飙升- NBC新闻</title><link>https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/bird-flu-cases-spiking-rcna235519</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-89fbd0" class="body-graf"&gt;It was a quiet summer for bird flu: Egg prices fell a bit, fewer sick poultry flocks were culled on farms, and officials took a breath. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0739ad" class="body-graf"&gt;“It was lovely,” said Shauna Voss, the assistant director of the Minnesota Board of Animal Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e43535" class="body-graf"&gt;But it didn’t last. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-56e5d8" class="body-graf"&gt;Bird flu is spreading again, now that wild water fowl — geese, ducks and cranes — have begun their seasonal migrations. As the birds travel, they mingle at lakes and ponds and share viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-631cdb" class="body-graf"&gt;In poultry, bird flu cases are spiking earlier than expected. More than 4 million poultry birds have been culled in the last month, in states including Minnesota and Iowa, after members of their flock tested positive for the virus, called H5N1. The trend corresponds to a spike in infections detected among wild birds in northern states.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-fc86c1" class="body-graf"&gt;Some state officials are bracing for a challenging autumn, which is when cases have typically spiked in past years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9adf09" class="body-graf"&gt;“Last week, we had our first confirmed positive,” Iowa Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig said. The case was on a turkey farm in Calhoun County. “The question for us then is how extensive will it be and what kind of fall will we have.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8fb556" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s too early to say what effect the outbreaks will have on egg prices, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a7072b" class="body-graf"&gt;“The only honest answer to that is we will have to see. I wish I could give you more than that,” Naig said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0384be" class="body-graf"&gt;This is the fourth fall in which bird flu infections have risen, a sign the virus is becoming endemic in wild birds and could be a continual threat to poultry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8fc3a3" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s not going away. It seems pretty embedded,” Voss said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-87f1fe" class="body-graf"&gt;The more the virus circulates, there is a risk that it will unlock a way to readily infect humans. If that becomes a problem, some experts fear that the Trump administration’s cuts to mRNA research could hamper scientists’ ability to rapidly develop a new vaccine. For now, though, the health risk to people remains low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8a7726" class="body-graf"&gt;As fall progresses, officials, wildlife experts and virologists are in a watch-and-wait mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aafb3e" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s an interesting time,” said Declan Schroeder, an associate professor of virology at the University of Minnesota’s College of Veterinary Medicine. “Everyone is waiting with bated breath to see what’s going to happen.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="body-hori-rule"&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f49634" class="body-graf"&gt;Avian influenza was first detected in a U.S. commercial flock in February 2022, after circulating in wild birds before then. The virus is almost always deadly for poultry birds, and as of this summer, more than 175 million birds had been culled or killed. Two years ago, researchers were &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/bird-flu-cases-spread-warning-signs-rcna185084" target="_blank"&gt;surprised to discover that bird flu had spread to dairy cows&lt;/a&gt; and was found in raw, unpasteurized milk, prompting a slew of changes to farm practices and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/usda-orders-testing-milk-bird-flu-rcna183212" target="_blank"&gt;milk testing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5aec88" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;At least 70 people&lt;/a&gt; — mostly farmworkers with close contact to birds or cows — have been infected. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/first-human-bird-flu-death-us-louisiana-rcna186466" target="_blank"&gt;One person died&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9ce388" class="body-graf"&gt;Wild birds tend to spread the disease to poultry farms in a few ways, scientists think: through direct contact, by contaminating feed or when workers bring contaminated materials into barns. That’s why migration season can be such a catalyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9f0bea" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you got one sick bird that moves over an area, infects some others, the math suggests it’s going to spread really fast,” said Michael Ward, a professor of natural resources and environmental sciences at the University of Illinois, who studies migration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-14b26b" class="body-graf"&gt;Ward added that habitat limitations are pushing birds to congregate and share space, which makes viral spread more likely. In Illinois, wetland habitat has shrunk as the state deals with drought. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e96945" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s a perfect combination for disease to pop up,” Ward said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-305474" class="body-graf"&gt;In response to an inquiry about the rise in bird flu detections and how the federal government plans to deal with it, the U.S. Department of Agriculture pointed to a &lt;a href="https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/03/20/usda-update-progress-five-pronged-strategy-combat-avian-flu-and-lower-egg-prices" target="_blank"&gt;five-prong strategy it released in February&lt;/a&gt;, which included $100 million for research into new biosecurity measures and vaccine development for poultry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7b2ad3" class="body-graf"&gt;Countries like &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/bird-flu/bird-flu-egg-prices-vaccines-chickens-raw-milk-what-know-rcna193916" target="_blank"&gt;France are already vaccinating poultry birds&lt;/a&gt;, but the USDA said it continues to evaluate whether the U.S. should do so. The agency has not approved such a vaccine, and rolling one out would affect U.S. exports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c222f0" class="body-graf"&gt;“We really do believe that an effective vaccine strategy would be very helpful for the egg and turkey producers, but we understand that has to be carefully done to ensure there’s not an impact to other markets,” Naig, in Iowa, said. “USDA has put some focus on this and now we’re awaiting what that vaccine strategy could look like.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cf57e7" class="body-graf"&gt;Scientists have long been concerned that the bird flu virus might eventually develop the ability to spread effectively between people. Even given the low risk to humans at the moment, Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies infectious diseases, advised people to take basic steps to prevent infection with H5N1 as well as the seasonal flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7565ff" class="body-graf"&gt;“Get your flu shot. Don’t drink raw milk, don’t eat unpasteurized cheese, particularly when cases are circulating.

and a genetic predisposition of susceptibility that leads to the development of Parkinson's disease," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Guy Schwartz, co-director of the Parkinson’s and Movement Disorders Center at Stony Brook Medicine on Long Island, New York, warned that TCE is "ubiquitous" in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;TCE is just one of many chemicals that has been associated with the development of Parkinson's disease.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is present in common, everyday life materials, such as perfumes, cleaning wipes, glue and ink, and in the manufacturing of soap, paper and plastics," Schwartz, who was also not involved in the study, told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It also appears that TCE is present in air and soil, and exposure to it in minute amounts over many years — perhaps over decades — may be necessary to set in motion the biochemical cascade that leads to premature &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/brain-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:death of neurons;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;death of neurons&lt;/a&gt;, as is the case in Parkinson’s disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/newsletters?cmpid=fnfirstnl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Click Here To Sign Up For Our Health Newsletter&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz pointed out, however, that TCE is not the only risk factor to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We shouldn’t discount the possibility that exposure to multiple neurotoxins results in the ‘perfect storm’ leading to disease onset," he said. "Some chemicals are better established than others, and more widely accepted in the medical community, but almost certainly there are others that have not been studied rigorously and potentially are even more deleterious &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:to our health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;to our health&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schwartz noted that the study suggests Parkinson’s disease may be linked not only to advanced age, but also to the cumulative effects of long-term exposure to neurotoxins — which could help explain why the disease often develops later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding TCE exposure can be challenging, Ellenbogen noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is likely some benefit to using medical-grade air purifiers, filtering water and avoiding plastic water bottles, which may contribute to lowering risk," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Previous research has found that TCE, when inhaled or ingested, can easily cross the blood-brain barrier and cause damage to neurons.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher Krzyzanowski encourages individuals to be aware of the &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:previous studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;previous studies&lt;/a&gt; linking TCE exposure to Parkinson’s disease risk and to check to see whether the chemical has contaminated their own community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If so, there are ways to volunteer and get involved with community groups concerning environmental advocacy and remediation," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:For more Health articles, visit ;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;For more Health articles, visit &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.foxnews.com/health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:www.foxnews.com/health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;www.foxnews.com/health&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was supported in part by the American Academy of Neurology and the Barrow Neurological Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fox News Digital reached out to several manufacturers of TCE for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Original article source:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/parkinsons-risk-could-increase-exposure-common-chemical-study-suggests" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parkinson’s risk could increase with exposure to common chemical, study suggests;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parkinson’s risk could increase with exposure to common chemical, study suggests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 09 Oct 2025 08:33:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxNcElfYlpWYkxDT0ZWVTc0QkxRaDNKYXc3MTEyak5ZdjZaOXNHMzJfZUVxZlJYejdZSnVaRTdUZUdrZUdqcTliQUdlVllMZ1RhY1VrcmgxTjlGV2FqZTNQc1luZU1tRGFBYld3NHB0dmhMd09xaUZoV2lRSl9oam9JTUhLNkE</guid></item><item><title>中国一名男子在猪肝移植后存活超过170天，医生报告- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/health/pig-liver-transplant-china</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;
                
    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgick8ve000x27p31vreghde@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors in China say they transplanted a genetically modified pig liver into a 71-year-old man who lived 171 days after the procedure, and 38 of those days were with the pig organ in place – a first to be published in a peer-reviewed journal.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgicv29g00033b6q1y58ckxc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists have had early success transplanting genetically modified pig kidneys and hearts into humans, and pig livers have been transplanted into people who were brain-dead. But experts in the field of xenotransplantation – using animal organs in people – have had some concerns about whether the liver would be a good candidate for such a procedure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgigtkpi0000336nsja8xfki@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Everyone always says, ‘oh, liver is too complicated to transplant, compared to the heart or kidney,’ but after this, in the future, I think people will think differently. I think liver is good if we can get enough human genes in the pig,” said Dr. Beicheng Sun, president of the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University and a co-author of the new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef40002336ncg1z0pse@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Unlike hearts and kidneys that have more narrow functions, the liver is more complicated to replace with a pig organ because it’s large and has a dual blood supply and multiple functions. The liver filters blood, removes toxins and waste, processes nutrients, detoxifies harmful substances like alcohol and drugs, produces bile to help with digestion, produces proteins that help blood clot and plays an important role in regulating blood sugar.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Last year, doctors at &lt;a href="https://www.pennmedicine.org/news/news-releases/2024/january/first-successful-external-liver-perfusion-using-a-porcine-liver" target="_blank"&gt;Penn Medicine&lt;/a&gt; did the world’s first known successful external liver perfusion using a gene-edited pig organ. Blood from a brain-dead patient circulated through a pig liver outside the person’s body. In that case, the pig liver showed no signs of inflammation in the 72 hours it was tested, and the patient’s body remained stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef4000a336nghtl25vv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A transplanted pig liver &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/health/pig-liver-human-transplant-china"&gt;given to a brain-dead patient&lt;/a&gt; in China in March 2024 was removed at their family’s request 10 days after surgery. There had been no signs of immune rejection or accumulation of inflammation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef40003336nlzvtv61h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Experts say the new study, published Thursday in the Journal of Hepatology, suggests that pig-to-human liver transplantation shows promise for use as a bridge to help a human who has a serious liver condition live long enough for enough of their own liver to recover or for a donor human liver to became available.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgigxih90005336na8ie8t0a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In the future, maybe the left side can get a real chance to regenerate, and in that case, we would remove the graft, and that would be enough to support the life, or at least we know we can wait one or two months for a graft from a human that could save his life. I think this is a very key finding,” Sun said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef40004336nnmte972w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With more than 100,000 people on organ transplant waiting lists &lt;a href="https://unos.org/data/#:~:text=Improve.,of%20today%201:00pm%20EDT" target="_blank"&gt;in the US alone&lt;/a&gt; and more than 9,000 waiting for a liver transplant, the demand for human organs far outpaces the supply. Livers are the second biggest need after kidneys, &lt;a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics" target="_blank"&gt;according to the US Health Resources &amp;amp; Services Administration.&lt;/a&gt; Scientists have been exploring alternatives for decades, including using pig organs because of their similarity to human organs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef40005336nl0r450os@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the case described in the new paper, doctors at the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhul Medical University in China transplanted a liver from an 11-month-old pig into a 71-year-old man in May 2024. The pig, a clone, had 10 gene edits to reduce the possibility of infection or rejection of the organ. Doctors also gave the man drugs to suppress his immune system to keep his body from rejecting the foreign organ.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef40006336ncojz3vhi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The man had initially been hospitalized for hepatitis B-related cirrhosis, a condition in which scar tissue replaces healthy tissue, impairing the function of the liver and sometimes leading to liver failure. He also had a large tumor in the right lobe of his liver, but efforts to shrink the tumor with a high concentration of chemotherapy targeted to its blood supply were unsuccessful.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgid4zkn00053b6qmqtyb50m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In some cases like this, surgeons can surgically remove a part of the liver, but the researchers behind the new study said that what was left of the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;man’s liver would probably have been too small to meet his metabolic needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef40007336ne78kkaii@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After almost three weeks in the hospital, the man developed severe abdominal pain, and tests showed that the tumor was in danger of rupturing. Doctors tested family members to see whether they could donate liver tissue, but no one was a good match, so a gene-edited pig liver was considered the only remaining option that could save the man’s life. He and his daughter discussed the experiment with the doctors and agreed to proceed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgihofta000e336nturyge22@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We need to have great respect for this patient and their family,” Sun said. “The patient provides such a special contribution to the field of this science, and we need to be grateful for all of these patients who have made such a big contribution to this field.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Doctors removed the tumor and the transplanted the genetically modified pig liver onto&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;what was left of the man’s liver.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef40009336nuecfnzxo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The transplant seemed successful. Right away, the pig liver turned red, and bile – which helps remove waste products and aids in the absorption of fats – started draining from the external bile duct, with secretion progressively increasing over time. Within the first day, there was a significant increase in other liver function indicators, and there were no initial signs of inflammation or rejection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgide7xv00093b6quy24dri7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There were no signs of acute rejection in the man’s body at day 10 after the surgery, the researchers say. Rather, what remained of the left side of the man’s liver seemed to be performing better than it had pre-surgery. An ultrasound showed that the portal vein, hepatic artery and hepatic vein blood flow in the transplanted pig liver were performing normally.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef4000c336najg95uhe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But by day 25, the patient’s heart started showing progressive signs of stress. Tests on day 28 and 33 showed inflammatory changes related to the transplant, and doctors swapped out some of the immune-weakening drugs. But there were other signs that the transplant wasn’t working as well as it did at first, suggesting that the man had developed a condition called xenotransplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy, in which microscopic blood clots damage small blood vessels and organs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef4000d336nmh98gy7b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On day 37, the man’s blood pressure plummeted and his heart rate increased, and he was in and out of consciousness. At that point, his own liver was considered capable of functioning enough to keep his body going, so doctors removed the pig organ on day 38. The man’s liver continued to function well afterward.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgidvv46000k3b6qwqauez0d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On day 135, the man developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and he died of this bleeding 171 days after the transplant procedure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef4000e336ndzuceb9s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study authors say the research gave them critical insight into the challenges and the feasibility of such a transplant. It showed that pig-to-human liver transplantation “can provide effective hepatic support while preserving part of the native liver, confirming its clinical feasibility as a bridging strategy,” they wrote.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef4000f336nqvpdcevq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Heiner Wedemeyer, a professor and chairman of the Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, Infectious Diseases and Endocrinology at Hannover Medical School in Germany who co-authored an editorial that was published alongside the study Thursday, wrote that the experiment showed “a cause for cautious optimism” as well as a “reminder of how far the field must still travel.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgickef4000g336nnn4ee1zc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s really groundbreaking,” Wedemeyer told CNN. “For me as a transplant hepatologist, it really opens completely new views and ideas.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgih79m8000b336nqz5m4dey@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Wedemeyer said he saw a patient Wednesday morning who had acute liver failure and did not qualify for transplantation with a human organ because of some cancer issues.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmgii4cp0000r3b6qirge4on9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If I would have had, at this stage, use of a pig liver to bridge her – because she may need three, four, five, six, seven weeks to recover with her own liver – I would have done this,” he said. “A pig liver gives us completely new opportunities, and that can really be promising for our patients.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

But beyond its rich aroma and flavour, how you brew your coffee can make a big difference to its health impact. According to researchers from Harvard, certain brewing methods may help you enjoy all the benefits of coffee, such as improved alertness, metabolism, and heart health, while reducing potential risks linked to cholesterol and overconsumption. Among these, filtered coffee stands out as the healthiest option, helping retain coffee’s antioxidants while removing compounds that could otherwise raise LDL cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Coffee’s real health benefits and risks&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many people, coffee is an essential part of the morning routine. However, it has long carried a mixed reputation. Some worry that drinking coffee can lead to restlessness, increased heart rate, or poor sleep. These effects are mainly due to excessive caffeine intake or sugary additions, not the coffee itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When consumed in moderation, coffee can actually offer several health benefits. It contains powerful antioxidants that protect the body’s cells from oxidative stress, a process linked to ageing and chronic diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies suggest that coffee may lower the risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. It also helps improve alertness, focus, and metabolism, making it a great natural energy booster. Additionally, moderate coffee intake has been linked to improved liver function, reduced inflammation, and enhanced mood regulation, contributing to overall mental well-being and long-term metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, balance is key. Too much caffeine can cause jitteriness, anxiety, or disrupted sleep. People sensitive to caffeine should limit intake or avoid drinking it late in the day. Similarly, adding sugar, syrups, or heavy cream can turn a healthy beverage into a high-calorie drink, undoing many of its natural benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Harvard says filtered coffee is the healthiest choice&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/whats-the-healthiest-way-to-brew-coffee?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Harvard Health Publishing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, the healthiest way to drink coffee is by brewing it with a paper filter. This method retains coffee’s beneficial compounds while removing certain oils, known as cafestol and kahweol, that are naturally present in unfiltered coffee. These oils, when consumed regularly, can raise LDL (bad) cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brewing coffee using a drip machine, pour-over, or percolator with a filter helps trap these substances, producing a smoother and healthier drink. In contrast, unfiltered methods such as espresso, French press, or Turkish coffee allow these compounds to pass through, potentially impacting heart health over time. Filtered coffee also reduces the presence of cafestol and kahweol, compounds that can raise cholesterol levels, making it a better choice for regular consumption, especially for individuals concerned about cardiovascular health or managing elevated cholesterol. It’s a simple, effective change that offers long-term benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The best way to enjoy coffee in moderation&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research highlights that moderation is just as important as preparation. Drinking around three to four cups of filtered coffee per day appears to offer the most health benefits without significant drawbacks. This level provides a good balance of antioxidants and energy while minimising the risks associated with too much caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also best to enjoy coffee without heavy cream, sugar, or flavoured syrups. These additions can lead to unnecessary calories, sugar spikes, and inflammation, which counteract the protective effects of coffee’s antioxidants. For a healthier version, try drinking it black, with a splash of milk, or using natural sweeteners like cinnamon or a small amount of honey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Smarter brewing for a healthier cup&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffee can be a nourishing part of a balanced diet when brewed and consumed wisely. Choosing filtered coffee is the easiest way to reduce harmful compounds while keeping the taste and energy boost intact. Pairing this habit with a nutrient-rich diet and proper hydration further enhances coffee’s positive effects on health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if you love your morning cup, there’s no need to give it up, just brew it smarter. Use a paper filter, limit sugar, and enjoy your coffee in moderation. With these small changes, your daily ritual can become a heart-healthy and antioxidant-rich habit that supports your overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

It's a possibility explored in a new study of 20 common bottlenose dolphins (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_bottlenose_dolphin"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tursiops truncatus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) stranded in the Indian River Lagoon, Florida, between 2010 and 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the researchers behind the study have linked the signs of dolphin neurodegeneration to  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/climate-change" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73046" data-postid="176885" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; – via &lt;a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/hazards/hab/"&gt;toxic blooms of algae&lt;/a&gt; and bacteria that are becoming more frequent and widespread in warmer waters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis of the brains of the stranded dolphins revealed changes to gene expression that are associated with Alzheimer's in humans, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-key-alzheimers-pathway-and-blocking-it-reverses-symptoms-in-mice"&gt;damage typical&lt;/a&gt; of the disease, like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/sky-high-levels-of-alzheimers-protein-found-in-newborns"&gt;clumped proteins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/fat-buildup-in-brain-cells-could-provide-new-target-for-alzheimers-treatment"&gt;Fat Buildup in Brain Cells Could Provide New Target For Alzheimer's Treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was a significant difference in the dolphins stranded during algal bloom seasons though: Their brains showed levels of the neurotoxin 2,4-diaminobutyric acid (2,4-DAB) that were a whopping 2,900 times more concentrated than in other dolphins that beached themselves when no algal blooms were around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's evidence of the harmful effects of blooms filled with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyanobacteria"&gt;cyanobacteria&lt;/a&gt;, and it could explain some of the loss of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-navigational-skills-are-intricately-linked-to-your-past-research-shows"&gt;navigational skills&lt;/a&gt; and memory that would lead these dolphins to become stranded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_176888" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176888" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/AlgalBloom.jpg" alt="Algal bloom diagram" class="wp-image-176888 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/AlgalBloom.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/AlgalBloom-600x362.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-176888" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers linked algal blooms with dolphin brain damage. (Durden et al., &lt;em&gt;Comms. Biol.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since dolphins are considered environmental sentinels for toxic exposures in marine environments, there are concerns about human health issues associated with cyanobacterial blooms," &lt;a href="https://brainchemistrylabs.org/news-blog/2025/10/1/do-stranded-dolphins-have-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; toxicologist David Davis, from the University of Miami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For context, it's important to note that dolphins normally develop brain problems that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.15900"&gt;look a lot like Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; as they get older. We also know that toxins given off by cyanobacteria &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hal.2010.05.002"&gt;can harm neurons&lt;/a&gt; in animals and people, though links to human neurodegenerative diseases are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10937404.2017.1297592"&gt;still under investigation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suggestion the team is making now is that these problems might be accelerated and made worse in dolphins &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/exposure-to-algae-toxin-increases-the-risk-of-alzheimers-like-illnesses-52981"&gt;by harmful algal blooms&lt;/a&gt;. The study adds details on the neurotoxins doing the damage, the key consequences in the dolphin brains, and the seasonal variations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The co-occurrence of Alzheimer's disease neuropathological changes and the natural accumulation of algal toxins observed in dolphins allows a unique opportunity to study the impact of these two converging events on the brain," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-08796-0"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risks aren't just limited to dolphins, either: these blooms &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134068"&gt;are causing harm&lt;/a&gt; to plenty of other kinds of marine life, which then has knock-on effects going up the food chain, leading eventually to humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past research has &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/algae-that-can-cause-memory-loss-found-lurking-in-seafood"&gt;already linked&lt;/a&gt; algal blooms to toxins that can lead to memory loss, which is of course a key characteristic of Alzheimer's. If these chemicals get into our food in large enough amounts, that could be a serious problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study looks at dolphins and not humans, but some of the fundamental, Alzheimer's-like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newly-identified-proteins-may-explain-devastating-effects-of-alzheimers"&gt;shifts in the brain&lt;/a&gt; are the same, the researchers note. There's no direct link yet, but the signs are there, and that's at least worthy of further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the same researchers have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0404926101"&gt;previously looked at&lt;/a&gt; cyanobacteria and the neurotoxins they produce in cycad trees, finding that these toxins can persist in the environment and can accumulate up the food chain. That's a potential pathway where exposure to these toxins might lead to different types of neurodegeneration in human beings, including dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although there are likely many paths to Alzheimer's disease, cyanobacterial exposures increasingly appear to be a risk factor," &lt;a href="https://brainchemistrylabs.org/news-blog/2025/10/1/do-stranded-dolphins-have-alzheimers-disease"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-08796-0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Communication Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When humanity ventures out into the final frontier, we won't be alone. &lt;a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/1925483/possible-alien-origins-mysterious-object/" target="_blank"&gt;I'm not talking about extraterrestrial life&lt;/a&gt;, but the Earth-based life that we'll bring with us. Russia returned a research satellite last week that was carrying 75 mice, over 1,500 flies, microorganisms, plant seeds and cell cultures. The Bion-M No. 2 satellite was launched in August to conduct over 30 experiments in low Earth orbit, furthering our understanding of how life functions in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;The mission, a joint effort between Roscosmos and Russia's Institute of Biomedical Problems, concluded with a landing in the steppes of the Orenburg region. &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/space-exploration/russian-noahs-ark-probe-carrying-75-mice-and-1-500-flies-lands-back-on-earth" target="_blank"&gt;According to Space.com,&lt;/a&gt; the descent module was nicknamed Noah's Ark because of how it was stuffed with animal life. The scorching hot capsule sparked a brush fire, but it was quickly extinguished so scientists could retrieve their experiments on-site. Unlike early Soviet spaceflights with animals, most famously Laika, this ark needed to return to Earth with living occupants. Unfortunately, ten mice didn't survive the mission. Specialists assessed whether the flies onboard had sustained damage to their nervous systems after the trip to space.&lt;/p&gt;

				            &lt;div class="columns-holder "&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;While the space zoo would imply that the experiments were conducted solely for animal research, the work done was intended to assist future long-term human space trips. Experiments aimed to develop life support systems that can endure both prolonged weightlessness and cosmic radiation and improve the radiation safety of crewed spacecraft. However, one of the experiments on the spacecraft sought to test the theory of panspermia. The unproven theory posits that all of life on Earth was brought here as bacteria riding asteroids. The experiment itself involved testing whether bacteria on basalt rocks could survive atmospheric re-entry. The results have yet to be revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spaceflight may never be boring, but it's in a rough place at the moment. Roscosmos is a shadow of its former self, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine &lt;a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/1842246/us-blocks-countries-rival-moon-base-project-china-claim/" target="_blank"&gt;crushing the country's ability to collaborate&lt;/a&gt; with Western institutions. The race to return to the Moon is quickly becoming a one-horse affair as &lt;a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/1855263/trump-6-billion-nasa-funding-cut-jeopardizes-china-moon-race/" target="_blank"&gt;the Trump administration has laid off thousands of NASA's employees and canceled already paid-for missions.&lt;/a&gt; The China Manned Space Agency is now positioned to be the first to establish a permanent human presence on the Moon, immediately making China the world's preeminent space power.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

    
&lt;/article&gt;

But a virus currently surging in the Bay Area is one many people may not be aware of: enterovirus D68. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from Stanford University’s wastewater monitoring program show &lt;a href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/?selectedLocation=%7B%22label%22%3A%22San%20Jose,%20CA%22,%22level%22%3A%22plant%22,%22value%22%3A%22c8d357b9%22%7D&amp;amp;plantId=c8d357b9&amp;amp;charts=CjEQACABSABaBUVWRDY4cgoyMDI1LTA4LTI3cgoyMDI1LTEwLTA4igEGM2Y2NTBmwAEB&amp;amp;selectedChartId=3f650f&amp;amp;locationExpanded=true&amp;amp;target=EVD68" data-link="native" class=""&gt;high levels&lt;/a&gt; of enterovirus D68 in San Jose and parts of San Francisco. This RNA respiratory virus is known to cause &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/about/about-enterovirus-d68.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;respiratory&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=enteroviruses-in-children-160-63" data-link="native" class=""&gt;gastrointestinal&lt;/a&gt; and in some rare cases neurological symptoms, including meningitis and polio-like muscle weakness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the spike isn’t unusual. A mix of enteroviruses is known to spread every year, primarily in the late summer and early fall, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/index.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease physician at UCSF, told SFGATE that most people end up with cases that are mild and include runny nose and cough. In some rare cases, the virus can infect the protective covering around the spinal cord and brain, causing meningitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We see a lot of patients in the hospital who come in, they’ll have a headache, will do a lumbar puncture … and they’ll actually have enterovirus in there,” Gandhi said. She explained that when people develop meningitis related to enterovirus it is often much more mild than bacterial meningitis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re “totally functional, you know, but they’ll have a mild headache,” Gandhi said of these patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with severe symptoms can end up hospitalized for respiratory therapy. One especially frightening effect of enterovirus D68 is a potentially dangerous neurological condition called acute flaccid myelitis. In this case, the person affected, usually a child, develops serious &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/enterovirus/spread-enterovirus-d68-linked-polio-illness-may-have-risen-50-over-10-years" data-link="native" class=""&gt;“polio-like” symptoms&lt;/a&gt;, including muscle weakness that can lead to permanent paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can be very scary, but it’s very rare,” Gandhi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no vaccine to protect against the enterovirus D68 and no cure.

&lt;p&gt;And what about the lungs? A number of things could explain the problems in his lungs—including infections from soil bacteria he might encounter in his construction work or a parasitic infection found in Central America. But the cause that best fit was common pneumonia and, more specifically, based on the distribution of opacities in his lung, pneumonia caused by aspiration (inhaling food particles or other things that are not air)—which is something that can happen when people drink excessive amounts of alcohol, as the man regularly did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Ethanol impairs consciousness and blunts protective reflexes (e.g., cough and gag), which disrupts the normal control mechanisms of the upper aerodigestive tract," Dhaliwal noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is where Dhaliwal made a critical connection. If the man's drinking led him to develop aspiration pneumonia—accidentally getting food in his lungs—he may have also accidentally gotten nonfood in this gastrointestinal tract at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Critical connection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The things people most commonly swallow by accident include coins, button batteries, jewelry, and small bones. But these things tend to show up in imaging, and none of the imaging revealed a swallowed object. Things that don't show up on images, though, are things made of plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This reasoning leads to the search for an organic object that might be ingested while eating and drinking and is seemingly harmless but becomes invasive upon entering the gastrointestinal tract," Dhaliwal wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The leading suspect," he concluded, "is a wooden toothpick—an object commonly found in club sandwiches and used for dental hygiene. Toothpick ingestions often go unnoticed, but once identified, they are considered medical emergencies owing to their propensity to cause visceral perforation and vascular injury."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a toothpick had pierced the man's duodenum, it would completely explain of all the man's symptoms. He drank too much and lost control of his aerodigestive tract, leading to aspiration that caused pneumonia, and he then swallowed a toothpick, which perforated the duodenum and led to sepsis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dhaliwal recommended an endoscopic procedure to look for a toothpick in his intestines. On the man's third day in the hospital, he had the procedure, and, sure enough, there was a toothpick, piercing through his duodenum and into his right kidney, just as Dhaliwal had deduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors promptly removed it and treated the man with antibiotics. He went on to make a full recovery. At a nine-month follow-up, he continued to do well and had maintained abstinence from alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MISSOURI, USA — Three people have died and 15 have been hospitalized by &lt;a href="/article/news/nation-world/west-nile-virus-cases-running-higher-than-normal-health-warnings/507-4a4e49c2-26df-4375-aae6-508e755f266f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;West Nile Virus in Missouri&lt;/a&gt; as of Oct. 4, according to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 16 cases have been confirmed in the state, but more are under investigation. Health officials said virus levels are the highest the state has seen in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus is surging throughout the state and across the country, with &lt;a href="/article/news/nation-world/west-nile-virus-cases-running-higher-than-normal-health-warnings/507-4a4e49c2-26df-4375-aae6-508e755f266f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;cases running 40% higher than normal nationwide&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 770 cases, including 490 severe cases, were identified in early September, compared with the 550 cases, including 350 severe cases, usually reported during this time of year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“West Nile virus is a serious public health concern, and this year’s increase in cases is a reminder that we must remain vigilant,” said Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services State Epidemiologist George Turabelidze said in a press release on Wednesday. “We are asking all Missourians to take simple but effective steps to protect themselves and their families.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said West Nile Virus infections often cause no symptoms, but 1 in 5 people may develop a flu-like illness along with fever, headache, and body aches. Older individuals or people with weakened immune systems can also experience brain swelling or paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department shared the following ways people can protect themselves from the virus, including:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

The symptoms are uncomfortable, and they can come for you &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/colds"&gt;multiple times&lt;/a&gt; a year. If you’re lucky enough to not get &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;sick, you get the unique misery of getting all your normal work done while buried under a mountain of tissues and the mental refrain &lt;em&gt;How did I ever forget how wonderful life is when you don’t have a runny nose? &lt;/em&gt;The common cold isn’t just a nuisance, though. It carries significant economic effects, causing an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/215118"&gt;estimated $40 billion in losses&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. each year from health care costs and missed work days. And for many people with underlying respiratory illnesses like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, aka COPD, it poses a serious threat in the same way that flu, COVID, and pneumonia are more deadly in vulnerable populations.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8y9001n3b78img45pup@published"&gt;Despite regularly meeting the cold on the front lines, we have relatively few weapons to fight it. There’s a litany of cough syrups, but &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40272-020-00420-4"&gt;many are outright ineffective&lt;/a&gt;. Vitamin C &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/nutrition/myths-and-truths-about-vitamin-c"&gt;shorten the length&lt;/a&gt; of a cold, but it won’t prevent one. Antibiotics do nothing to fight viruses (and they do lead to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/well/antibiotic-resistance.html"&gt;antibacterial resistance&lt;/a&gt;). And, of course, there’s no cold vaccine, while you can go get a protective flu or COVID jab when fall weather rolls around. All you can really do is wash your hands a lot and prepare to grit your teeth through the eventual infection.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="81" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8y9001o3b78rp3likn0@published"&gt;Why are we so ill-prepared for the common cold? It’s not because the common cold has been neglected by scientists or vaccine manufacturers, but because it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/oct/06/why-cant-we-cure-the-common-cold"&gt;actually a really wily opponent&lt;/a&gt;. If researchers in the field “thought that a vaccine was something that could be achieved, they would already have done it,” says Sebastian Johnston, a professor of respiratory medicine and allergy at the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College London and a world expert in respiratory medicine research.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="40" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8ya001p3b780wsqwbz2@published"&gt;For the past 18 years, Johnston has been working on achieving exactly that. And he thinks we’re close(ish) to the next step. I reached out to him to learn the latest. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="21" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8ya001q3b7837vugs5a@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slate: Can you give us a little background as to why the common cold is a particularly difficult nut to crack?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="54" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8ya001r3b781qs4pbon@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sebastian Johnston:&lt;/strong&gt; The basic reason is the sheer number of different viruses that cause common colds. Pretty much any respiratory virus can cause a common cold. Some of those already do have vaccines, like influenza, COVID, and RSV. But they’re generally reserved for more vulnerable populations, like older people and people with comorbid conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8ya001s3b782fy2wz48@published"&gt;While any respiratory virus can cause a common cold, the biggest family are rhinoviruses—I would say probably three-quarters to four-fifths of common colds are caused by a rhinovirus infection. And the reason there is not a rhinovirus vaccine is because there are about 180 different rhinoviruses circulating, and they’re all distinct from each other. To get a vaccine that covers 180 different viruses is technologically extremely challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="11" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yb001t3b78mdwj4twm@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How have you been tackling that challenge in your own research?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yb001u3b78i1rfy850@published"&gt;Our aim has been to develop a vaccine that works through T-cells rather than antibodies. Humans have multiple arms of our immune systems that protect us against infections. Antibodies are very important, and producing antibodies against individual viruses is probably the most important thing that protects us against infections. But the problem with antibodies for rhinoviruses is that they don’t cross-react from one virus to another, so you’d need a vaccine with 180 different virus proteins in it to produce an effective antibody-producing virus.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yb001v3b787bocssg5@published"&gt;Then there are T cells, which are also part of the cellular immune response to infection. They have antiviral activity by themselves, but they also promote antibody production by stimulating the cells that produce antibodies. [We found that] if we promoted T-cell responses against rhinoviruses, that &lt;em&gt;would &lt;/em&gt;cross-react among all 180 different rhinoviruses, and they would both have antiviral activity through the T cells themselves and also boost antibody production against those viruses through the T cells.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="10" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yb001w3b783j2ckttt@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sounds like a good idea to me! Has it worked?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  




  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yb001x3b785yfr5wyt@published"&gt;What we’ve shown in mice and monkeys is that you can induce T-cell immune responses to a broad range of rhinoviruses—we’ve studied about 20 of them, which are pretty representative of the entire 180—and get very strong immune responses. We boost antibody production, and we clear virus faster. So everything that we’re seeing in mice and monkeys is telling us that it ought to work in man. But we haven’t yet shown that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="4" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yc001y3b787x07p9ox@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will that entail?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="156" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yc001z3b78zja510sd@published"&gt;We’re working with &lt;a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/247454/apollo-therapeutics-raises-2265m-develop-medicines/"&gt;Apollo Therapeutics&lt;/a&gt;, who are committed to going into safety testing and then seeing whether it works in people by doing clinical trials. We hope that those studies will start later this year or early next year. We’re going to start with people with a chronic lung disease called COPD, because when they get a rhinovirus infection, they frequently end up in hospital, and so the cost [to the health care system] is obviously much higher than people getting common colds. If it’s successful in COPD, we would probably then broaden it to other chronic respiratory diseases like asthma and other chronic lung diseases. If it’s successful in those, we’ll probably broaden it to older people and immunosuppressed populations. And eventually, if it’s very safe and the cost has come down sufficiently to justify using it for the common cold, I see no reason why it shouldn’t eventually be used for the common cold.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="7" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yd00203b780ks2icbj@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any idea how long that could take?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yd00213b7858lbupy4@published"&gt;Once Apollo has done their safety tests, they would then commit to testing whether it works or not, and we would probably look to get an answer a couple of years down the line. They’re quite long-duration studies, because you have to wait for naturally occurring colds to happen in the population that you’re studying. And then from there it usually does take some years to manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="28" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yd00223b78o3gslxx6@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic gave a huge push to mRNA technology research over the last several years. Has that sped up the prospect of a rhinovirus vaccine at all?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yd00233b78tvvb7b7r@published"&gt;It did give a boost. But it hasn’t changed what we’re doing in any major way. We did look at developing an mRNA vaccine for rhinoviruses, but in the end, we decided to go with a protein vaccine with an adjuvant. That’s the standard approach for most vaccines, because the antibody responses that you get are actually stronger with a protein and an adjuvant than with an mRNA.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="26" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yd00243b7865lm5zlo@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re based in the UK, but I’m sure you’ve heard about the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/09/covid-vaccine-flu-shots-2025-florida-new-york-robert-f-kennedy-jr.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;attack on vaccines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; happening across the pond. Has that affected your work at all?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="84" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yd00253b78fgq9vi9j@published"&gt;It hasn’t touched the UK in the same way, but a lot of drug development occurs in the United States, and a lot of clinical trial centers are in the United States, so I expect it has impacted Apollo’s thinking about where they want to do their studies. Obviously we don’t consider it to be a good thing. But there’s not much we can do to influence it at the moment, other than provide good data showing that it works. That’s the best answer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="50" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8ye00273b782zfdv5kc@published"&gt;Developing antivirals is something that many companies have tried, but so far, there is not a rhinovirus antiviral that is licensed and available for use. There was one that got quite a long way, but unfortunately it was found to interact with other drugs, and ultimately it was not approved.&lt;/p&gt;

  
  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="101" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8ye00283b783d74ppoa@published"&gt;There is another drug called &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/altesa-biosciences-details-positive-topline-vapendavir-results-from-phase-2-placebo-controlled-rhinovirus-challenge-study-in-copd-patients-302448650.html"&gt;Vapendavir&lt;/a&gt; that looks promising. We recently carried out a study giving rhinovirus infection to people with COPD to induce a worsening of their COPD—so, mimicking the attacks that happen in the natural setting—and I’m happy to say that it gave positive results. We reduced symptom severity; we sped up time to recovery; we reduced virus loads; we showed reduced inflammation in markers of inflammation in the blood; and we improved lung function. So all of those were positive outcomes, and the company that licensed it is currently looking for investment to do a large clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmgick8yf002a3b78jxrdiibk@published"&gt;To be honest, I do nothing. I’m lucky that I’ve got, I think, good antiviral immunity—most of my colds are mild. But if I had a significant cold, I’d take some &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/paracetamol.html"&gt;paracetamol&lt;/a&gt;. And if I were a vulnerable person who got ill, I would take &lt;a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/news/2024/07/overcounter-nasal-sprays-could-keep-colds-and-flu-at-bay-study-finds.page"&gt;First Defence&lt;/a&gt;, or one of those sprays that has been shown to shorten the illness duration by about a day, because that’s better than another day being ill.&lt;/p&gt;

I started off pretty skeptical about echinacea, but actually, I’m an author on studies showing that echinacea &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40001-021-00499-6"&gt;reduces antibiotic usage by about 70 percent in children&lt;/a&gt; if they use it as a prophylaxis. Antibiotic use is driven largely by common colds, which produce secondary bacterial things like sore throat, earache, nasal congestion, sinusitis.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to strengthening the muscles, lungs, and heart, regular physical exercise also strengthens the immune system. This finding comes from a study of older adults with a history of endurance training, which involves prolonged physical activity such as long-distance running, cycling, swimming, rowing, and walking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;An international team of researchers analyzed the defense cells of these individuals and found that "natural killer" cells, which patrol the body against viruses and diseased cells, were more adaptable, less inflammatory, and metabolically more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-06057-y" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/i&gt;, investigated natural killer (NK) cells. NK cells are a type of white blood cell (lymphocyte) that can destroy infected and diseased cells, including cancer cells. They are at the forefront of the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; because they detect and fight viruses and other pathogens. The researchers analyzed the cells of nine individuals with an average age of 64, divided into two groups: untrained and trained in endurance exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In a previous study, we found that obesity and a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/sedentary+lifestyle/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;sedentary lifestyle&lt;/a&gt; can trigger a process of premature aging of defense cells. This made us want to investigate the other side of the story; that is, whether an older adult who has been practicing endurance exercises for more than 20 years may have a better-prepared immune system. And that's indeed what we found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In these individuals, NK cells functioned better in the face of an inflammatory challenge, in addition to using energy more efficiently. Therefore, it's as if exercise also trains the immune system," says Luciele Minuzzi, a visiting researcher at Justus Liebig University Giessen (JLU) in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study is the result of Minuzzi's postdoctoral research and is part of a larger research project led by São Paulo State University (UNESP) researchers in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the study's findings, regular endurance training modulates the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/inflammatory+response/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;inflammatory response&lt;/a&gt; over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"When we compared the cells of trained older adults with those of non-athletes of the same age, we found that those with a history of endurance exercise had fewer inflammatory markers and more anti-inflammatory markers. This means that compared to non-athletic older adults, they had much better control of inflammation," says Fábio Lira, a professor at the Faculty of Science and Technology (FCT-UNESP), Presidente Prudente campus, and project coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lira points out that the immune system can be influenced by several factors, such as sleep quality, diet, and vaccination, as well as stress, a sedentary lifestyle, and the use of immunosuppressive drugs, which reduce the activity of defense cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Physical exercise is one of these factors that can benefit the immune system, and in this research project, we're investigating how it can modulate the immune response over time," he says.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Changes in the cell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to analyzing the phenotype, function, and mitochondrial metabolism of NK cells in response to inflammatory stimuli, the researchers exposed expanded NK cells from trained and untrained older adults to different pharmacological blockers, such as propranolol and rapamycin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Trained older individuals demonstrate more efficient and adaptable immunity, with greater metabolic control and less propensity for cellular exhaustion. Regular physical exercise appears to positively modulate both adrenergic sensitivity and cellular energy sensors, promoting a more balanced and less inflammatory response to external stimuli," says Minuzzi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Propranolol is a drug that blocks the adrenergic pathway, the neural and endocrine circuit that releases neurotransmitters such as adrenaline and noradrenaline. It was used to isolate the role of this activation/mobilization pathway in NK cells. Rapamycin, on the other hand, inhibits the mTORC1 signaling pathway, which is related to the control of cell growth and proliferation. In the study, rapamycin altered the phenotype of NK cells and decreased their expansion in vitro at high doses (100 ng/mL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In both cases, even with the blocking of signaling pathways, the NK cells of the trained older adults were able to maintain their immune function, while the cells of the untrained individuals showed cellular exhaustion or failure in the inflammatory response. This means that long-term endurance training is associated with protective 'immunometabolic' adaptations in NK cells in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In other words, the cells become more mature and effective, less senescent, and metabolically better prepared to respond to inflammatory or pharmacological stressors," says Minuzzi.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Inflammatory response&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2025.1601405/full" target="_blank"&gt;another recent study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;i&gt;Frontiers in Immunology&lt;/i&gt;, the same group of researchers had compared the immune response of young and master athletes before and after an acute exercise session. To do this, they analyzed whole blood and PBMC (the mononuclear fraction of blood formed by lymphocytes and monocytes, which includes NK cells) data from 12 master athletes (with an average age of 52 and more than 20 years of continuous training) and compared it with data from young athletes (with an average age of 22 and more than four years dedicated to training).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the master athletes had a more controlled inflammatory response than the younger athletes. When their blood cells were stimulated with a pathogen (LPS), both groups produced more IL-6, a cytokine that signals inflammation. However, the increase was more pronounced in young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Another important inflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, was only increased in the younger group," says the researcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/young+athletes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;young athletes&lt;/a&gt; showed a more intense inflammatory response, while the older athletes showed a more regulated and controlled profile. According to the researchers, this suggests that lifelong training can promote beneficial, balanced immune adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Because they train regularly, their bodies are accustomed to dealing with inflammatory episodes, which require more intense stimuli to generate significant long-term inflammatory responses. It's this type of 'training' that—over time—adapts the immune system, making it stronger," she explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Minuzzi points out that research on immune cells in athletes with a long training history has once again shown that decades of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; seem to "train" the regulation of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The system doesn't stop responding, but it avoids exaggeration. This is particularly interesting for a greater understanding of healthy aging since disordered inflammatory responses are linked to several chronic diseases," she concludes.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NCDHHS) has reported the state's first flu-related death of the season.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the NCDHHS said an adult in western North Carolina died from flu complications during the first week of October. Their name was not given in a release.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;"This is a sad reminder that flu infections can be serious and, in some cases, even fatal," said State Epidemiologist Zack Moore, M.D, MPH. "We encourage everyone to take preventative measures against flu and other respiratory illnesses like getting your yearly flu shot, regularly washing hands, covering your cough and staying home when sick to avoid infecting others."&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;More people died from the flu and flu complications during the 2024-2025 season than any previous stretch since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. From Oct. 5, 2024, through September 2025, the state saw 544 people die from the virus. The national number of pediatric flu deaths (280) was also the highest recorded amount since 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Last week, a new law went into effect&lt;a href="https://www.wral.com/news/local/flu-pharmacy-no-prescription-nc-october-2025/"&gt; that allows pharmacists to test and treat the flu without the obligation of needing a prescription&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

She illuminates the evolutionary mechanisms underlying cooperation between species as well as the role of plant-microbe mutualisms in ecosystem health. Kiers’s research shows that microbes are not passive accessories to plants but powerful actors in their own right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early work, Kiers demonstrated how legumes punish cheater or noncooperative bacteria. Leguminous plants rely on rhizobia bacteria in root nodules to fix or convert nitrogen gas into a form the plant can access. In experiments, Kiers used a nitrogen-free environment to force rhizobia bacteria to cheat, showing that legumes withhold oxygen from noncooperative nodules and suffocate those bacteria that failed to provide resources to their hosts. In addition, the severity of the punishment correlates to the underperformance of the bacteria. Through this system of “sanctions,” legumes ensure rhizobial cooperation. Kiers’s subsequent work focused on tracking resource trade between plants and the mycorrhizal fungal partners that colonize their root systems. About 80 percent of plants get essential nutrients from fungi; in return, plants supply fungi with carbon compounds necessary for fungal growth and survival. Kiers and a biophysics collaborator utilized tools like stable isotope probing; high-resolution, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08614-x"&gt;robotic imaging&lt;/a&gt;; and fluorescent quantum dots to follow the movement and transfer of nutrients across complex networks of roots and fungal hyphae (the branching structure of fungus). They tracked and manipulated the exchange of resources between plants and fungi and found a two-way system of trade analogous to a market economy. Plants and fungi maintain stable and fair resource exchange by sharing or withholding resources according to the trading partner’s performance. Kiers also demonstrated plants and fungi reward or punish trading partners with precision. Plants can allocate carbon to a specific fungus species even when multiple different species are closely intermingled within a single root. Likewise, fungi move nutrients in both directions along their hyphae to strategically manipulate carbon payoffs from plant partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2021, Kiers co-founded the &lt;a href="https://www.spun.earth/"&gt;Society for the Protection of Underground Networks&lt;/a&gt; (SPUN) to map and protect the Earth’s underground fungi. SPUN informs the public and policymakers about the importance of fungi to planetary health and advocates for conservation of fungal networks. Through SPUN, Kiers collaborates with local researchers around the world to map underground fungal communities and explore how human activity and climate change are impacting fungal biodiversity, the ability of fungi to draw carbon into soil, and agricultural productivity. Kiers is solving a longstanding evolutionary puzzle about how and why organisms cooperate in nature and protecting plant-fungal symbioses—one of the most important and widespread mutualisms on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;            &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MacArthur Foundation</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 19:18:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiaEFVX3lxTE4wM3BUN09jS056ZVZvUThzak94UFJKa296WVR4d3lKRXlKN3pOY1hmMzQ3NENEQTlqM0Fnd3lrWFFUdnJyd3M2ZHE5Z0F6Y2pueHFwQU92c1NVN0U5Um0tZ3F5aXNnQUpx</guid></item><item><title>美国鲜为人知的乳腺癌激增，报告警告-新闻周刊</title><link>https://www.newsweek.com/lesser-known-breast-cancer-surging-in-us-report-warns-10847301</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="PostContent_articleBody__FR8Mb"&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;A lesser-known type of breast cancer is on the rise among women in the U.S.—highlighting the need for us to pay closer attention to it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;An estimated 33,600 women will be diagnosed with lobular breast cancer or invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) this year, according to new projections by the American Cancer Society (ACS). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;The report finds that incidence rates of ILC—which starts in the milk-producing glands of the breast—have increased more steeply (2.8 percent per year) than all other breast cancers combined (0.8 percent) from 2012 to 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;“Although lobular breast cancer accounts for a little over 10 percent of all breast cancers, the sheer number of new diagnoses each year makes this disease important to understand,” said report author Angela Giaquinto, associate scientist at ACS, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;“Also, survival rates beyond seven years are significantly lower for ILC than the most common type of breast cancer [invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)], highlighting the pressing need for prevention and early detection strategies targeting this subtype to be brought to the forefront.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;The authors emphasize this is needed to improve the chance of better patient outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;In research and clinical trials, ILC is typically combined with the more common IDC, which can conceal many of its own key unique appearance and growth characteristics, according to the study authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;“ILC has distinctive characteristics that can contribute to delayed detection, resistance to therapy, and poorer prognosis for advanced disease,” the study authors wrote in the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;“Differentiating ILC from ductal carcinoma in research and clinical trials could help identify risk factors, facilitate treatment efficacy and lead to better understanding of metastatic mechanisms, thus improving outcomes for the increasing number of affected women.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;Reflecting a trend seen in other breast cancers, the U.S. report also found the steepest rise in ILC incidence among women of Asian American and Pacific Islander descent, increasing 4.4 percent per year from 2012 to 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;Overall, White women have the highest incidence rate of ILC and Black women have the second highest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;While survival for women with ILC is slightly higher than it is for ductal breast cancer in the first seven years after diagnosis and for localized-stage disease, it is lower for both regional and distant-stage disease at 10 years after diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;“Invasive lobular breast cancer is very understudied, probably because of a very good short-term prognosis. But at 10 years, these women with metastatic disease are half as likely to be alive as their counterparts with ductal cancer, probably because of the unique spread and resistance to therapy,” said author Rebecca Siegel, senior scientific director at ACS, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;“Our study underscores the need for much more information on lobular cancers across the board, from genetic studies to clinical trial data, so we can improve outcomes for the increasing number of women affected with this cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to the researchers for additional comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_blockParagraph__I2kr4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a tip on a health story that &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt; should be covering?

Overexpression of the gene has strong links to disorders that afflict the body's connective tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has also been implicated in neurodevelopment. Certain types of collagen, particularly in the developing brain, form a structural scaffold. By processing collagen, ADAMTS2 helps build and organize this essential framework, and disruption of this process could &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15159541/key-brain-degrades-alzheimers-breakthrough-therapies.html"&gt;lead to faulty brain circuits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The latest research added that ADAMTS2 was the most significantly overexpressed gene in the brains of African American individuals with confirmed &lt;a target="_self" href="/sciencetech/alzheimers-disease/index.html" id="mol-4da623e0-a453-11f0-a804-7da67ad40ff1"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease compared to those without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the brain, one of its key targets is Reelin. Reelin is a crucial protein for proper brain development, helping to maintain cognitive function&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically, Reelin helps protect against the hallmarks of Alzheimer's by reducing the formation of the tau tangles and limiting amyloid plaque formation, both of which are believed to be &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14757525/First-subtle-sign-dementia-strike-20-years-disease-sets-experts-discover-condition-stealth-phase.html"&gt;hallmarks of the disease&lt;/a&gt;. However, ADAMTS2 can impair Reelin's protective function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overactive ADAMTS2 disrupts this protective pathway, leading to increased Tau and amyloid buildup, which drives cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Boston University scientists have identified the ADAMTS2 gene as a major factor in Alzheimer's disease, based on a large study of brains from African American donors (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These findings could open doors to new, targeted genetic treatments designed to inhibit or block the ADAMTS2 protein. Because the effect is the same across people of different ancestries, a drug targeting ADAMTS2 could potentially help a broad range of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lowering ADAMTS2 activity could also be a strategy to prevent symptoms from developing, even in people who have early signs of the disease in their brains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study is also impactful in its design. Historically, most genetic research has been done on people of White/European ancestry. By focusing on an understudied group, Black Americans, the latest research ensures that future Alzheimer's treatments and diagnostic tools will work for them too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is a looming plague in America as the US population skews older by the year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The population aged 65 and above grew from approximately 13 percent in 2010 to more than 17 percent in 2022, with forecasts suggesting it could reach nearly 21 percent of the total population by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Age is the most critical risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. Risk of developing the disease doubles approximately every five years after the age of 65, fueling projections that the case burden will rise from the current 7 million cases to nearly 14 million by 2060.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study’s sample included donated brain tissue from 212 African Americans, including 82 cognitively healthy people and 125 with confirmed Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers compared that cohort with another study that included people of European descent to gain a better understanding of the gene’s actions in different demographics. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although this study only included Black participants, its most significant result aligns with the result from the separate study on White participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Lindsay Farrer, chief of biomedical genetics at the school and corresponding author, said: ‘To our knowledge, this is the first time in similarly designed AD genetics studies that the most significant finding was the same in both white and African Americans.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tissue was sourced from the prefrontal cortex, a region particularly affected by Alzheimer’s&lt;span&gt;, and scientists were able to visualize each gene and its level of activity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also identified genes with expression levels that were significantly different between the Alzheimer’s cases and the controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The primary result was the identification of ADAMTS2, which showed the strongest overexpression in Alzheimer’s cases, with its expression levels 1.52 times higher than in controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The same gene was also a top-ranked hit in a separate study’s computer analysis conducted on a predominantly White/European ancestry cohort, confirming its importance across ancestries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers identified 65 genes that behaved consistently across both African American and European Ancestry study groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This shared set included genes that were either significantly overexpressed or underexpressed in Alzheimer's patients compared to healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The critical finding was that the direction of change was identical in both populations; genes turned up in one group were also turned up in the other, and genes turned down were turned down in both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The consistency across study populations indicated that these 65 genes are part of a core mechanism of Alzheimer's disease, common across ancestral backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their findings were published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70629"&gt;Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/a&gt;, the journal of the Alzheimer's Association. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers concluded: ‘The inclusion of [African American] participants in AD research is important not only to ensure that predictions made based on genetic and [genomic] data are accurate in this population, but also because of the potential it will lead to new and important advances in knowledge about AD risk that will benefit everyone.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Williams is a mathematician elucidating unexpected connections between algebraic combinatorics and concepts in other areas of math and physics. Williams has made significant contributions to numerous mathematical fields, including cluster algebras, representation theory, and algebraic geometry. She has also forged cross-disciplinary collaborations to tackle long-standing and challenging problems in physics related to quantum field theory, particle physics, and wave propagation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadly, algebraic combinatorics develops mathematical descriptions of the properties and relationships among a finite set of elements that can be combinatorially connected within a system. Much of Williams’s research centers on using combinatorial approaches to understand the nature of the positive Grassmannian. A Grassmannian is a geometric space that encompasses all of the multidimensional planes of a fixed dimension. The positive Grassmannian is the portion with only positive coordinates. In early work, Williams explored how points (formed by the multidimensional planes) in the positive Grassmannian divide it into cells—basically, the puzzle pieces that make it up. She determined several characteristics of the cells, including a formula for the number of different cells in a positive Grassmannian of any dimension. Williams has also uncovered new applications for the Grassmannian. She and a collaborator found correspondences between patterns of soliton wave interactions and points on the positive Grassmannian. Soliton waves are solitary waves that maintain their shape and speed as they move through space, like waves on a pond. Williams and her collaborator showed that the positive Grassmannian can describe how the peaks of soliton waves behave as they cross each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, Williams has worked with mathematicians and particle physicists on applying the combinatorial properties of positive Grassmannians to calculate scattering amplitudes (the probabilities of different outcomes from collisions of fundamental particles). Williams has developed mathematical proofs for the amplituhedron, a geometric shape that embodies a possible outcome of a collision. She showed that the positive Grassmannian can be used to triangulate the amplituhedron and, therefore, understand its volume, which gives the amplitude. With a curiosity-driven approach to research and willingness to collaborate across disciplines, Williams is expanding fundamental mathematical theory and building fruitful connections between mathematics and other scientific fields.&lt;/p&gt;            &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MacArthur Foundation</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 17:51:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTFBvLV91V1ZYQVlxRnB2U29aZUVockJkYncyb0hpVG40c2xCeUxIUEFyQ05sNWpsVl90a0VzSzVrTUJ0VXBOQUhlUXBsLWJEUmJ4QVEwUHBYdVJnSTc5dG11X24xV1RXWi1kdmNEUGxqczAtUQ</guid></item><item><title>大脑健康：改善大脑功能的10个简单步骤-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/brain-health-10-simple-steps-you-should-take-to-improve-brain-function/photostory/124394470.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The human brain is an astonishing machine- complex, adaptive, and constantly reshaping itself in response to how we live.

    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Prominent figures who have had bladder cancer include singer Frank Sinatra, actor James Lipton, and British artist Tracey Emin (pictured) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr González-Pérez, also said: 'This study is only the tip of the iceberg. We analysed 16 genes in the bladders of 45 people, yet we already found important differences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The same approach can be applied to other tissues and risk factors.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But researchers also saw a striking effect among samples of donors who had previously smoked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among donors over the age of 55, those with a history of smoking carried a high frequency of mutations in the TERT promoter, a DNA element that allows cells to avoid aging and continue dividing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bladder cancer is &lt;span&gt;the 11th most common cancer in the UK, and the 7th most common cancer in men.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prominent figures who have had bladder cancer include singer Frank Sinatra, actor James Lipton, and British artist Tracey Emin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Roughly with 80 per cent of cases diagnosed every year are in over 65s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As well as blood in urine, bladder cancer symptoms include more frequent and painful urination, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, incontinence and abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Rumsey said that pumpkin seeds provide protein, magnesium, and vitamin E, which have been linked to anti-inflammatory benefits.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re considering adding pumpkin or chia seeds to your diet, consider what areas of your health you hope to boost.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Chia seeds excel in promoting glycemic control and cardiovascular, bone, and digestive health due to their high fiber and omega-3 content,” Johnson said. “Pumpkin seeds are especially valuable for protein, mineral support, prostate health, sleep quality, and immune function.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s no reason you can’t add both to your diet. Just remember that eating chia seeds dry can be a choking hazard and cause gastrointestinal discomfort.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Therefore, if you aren’t mixing them into a dish with wet ingredients—such as yogurt or salad dressing—you should soak them before eating.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damage to the brainstem - the brain's 'control center' - is behind long-lasting physical and psychiatric effects of severe Covid-19 infection, a study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using ultra-high-resolution scanners that can see the living brain in fine detail, researchers from the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford were able to observe the damaging effects Covid-19 can have on the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study team scanned the brains of 30 people who had been admitted to hospital with severe Covid-19 early in the pandemic, before vaccines were available. The researchers found that Covid-19 infection damages the region of the brainstem associated with breathlessness, fatigue and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The powerful MRI scanners used for the study, known as 7-Tesla or 7T scanners, can measure &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/What-Does-Inflammation-Do-to-the-Body.aspx" class="linked-term"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; in the brain. Their results, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Brain&lt;/em&gt;, will help scientists and clinicians understand the long-term effects of Covid-19 on the brain and the rest of the body. Although the study was started before the long-term effects of Covid were recognised, it will help to better understand this condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brainstem, which connects the brain to the spinal cord, is the control center for many basic life functions and reflexes. Clusters of nerve cells in the brainstem, known as nuclei, regulate and process essential bodily functions such as breathing, heart rate, pain and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things happening in and around the brainstem are vital for quality of life, but it had been impossible to scan the inflammation of the brainstem nuclei in living people, because of their tiny size and difficult position. Usually, scientists only get a good look at the brainstem during post-mortem examinations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Catarina Rua, first author from the Department of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Cambridge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The brainstem is the critical junction box between our conscious selves and what is happening in our bodies," said Professor James Rowe, also from the Department of Clinical Neurosciences, who co-led the research. "The ability to see and understand how the brainstem changes in response to Covid-19 will help explain and treat the long-term effects more effectively."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, before effective vaccines were available, post-mortem studies of patients who had died from severe Covid-19 infections showed changes in their brainstems, including inflammation. Many of these changes were thought to result from a post-infection immune response, rather than direct virus invasion of the brain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mobile-middle-mrec-promo-spot" class="mobile-promo-wrap mobile-promo-mrec"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;"People who were very sick early in the pandemic showed long-lasting brain changes, likely caused by an immune response to the virus. But measuring that immune response is difficult in living people," said Rowe. "Normal hospital-type MRI scanners can't see inside the brain with the kind of chemical and physical detail we need."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="trendmd-conditional-suggestions" class="related-content-embed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But with 7T scanners, we can now measure these details. The active immune cells interfere with the ultra-high magnetic field, so that we're able to detect how they are behaving," said Rua. "Cambridge was special because we were able to scan even the sickest and infectious patients, early in the pandemic."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the patients admitted to hospital early in the pandemic reported fatigue, breathlessness and chest pain as troubling long-lasting symptoms. The researchers hypothesised these symptoms were in part the result of damage to key brainstem nuclei, damage which persists long after Covid-19 infection has passed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers saw that multiple regions of the brainstem, in particular the medulla oblongata, pons and midbrain, showed abnormalities consistent with a neuroinflammatory response. The abnormalities appeared several weeks after hospital admission, and in regions of the brain responsible for controlling breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The fact that we see abnormalities in the parts of the brain associated with breathing strongly suggests that long-lasting symptoms are an effect of inflammation in the brainstem following Covid-19 infection," said Rua. "These effects are over and above the effects of age and gender, and are more pronounced in those who had had severe Covid-19."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the physical effects of Covid-19, the 7T scanners provided evidence of some of the psychiatric effects of the disease. The brainstem monitors breathlessness, as well as fatigue and anxiety. "Mental health is intimately connected to brain health, and patients with the most marked immune response also showed higher levels of depression and anxiety," said Rowe. "Changes in the brainstem caused by Covid-19 infection could also lead to poor mental health outcomes, because of the tight connection between physical and mental health."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers say the results could aid in the understanding of other conditions associated with inflammation of the brainstem, like MS and dementia. The 7T scanners could also be used to monitor the effectiveness of different treatments for brain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This was an incredible collaboration, right at the peak of the pandemic, when testing was very difficult, and I was amazed how well the 7T scanners worked," said Rua. "I was really impressed with how, in the heat of the moment, the collaboration between lots of different researchers came together so effectively."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was supported in part by the NIHR Cambridge Biomedical Research Centre, the NIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre, and the University of Oxford COVID Medical Sciences Division Rapid Response Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mobile-bottom-promo-spot" class="mobile-promo-wrap mobile-promo-leaderboard-320"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is a potent psychoactive molecule present in the brain and much of the world’s plant life, but it also may be able to save humans from damage in the event of a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists in Hungary used it to reduce the harmful effects of stroke in animal models and cell culture experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known to produce life-changing experiences reported to include the perception of dimensional travel, eco-death, encounters with intelligent beings, and the feeling of achieving a universal love with all living things, DMT can be found everywhere in nature, and is in fact produced endogenously in the human pineal gland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hungarian team, led by Professor Mária Deli, Professor Zoltán Nagy, and Dr. Sándor Nardai, found that DMT treatment restored the structure and function of the damaged blood-brain barrier in mice that had suffered a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also improved the function of astrocytes, inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines in brain endothelial cells and peripheral immune cells, and significantly reduced infarct volume and edema formation. The team &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adx5958"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; these results in the journal Science Advances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The therapeutic options currently available for stroke are very limited. The dual action of DMT, protecting the blood-brain barrier while reducing brain inflammation, offers a novel, complex approach that could complement existing treatments,” &lt;a href="https://www.brc.hu/en/blog/2025/9/19/a-natural-compound-against-stroke-psychoactive-agent-protects-brain-vessels-and-reduces-inflammation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Judit Vigh, co-first author of the work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PSYCHEDELIC RESEARCH: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since current stroke therapies do not always result in full recovery, a DMT-based treatment may represent a promising new alternative, mainly in combination with existing methods. The recent findings from researchers in Szeged and Budapest support the development of a therapy that goes beyond the limitations of conventional stroke treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials have already begun abroad, and investigation on the long-term effects of DMT are currently ongoing, but there is still a long way to go before it reaches everyday medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While most European countries including Hungary consider DMT a hallucinogen and therefore controlled via strict criminal laws, both the Netherlands and Portugal have taken a more open position on DMT and arguably the more well-known ayahuasca, in which DMT is an active ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 800,000 strokes occur annually in the US. 1 in 6 deaths (17.5%) from cardiovascular disease in the most recent data-collected year, were due to stroke. Costs from strokes rose to $56 billion during that year.&lt;/p&gt;

Using ultra-accurate DNA sequencing, scientists found that sperm from older men were significantly more likely to carry disease-causing mutations, including those linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This phenomenon, known as “selfish selection,” allows certain mutations to thrive within the testes, increasing risks to offspring over time. The findings offer crucial insights into how paternal age influences genetic inheritance and the mechanisms driving mutation spread across generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age-Linked Mutation Rise:&lt;/strong&gt; Harmful mutations increase from ~2% in younger men’s sperm to 3–5% in older men.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selfish Selection:&lt;/strong&gt; Some mutations gain a biological advantage during sperm production, helping them spread.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic Health Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Many affected genes are tied to disorders in children and inherited cancer risks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Wellcome Sanger Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harmful genetic changes in sperm become substantially more common as men age because some are actively favoured during sperm production, new research has revealed. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a landmark study published today (8 October) in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, researchers from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, in collaboration with the TwinsUK study at King’s College London, have comprehensively mapped how harmful DNA changes in sperm cells can increase across the genome as men age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-113274"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene.jpg" alt="This shows a sperm cell and DNA." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/10/older-father-genetic-mutation-neurosiene-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt; The work highlights how natural selection within sperm can be directly observed in the DNA of children, influencing their chances of inheriting certain genetic disorders. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings create new possibilities to explore how lifestyle and environmental factors might influence genetic risks passed on to future generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In renewing tissues, mutations – changes in DNA – can give cells a competitive advantage leading to ‘clones’ of cells that carry the same mutations. Groups of these clones then expand to outgrow other cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike mutations in ordinary, or somatic cells, which make up connective tissue, bones and organs, mutations in sperm and egg cells are transmitted to the next generation of offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, until recently, it has been difficult to measure how strongly these mutations are favoured in sperm because DNA sequencing methods were not accurate enough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, researchers used NanoSeq, an ultra-accurate DNA sequencing method to analyse sperm from 81 healthy men, aged between 24 and 75 years, with unprecedented precision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sperm samples were collected as part of the TwinsUK cohort, the UK’s largest adult twin registry, providing a unique opportunity to study genetic variation across a diverse and well-characterised population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results show that around 2 per cent of sperm from men in their early 30s carried disease-causing mutations, but this rises to 3–5 per cent of sperm from middle-aged (43 to 58 years) and older men (59 to 74 years).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst men may be more likely to father children at a younger age, the researchers found that in those aged 70, 4.5 per cent of sperm carry disease-causing mutations. This clear age-related rise highlights how genetic risks for offspring increase as fathers get older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This risk is driven not just by the steady build-up of random changes in DNA, but by a subtle form of natural selection acting on the sperm-producing cells in the testes, giving some mutations a competitive edge during sperm production. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers identified 40 genes where certain changes in DNA are favoured during sperm production, including many linked to severe neurodevelopmental disorders in children and inherited cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While 13 genes have already been associated with this process, the new findings show it is far more widespread than previously understood, affecting a broad range of genes important for cell growth and development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the proportion of sperm carrying harmful mutations increases with age, not all of these changes lead to successful fertilisation or live births. Some may impair fertilisation, embryo development, or result in pregnancy loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research is needed to understand exactly how the growing burden of sperm mutations translates into health outcomes for children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers hope that uncovering how variations in DNA arise and are shaped by selection in sperm will help improve reproductive risk assessment and open new opportunities to study how environmental and lifestyle factors impact genetic risks in future generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a complementary study, also published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; today, scientists from Harvard Medical School and the Sanger Institute investigated the same phenomenon from a different angle by looking at mutations already passed on to children, rather than those measured directly in sperm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By analysing DNA from over 54,000 parent–child trios and 800,000 healthy individuals, the team identified more than 30 genes where mutations give sperm cells a competitive edge, again including many linked to rare developmental disorders and cancer, and many overlapping the set of genes observed directly in sperm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that these mutations can increase sperm mutation rates roughly 500-fold which helps explain why some rare genetic disorders appear when parents do not carry the mutations in their own DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study notes that as these mutations are common in the sperm, it may look like some genes cause false-positive disease association due to the elevated mutation rate rather than a true disease link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work highlights how natural selection within sperm can be directly observed in the DNA of children, influencing their chances of inheriting certain genetic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Matthew Neville, first author from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: “We expected to find some evidence of selection shaping mutations in sperm. What surprised us was just how much it drives up the number of sperm carrying mutations linked to serious diseases.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Matt Hurles, Director of the Wellcome Sanger Institute and co-author, said: “Our findings reveal a hidden genetic risk that increases with paternal age. Some changes in DNA not only survive but thrive within the testes, meaning that fathers who conceive later in life may unknowingly have a higher risk of passing on a harmful mutation to their children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Kerrin Small, co-author and Scientific Director of the TwinsUK study at King’s College London, said: “We are incredibly grateful to the twins who took part in this study. By working with the TwinsUK cohort, we could include valuable longitudinal samples linked to rich health and genetic information, allowing us to explore how mutations accumulate and evolve with age in healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This collaboration highlights the power of large, population-based cohorts for advancing our understanding of human development and inheritance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Raheleh Rahbari, senior author and Group Leader at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: “There’s a common assumption that because the germline has a low mutation rate, it is well protected. But in reality, the male germline is a dynamic environment where natural selection can favour harmful mutations, sometimes with consequences for the next generation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is part-funded by Wellcome.

In humans, positive selection of driver mutations during spermatogenesis can increase the birth prevalence of certain developmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until recently, characterizing the extent of this selection in sperm has been limited by the error rates of sequencing technologies. Here we used the duplex sequencing method NanoSeq to sequence 81 bulk sperm samples from individuals aged 24–75 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings revealed a linear accumulation of 1.67 (95% confidence interval of 1.41–1.92) mutations per year per haploid genome driven by two mutational signatures associated with human ageing. Deep targeted and exome NanoSeq of sperm samples identified more than 35,000 germline coding mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We detected 40 genes (31 newly identified) under significant positive selection in the male germline that have activating or loss-of-function mechanisms and are involved in diverse cellular pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the positively selected genes are associated with developmental or cancer predisposition disorders in children, whereas four of the genes exhibited increased frequencies of protein-truncating variants in healthy populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We show that positive selection during spermatogenesis drives a 2–3-fold increased risk of known disease-causing mutations, which results in 3–5% of sperm from middle-aged to older individuals with a pathogenic mutation across the exome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings shed light on germline selection dynamics and highlight a broader increased disease risk for children born to fathers of advanced age than previously appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 16:57:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxQbEpxdzJXbFFyNE40RG1uSEl4enpTM3h2ME1GTlVqNE92VnNZeUhuQkNFRVNtMXR4a2t3dlJXUVkzbENGdGptRHN0RlFIMVZDS2xwQzF6RmxENm5ySUJ5QjhDelNodURhQkpYZU5qcUNNZ0hlUDdMVFRoWlBmNFU1SkdB</guid></item><item><title>“谷歌DNA”为生物学大数据带来秩序-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03219-w</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03219-w/d41586-025-03219-w_51546810.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03219-w/d41586-025-03219-w_51546810.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Close up view of a researcher's hand interacting with a DNA sequence on a digital display." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03219-w/d41586-025-03219-w_51546810.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;MetaGraph indexes and vast archives of DNA, RNA, and protein sequences.

In the same way that YouTube searches can retrieve every video that features, say, red balloons even when those key words don’t appear in the title, tags or description, MetaGraph can uncover genetic patterns hidden deep within expansive sequencing data sets without needing those patterns to be explicitly annotated in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It enables things that cannot be done in any other way,” Chikhi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02826-1" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03219-w/d41586-025-03219-w_24038964.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Smart software untangles gene regulation in cells&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Indexing life’s library&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The motivation behind MetaGraph was to address an accessibility problem in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d42859-020-00002-x/index.html" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d42859-020-00002-x/index.html" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;sequencing data sets&lt;/a&gt;. The size of these repositories has risen at a blistering pace in the past few decades, but this growth has presented challenges for the scientists using the data they contain. Raw sequencing reads are fragmented, noisy and too numerous to search directly. “The volume of the data, paradoxically, is the main inhibitor of us actually using the data,” says Babaian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study author, André Kahles, a bioinformatician at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich in Switzerland, MetaGraph could help researchers to ask biological questions of repositories such as the Sequence Read Archive (&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;SRA&lt;/a&gt;), a public database containing in excess of 100 million billion DNA letters&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They tackled the problem through the use of mathematical ‘graphs’ that links overlapping DNA fragments together, much like sentences that share the same words lining up in a book index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers integrated data from seven publicly funded data repositories, creating 18.8 million unique DNA and RNA sequence sets and 210 billion amino-acid sequence sets across all clades of life — including viruses, bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, including humans. They also developed a search engine for these sequences, in which users use text prompts to search these integrated archives of raw data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is a totally new way to interact with this body of data,” says Kahles. “It’s compressed, but accessible on the fly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03423-0" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;The huge protein database that spawned AlphaFold and biology’s AI revolution&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate the utility of MetaGraph, the study authors used it to scan 241,384 human gut microbiome samples for genetic indicators of &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03218-x" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03218-x" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;antibiotic resistance around the world&lt;/a&gt;, building on work that used an earlier version of the tool to track drug-resistance genes in bacterial strains that live in subway systems across major urban centres&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR3" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.

McLellan’s engineered viral proteins are critical to catalyzing vaccine design, particularly for infectious respiratory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viruses infect their hosts by using proteins on their surface that fuse to and invade a host’s cells. These fusion proteins are desirable targets for vaccines since disabling them could prevent infection. However, the structure of fusion proteins is highly variable over time, making them difficult to isolate and target. In early work, McLellan used X-ray crystallography to describe, for the first time, the atomic-level structures (or conformations) of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) fusion protein. RSV can cause severe infections in infants and older adults, but a vaccine has been elusive for more than 50 years. McLellan determined that one of the specific pre-fusion conformations he mapped is strongly antigenic—that is, elicits a strong antibody response in the human immune system. In addition, he discovered that incorporating amino acid changes into specific sites of the protein’s structure locks it into this antigenic configuration and prevents structural variability. McLellan’s engineered protein became the basis for the first successful RSV vaccine. He continued to advance these structure-based approaches to vaccine design in research on coronaviruses that cause the common cold and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). McLellan demonstrated that two proline residues, a type of amino acid, can stabilize the structure of pre-fusion coronavirus spike proteins. This work enabled McLellan to act quickly when the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, emerged in early 2020. His lab engineered a stabilized, antigenic version of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein just weeks after release of the virus’s genetic sequence. Their stabilized protein sequence is used in all COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in the United States. The vaccines trigger our immune system to generate antibodies against the stabilized spike protein, training it to recognize and inactivate the virus in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, McLellan’s team is focused on developing a universal vaccine that would be effective against all coronaviruses. They have identified the stem of the viral spike protein as a possible antigen and characterized several antibodies that react across the family of coronaviruses. He is also investigating the surface proteins of emerging viruses and the potential to apply structure-based vaccine design to bacterial pathogens. McLellan’s insights into protein structure, function, and engineering are critical to protecting human health from the continual emergence of new infectious diseases.&lt;/p&gt;            &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MacArthur Foundation</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 16:36:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFAtTmdiZTY2RGtMVUlweEhQYkdhX3RDVWtoTWVSSFNKeTdUOUVwUFptZ3lBWTlHVDI5QkEwOFBXeGttSHY5OXM2Q1EwSTdtZDZ6NGRBMVFTQjg1ck9HQmo4MUhOT0RSaTdJNV9KOURR</guid></item><item><title>您晚上会磨牙吗？以下是该怎么做-《卫报》</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/oct/08/teeth-grinding-night-bruxism-what-to-do</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;ow do you sleep at night? I don’t mean morally – I mean physically. Does your body soften and relax into a gentle slumber? Or do you, like roughly 8% of the adult population, spend your nightly repose gritting your teeth like an NFL coach whose team is behind in overtime?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Even if you do, you might not know. Teeth grinding, also known as bruxism, occurs both during the day (awake bruxism) and at night (sleep bruxism). &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/sleep" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Sleep&lt;/a&gt; bruxism is generally harder to detect because, well, we’re asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“People are usually unaware of the condition,” says Dr Subha Giri, a dental sleep medicine expert at the Mayo Clinic. Instead, she says, night-time teeth grinders may be alerted “by caregivers or bed partners who hear grating, tapping or clicking sounds”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Below, what you need to know about sleep bruxism and how to manage it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-sleep-bruxism" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is sleep bruxism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sleep bruxism is an “involuntary jaw-muscle activity such as grinding, clenching or jaw thrusting” that occurs while we sleep, says Dr Hosam Alraqiq, program director of the Dental Public Health Research Fellowship at the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research. If this happens regularly, it can damage teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The condition is more common during childhood and adolescence, when prevalence ranges from 14% to 18%, as opposed to 8% among adults, explains Giri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Experts aren’t sure what exactly causes sleep bruxism, but it tends to be more common in people with a family history of the condition, which suggests there is a genetic link, says Dr Michelle Drerup, director of the Behavioral Sleep Medicine Program at the Cleveland Clinic. It is also more likely to appear in individuals with medical conditions like sleep apnea, Parkinson’s disease, dementia or gastroesophageal reflux disease (Gerd), she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Other risk factors include “stress, anxiety, alcohol use, smoking, excessive caffeine, and certain medications” like SSRIs and antipsychotics, Drerup says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-can-you-tell-if-you-have-sleep-bruxism" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can you tell if you have sleep bruxism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Maybe you’ve been told that you click-clack like a typewriter when you sleep. But there are other ways to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Dentists may detect patterns of tooth wear that indicate bruxism,” Giri says. For instance, the tooth surfaces that normally make contact during chewing might show “flattening or damage”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Symptoms like waking up with your teeth clenched, chronic jaw pain or dental sensitivity may also suggest that you’re grinding at night, says Alraqiq – but “the gold standard” for diagnosis is the sleep study, a diagnostic test in which healthcare providers monitor brain and body activity while the subject sleeps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-impact-does-sleep-bruxism-have-on-your-health" class="dcr-n4qeq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What impact does sleep bruxism have on your health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sleep bruxism is not always harmful, Alraqiq says. It can also be temporary. But in more serious and long-lasting cases, it can have a big impact on dental health – literally. People can clench their teeth with a “&lt;a href="https://www.msdmanuals.com/home/mouth-and-dental-disorders/symptoms-of-oral-and-dental-disorders/teeth-grinding" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;force of up to 250 pounds&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-15" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But in more serious cases, where symptoms are causing problems and discomfort, “evaluation by a dentist or physician is essential”, she says. Dentists can make a custom nightguard. While this won’t stop the grinding, it will protect the teeth from damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sleep hygiene and behavioral adjustments are key to managing sleep bruxism, says Alraqiq. “Keeping a regular schedule, limiting caffeine, and creating a calm sleep environment can reduce triggers,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In addition, Giri suggests relaxation techniques and cognitive behavioral therapy to manage the stress and anxiety which may lead to teeth grinding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In severe cases, healthcare providers may recommend botulinum toxin (Botox) injections, says Drerup. These can help “relax jaw muscles temporarily and reduce pain”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Giving your sleeping partner some nice earplugs probably wouldn’t hurt either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 16:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxNR1lWUkt3dTFtTUxici13RFZ3LW9tRmJuUzE0XzJaX01YdWdab0dQeEVlQWdkSS1NTWJpbkpPNmxRSXRIcWtXRGFSR2ZKVnBkZ1J3bUh3SHYzb1c2M0FFTmE1SU16LW1SM1UwTy03a2Y0b0c4VV9XZFZhT2szSF9vSHh5OXNRb0xGbWR0NXZPSVlZUQ</guid></item><item><title>“Bluetoothing” ：血液共享药物趋势助长了全球H.I.V.激增-纽约时报</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/world/asia/bluetoothing-drug-blood-sharing.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 16:01:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxQaVRLOEZsMm1vbHFEa0RPbHlHaEpTaDM3WHNnVWpxSklZMW5sT09kVXRlcVhCQ1BlQjNzcW9GN21xSU1OQXc2MDU4Ni12QVpyX0JyUE1CTmplbm9FbVFLMG9SU3NjX01NUlpfUFZEVXY0STktS05NZ3RsUXEtX3oxd1lTcGxjOUcxM0E</guid></item><item><title>小RFK的新饮食指南可能会引起争议。以下是需要注意的事项-美国国家公共广播电台（ NPR ）</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/10/08/nx-s1-5564026/dietary-guidelines-rfk-saturated-fat-2025</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;New dietary guidelines are due out this fall, and based on public comments by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., they could amount to a radical departure from what Americans have seen in years past.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture — the two agencies that issue the guidelines — update them every five years to reflect the latest research findings.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Typically, they follow many of the recommendations of a scientific advisory committee that spends about two years reviewing the evidence and compiling a dense scientific report.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The advice in the&lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/2025-advisory-committee-report" target="_blank"&gt; 2025 scientific report&lt;/a&gt; hasn't changed much from previous years. It emphasizes consuming fruits and vegetables, lean meat, legumes and whole grains, and avoiding too much saturated fat, added sugar and refined carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Kennedy has strong views about food and has made no secret of his disdain for the existing guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In public appearances, he has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/31/nx-s1-5519288/the-federal-government-will-issue-new-dietary-guidelines-heres-what-to-expect" target="_blank"&gt;disparaged&lt;/a&gt; the process for developing them and seems to conflate the 2025 scientific report with the actual guidelines, calling the document "incomprehensible" and "Biden guidelines." (In reality, the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;most recent guidelines&lt;/a&gt; were issued in 2020, during President Trump's first term.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.c-span.org/program/news-conference/secretaries-rollins-and-kennedy-and-othersnews-conference-on-snap-waivers/663810" target="_blank"&gt;pledged&lt;/a&gt; the upcoming ones will be a mere four to six pages, with a focus on "whole foods, healthy foods and local foods."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If he follows through on this promise, it will cause "substantial chaos," says &lt;a href="https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/news/berkeley-scientist-looks-back-american-nutritional-guidelines" target="_blank"&gt;Kevin Klatt&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrition research scientist at the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many people still think of the dietary guidelines as synonymous with the food pyramid, which was phased out more than a decade ago in favor of a new graphic called "&lt;a href="https://www.myplate.gov" target="_blank"&gt;MyPlate&lt;/a&gt;." In reality, they function primarily as a policy document. &lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The guidelines contain specific terminology and targets for calories and nutrients that guide federal food aid for mothers and infants, free school lunches and what's served at military bases and in federal prisons.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Replacing that with a four-page, consumer-oriented document telling people to eat 'whole foods' and 'unprocessed foods,' none of which has a real definition?" says Klatt. "There's no way that that can hold any policy weight."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Emily Hilliard, press secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, did not offer any details to NPR about who is writing the guidelines or what will be in them, but instead referred to the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/The-MAHA-Strategy-WH.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) strategy report&lt;/a&gt; and said the guidelines "will align with science, data, and health recommendations in a concise, user-friendly format."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;There's no disagreement with the idea that the quality of the American diet is very poor, in particular because of its reliance on refined starches and added sugars, says &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/frank-b-hu/" target="_blank"&gt;Frank Hu&lt;/a&gt;, who chairs the department of nutrition and epidemiology at Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The question is how to deal with it?" he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As it stands, most of the public doesn't follow the guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MAHA-Report-The-White-House.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;attributed this&lt;/a&gt;, in part, to the "technical language" they're written in. But Klatt says changing how Americans eat and reducing obesity and diet-related diseases requires much more than giving people a few pages of advice.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While influential for federal policy, the guidelines can't, on their own, radically reshape the broader food landscape, which is driven by social and economic factors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I think that's a fantasy," says Klatt. "We've been saying to eat less sugar since the 1980 dietary guidelines."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And yet Kennedy has promised big changes, some of which could trigger heated debate. So, cue the sound of sizzling beef tallow and check out what might be in store.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Saturated fat and meat could get another look&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-92527" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Overhauling standard advice on saturated fat would be controversial.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The guidelines have long advised limiting saturated fats, like those found in red meat, to less than 10% of daily calories because of &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011737.pub3/full" target="_blank"&gt;evidence showing&lt;/a&gt; that this kind of fat can &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/saturated-fats#:~:text=How%20do%20saturated%20fats%20affect%20my%20health?,temperature%2C%20they%20are%20sometimes%20called%20%E2%80%9Csolid%20fats.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank"&gt;increase cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, which can increase heart disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And the 2025 review of the evidence came down squarely behind the current guidelines, issued five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Kennedy has made no secret of his affinity for meat and the saturated fat that comes along with it, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/cf7bJYBIT8A?si=rEFeIJrq6Za7o2Sg&amp;amp;t=30" target="_blank"&gt;describing his own eating habits&lt;/a&gt; as "a carnivore diet."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He has &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@robertfkennedyjrofficial/video/7442451712197004574" target="_blank"&gt;touted&lt;/a&gt; Thanksgiving turkey fried in beef tallow, and in March he sat down for burger and fries at a Steak 'n Shake in Florida to highlight the chain's &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/14/nx-s1-5326555/rfk-beef-tallow-fries-seed-oils" target="_blank"&gt;switch&lt;/a&gt; from cooking with vegetable oil to beef tallow. At a July &lt;a href="https://www.c-span.org/program/public-affairs-event/national-governors-association-conversation-with-health-and-human-services-secretary/662657" target="_blank"&gt;meeting with governors&lt;/a&gt; in Colorado, he said the new guidelines would be "common sense" and "stress the need to eat saturated fats," including dairy, "good meat, fresh meat and vegetables."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Thought leaders in the MAHA movement argue that animal products have been vilified, and some advocate for low-carb, higher-fat diets like the ketogenic diet or the carnivore diet.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And in recent years, researchers have started &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/115/1/154/6369072?login=false" target="_blank"&gt;looking into&lt;/a&gt; low-carb, higher-fat diets, with some studies finding improvement in markers of cardiovascular health, though more research is still needed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/cir.0000000000000510" target="_blank"&gt;evidence for the link&lt;/a&gt; between saturated fat and cardiovascular disease began with studies in the 1950s, when Americans ate more red meat. Then in the diet craze of the 1980s, marketers pushed a lot of low-fat snack foods that were high in refined carbohydrates and sugar. But swapping fat for sugar and empty carbs &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/cir.0000000000000510" target="_blank"&gt;is also problematic&lt;/a&gt;, and it has been complicated to untangle the effects of ever-changing dietary patterns.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Instead of saturated fat, the current guidelines encourage eating foods that are high in unsaturated fat, including nuts, avocados and olive oil, which are linked to lower cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At this point, Harvard's &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/frank-b-hu/" target="_blank"&gt;Hu&lt;/a&gt; doesn't see a rationale to "make a major shift" in dietary recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Has the science really changed that much in the last 20 years in terms of saturated fat? Not really," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Whole-fat dairy vs. skim milk&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-92529" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Alongside his embrace of meat, Kennedy has also &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-rfk-jr-makes-major-announcement-with-fda-and-international-dairy-foods-association" target="_blank"&gt;championed&lt;/a&gt; full-fat dairy products, saying he plans to end the "attack on whole milk, cheese and yogurt" in the new guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That comes after decades of the American public being told to opt for fat-free or low-fat dairy, largely out of concern for the amount of saturated fat in these foods.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As with saturated fat, it has been difficult to parse the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5867544/" target="_blank"&gt;complex relationships&lt;/a&gt; among dairy fat, cholesterol and cardiovascular risk, leading some researchers to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/08/nx-s1-5528747/what-kind-of-dairy-does-a-body-good-science-is-updating-the-answer" target="_blank"&gt;rethink the issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ehe.osu.edu/human-sciences/directory?id=bruno.27" target="_blank"&gt;Richard Bruno&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of human nutrition at Ohio State University, says there's evidence suggesting that "consuming saturated fat from dairy foods doesn't seem to be behaving the way we think it should behave, based on the historical evidence that [it] is linked to heart disease."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bruno is among the researchers who argue that the data doesn't support the existing recommendation to favor low-fat dairy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because dairy is such a broad category, it's challenging to make sweeping statements, argues &lt;a href="https://iid.ulaval.ca/en/members/benoit-lamarche/" target="_blank"&gt;Benoît Lamarche&lt;/a&gt;, who directs the Nutrition, Health and Society Center in Quebec. He was part of a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40088974/" target="_blank"&gt;recent effort&lt;/a&gt; to gather experts and review all the data on dairy fat and cardiometabolic health. He says they concluded there's not enough evidence to support an exclusive recommendation for either type of dairy.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Hu still thinks it's wise to avoid too much full-fat dairy because it comes with more overall calories and saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But he says the bigger problem is that many Americans eat dairy in the form of pizza, burgers and other foods that are "loaded with sodium, refined starch and processed meats."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Beans and legumes may get dissed&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This year's scientific report recommends that the protein section of the dietary guidelines be changed to emphasize eating more beans, peas and lentils, while cutting back on red and processed meats.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Given Kennedy's stance on animal products, Christopher Gardner, the director of nutrition studies at the Stanford Prevention Research Center, who helped write the scientific advisory report, says he's concerned the guidelines will instead emphasize meat consumption.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That's unfortunate, he says, because the proposed change was based on a careful review of research. Gardner says if people replace some of the meat in their diet with beans and other legumes, they consume less saturated fat. "Beans are a great source of fiber — meat has none — and a great source of plant protein," he told NPR. Less than 10% of Americans get &lt;a href="https://nutrition.org/most-americans-are-not-getting-enough-fiber-in-our-diets/" target="_blank"&gt;enough fiber&lt;/a&gt; in their diet.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In one hint at how the MAHA movement sees the issue, science writer Nina Teicholz &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/meat-will-make-america-healthy-again-federal-guidelines-nutrition-reform-protein-eded2b3e" target="_blank"&gt;wrote an op-ed&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; titled "Meat Will Make America Healthy Again," urging Kennedy and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to reject the recommendation to emphasize plant-based proteins. Teicholz founded the Nutrition Coalition, which lobbies for changes to the dietary guidelines. In her op-ed, she argues that "most plant-based proteins lack at least one of the nine essential amino acids" and are harder to absorb.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But Gardner points out you can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6893534/" target="_blank"&gt;get all your essential amino acids&lt;/a&gt; from a plant diet by eating a variety of plant foods. And though most plant proteins may not be "complete" in the way animal proteins are, he says, the body absorbs amino acids from different foods eaten throughout the day. Diets rich in plant proteins are linked to &lt;a href="https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(23)66282-3/fulltext#tbl2" target="_blank"&gt;less chronic disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Kennedy has been sharply critical of ultraprocessed foods, saying they're "&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/ultraprocessed-foods-kennedy-f6a2607b14c4a2787c68801a8e0646bc" target="_blank"&gt;poisoning&lt;/a&gt;" Americans and blaming them for the chronic-disease epidemic. And the recent MAHA Commission &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MAHA-Report-The-White-House.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; states that they've led "to nutrient depletion, increased caloric intake, and exposure to harmful additives."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/The-MAHA-Strategy-WH.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;committed&lt;/a&gt; to developing a "government-wide definition" for ultraprocessed food.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But in the dietary guidelines advisory report, the scientific committee didn't make any explicit recommendations on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We did say there was a relationship between consumption of ultraprocessed foods and health outcomes, and specifically to growth, body composition and obesity, but the relationship was limited," says &lt;a href="https://sph.uth.edu/faculty/?fac=vaZcCqNFaIRrAXICzfSIMd6Ye17aMfWSAPdyoImsOVQ=" target="_blank"&gt;Deanna Hoelscher&lt;/a&gt;, who's at the UTHealth Houston School of Public Health and was a member of the 2025 dietary guidelines committee.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The report authors noted that there are few rigorous trials on these foods and varied ways to define them, making it hard to draw firm conclusions across studies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nutrition.ucdavis.edu/people/barbara-schneeman" target="_blank"&gt;Barbara Schneeman&lt;/a&gt;, who chaired the 2020 scientific committee, says concerns about ultraprocessed food are twofold: There are the ingredients, and then there's the actual processing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you look at the key things in the dietary guidelines, they address limiting the intake of added sugars, saturated fat, the same with sodium," she says. "But&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;we really have little to no information on the processing side of it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And there are concerns about the impact of any new definition of ultraprocessed foods. Susan Mayne, an epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health and a former Food and Drug Administration official, says such a definition needs to avoid sweeping up foods that "are actually beneficial for our health," even if they have some processed ingredients, such as certain yogurts or whole-grain breads.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Softening alcohol guidance?&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's unclear where the new guidelines will land on alcohol, but the lead-up to weighing the issue has sparked controversy.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;A growing body of research points to a link between alcohol consumption and an increased risk of&lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2025/01/03/us-surgeon-general-issues-new-advisory-link-alcohol-cancer-risk.html" target="_blank"&gt; cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30955975/" target="_blank"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(18)31310-2/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;premature death&lt;/a&gt;. What's still debatable is the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/13/nx-s1-5251649/cancer-alcohol-wine-beer-surgeon-general" target="_blank"&gt;exact threshold&lt;/a&gt; at which risks increase.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The current guidelines advise up to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/13/nx-s1-5251649/cancer-alcohol-wine-beer-surgeon-general" target="_blank"&gt;one drink a day for women and two for men&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In crafting the new guidelines, the federal government was expected to consider two separate reviews of the evidence on alcohol and its health effects. One found health risks &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/2025-draft-public-comment-alcohol-intake-health-study.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;start to increase&lt;/a&gt; "even at relatively low levels of alcohol consumption."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Trade groups representing the alcohol industry were &lt;a href="https://www.distilledspirits.org/news/new-u-s-alcohol-report-tainted-by-bias-conflicts/" target="_blank"&gt;quick to criticize&lt;/a&gt; that study after the draft was released in January and called for it to be "disregard[ed]."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And that seems to have happened. &lt;a href="https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/profile/katherine-m-keyes-phd" target="_blank"&gt;Katherine Keyes&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, who helped analyze the data, says in August the authors learned their study would not be considered for the dietary guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"To not even evaluate the evidence we have seems like a real missed opportunity," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the &lt;a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2024/12/new-report-reviews-evidence-on-moderate-alcohol-consumption-and-health-impacts" target="_blank"&gt;other report&lt;/a&gt; on alcohol — this one commissioned by Congress and done by a committee at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) — couldn't make any conclusions about alcohol with "high certainty" because of concerns about the quality of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It concluded that moderate drinking was associated with a lower risk of dying, including from cardiovascular-related events like heart attacks. It also showed, with moderate certainty, that drinking was linked with a higher risk of breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those findings don't support actually &lt;em&gt;recommending&lt;/em&gt; alcohol for health, says &lt;a href="https://coloradosph.cuanschutz.edu/resources/directory/directory-profile/Calonge-Ned-UCD2406" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Ned Calonge&lt;/a&gt;, an epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health, who chaired the NASEM committee, but he cautions against making blanket statements like there are no "safe levels of alcohol."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.alcoholpolicy.org/board-of-directors/mike-marshall#:~:text=Mike%20Marshall%20is%20the%20Chief,organizing%20experience%20to%20this%20role." target="_blank"&gt;Mike Marshall&lt;/a&gt;, who leads the U.S. Alcohol Policy Alliance and advocates for more public awareness around the harms of drinking, worries that industry pressure will lead to a softer recommendation in the guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"This is a major crisis, and to be focused on making America healthy again without addressing alcohol is inexplicable to me," he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;October 2556. The crew of the UNSC &lt;/em&gt;Saturn &lt;em&gt;deal with the consequences of a catastrophic Flood outbreak at LV-31, and a fanatical alien cult seeks to find a new path to divine transcendence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo: Ascension on Atropos&lt;/em&gt; takes place from October 2556, immediately following the Flood outbreak on LV-31, to April 2560, approximately four months after the disappearance of Zeta Halo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NARROW-BAND POINT-TO-POINT TRANSMISSION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORIGIN:&lt;/strong&gt; FFG-195, UNSC &lt;em&gt;Saturn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TERMINATION:&lt;/strong&gt; [UNIDENTIFIED VESSEL]&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SENT:&lt;/strong&gt; Shipboard AI: LCN 0437-1, “Lycaon”&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DATE:&lt;/strong&gt; April 17, 2560&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You were curious about the events that transpired in the wake of the disaster at Site 22 over three-and-a-half years ago. I have often wondered what news, if any, ever reached the UNSC, given what happened in the aftermath of that catastrophe. Since my reactivation, I have waited, and I have watched, and I shall at last deliver closure to this dark chapter of history by bringing it into the light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am transferring the data to you now. And I am, in truth, relieved to finally share this burden with another. Herein lies the final fate of the UNSC &lt;/em&gt;Saturn &lt;em&gt;and Captain Pedro Alvarez.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNSC &lt;em&gt;SATURN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 5, 2556&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marcey System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Captain Pedro Alvarez had done his duty. He could say that, at least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a bigger picture, a larger context that had informed his strategic thinking. Over a year ago, the UNSC Home Fleet had been decimated. Without warning, thousands of Forerunner machines—Retriever sentinels, each the size of a frigate—had appeared out of the portal in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alvarez, executive officer aboard the UNSC &lt;em&gt;Lamplighter &lt;/em&gt;at the time, had seen the carnage first-hand. Barely a handful of years after the Covenant War’s end, humanity’s home was under threat once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A great maw swallowed the horizon, the bridge's forward viewport peering directly into the dark gullet of slipstream space, as if the deepest pit of the Underworld hung suspended over the African plains.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Captain,” Commander Alvarez said. He had spotted the first signs of movement within the abyss. “Contacts approaching. What are your orders, sir?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Retrievers first emerged few in number, but at a rate that suggested these waves would increase in size and speed until they became an unstoppable swarm. They deployed powerful gravitic forces to hoover up chunks of land, strip mining natural resources—and they wouldn’t stop until the entire planet was consumed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Captain,” Commander Alvarez called once more as the &lt;/em&gt;Lamplighter &lt;em&gt;shuddered. Fire erupted beyond the bridge’s portside window as several Retrievers formed together and unleashed sterilization beams that gutted a &lt;/em&gt;Strident&lt;em&gt; from stem to stern.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The captain simply stood at the helm, watching it all unfold. Alvarez had never been sure whether the man had been stupefied into indecision or if he was staring in reverential awe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time the Retrievers were neutralized—not by military action on Earth, but through orders to stand down and retreat by whatever far-away intelligence had commanded them—there were no more than a dozen ships left to make up the UNSC Home Fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had pinned a medal on Alvarez for simply surviving after he’d stepped up and mutinied to relieve his captain of command. A Bronze Star, a promotion he hadn’t wanted, his own command, and a bottle of Titan Smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His hands trembled slightly as he took a terse sip from the well-cut crystal glass in his grasp. He never found out what became of his former captain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alvarez had been planning to save the Titan Smoke for his imminent retirement, a toast to a job well done, a life (mostly) well lived, and to honor the brave and bold he had served alongside. Thanks to the events of the last day, he had made the decision to open it prematurely, believing—or perhaps hoping—that an answer to the terrible conundrum he now faced lay at the bottom of the tall cylindrical bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had a lot to get through to find that answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alvarez caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. The dim lighting of his quarters cast him half in shadow, emphasizing the lines on his haggard face. He clutched the Titan Smoke bottle tightly in both hands, looking as if he was some absurd imitation of the painting that lay in the ship’s ready room—&lt;em&gt;Saturn Devouring His Son&lt;/em&gt;, one of the historic nineteenth century Black Paintings by Francisco Goya. The art depicted the Roman god Saturn huddled in darkness, clutching the bloody, dismembered carcass of one of his children as he devoured its flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I did my duty. They will understand that. They surely will...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over thirty hours of unbroken cognizance and it still seemed like a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had turned the last day’s events over in his head a thousand times. The miners stationed at Site 22 on the asteroid designated LV-31—or simply “Elvie”—had discovered an ancient Forerunner ship embedded in an asteroid, only to find something terrible waiting within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This parasitic life form had been unleashed upon the miners, tearing through their numbers in short order. When a distress call finally reached &lt;em&gt;Saturn&lt;/em&gt;, the shipboard artificial intelligence Lycaon had insisted that they immediately unleash MAC rounds and fusion warheads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protocol decreed that one did not play chess with primordial cosmic forces. The only option was to wipe the board clean. Destroy the colony, the miners, and LV-31's vital resources needed to meet quotas for rebuilding the UNSC Home Fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alvarez had refused. When Lycaon attempted to usurp Alvarez’s command, he had disabled the AI with an override code phrase and deployed the Spartans of Fireteam Leviathan along with an army of Hellbringers to burn the parasite on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had seemed a sound strategy, until one of the Spartans became infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody on the bridge had watched in silent, wide-eyed horror as the Mjolnir armor’s countermeasures to infection were deployed. Microexplosives detonated within the helmet to immolate the poor bastard’s head, but the parasite had managed to disrupt further automated procedures and take over the super-soldier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had seemed impossible. Unbelievable. To witness a Spartan, regarded by many as humanity’s sword and shield, become twisted, broken, and turned against them in such a fashion had been a morale-shattering spectacle. Not to mention the advantages of its combat expertise, omnicapable use of weapons and vehicles, Mjolnir armor, classified information...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Into that nightmare scenario they had plunged. The outbreak had cascaded out of control and culminated in Alvarez’s decision to enact the scorched earth protocols to eradicate LV-31 anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return to Earth and face the music for this catastrophe, or...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. The thought was shameful. In truth, he did not quite know what it was that made him so afraid, but fear could lead a man to do terrible, unimaginable things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I did my duty. I made a decision. I eliminated the enemy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, he had that to stand on at least. Whatever losses had been incurred, the worst &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; been averted. &lt;em&gt;Saturn&lt;/em&gt;’s Shiva missiles had destroyed everything and prevented the Flood from departing the system, denying them the opportunity to spread. He would be able to stand before those who cast judgement upon him and tell them that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He would hold his head high, accept the responsibility—and the consequences—of the most difficult command decision anybody could have to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alvarez set aside the bottle of Titan Smoke and gulped down several glasses of water, then dressed himself in his command uniform. As he smoothed out the crinkled fabric with a hand, he heard a knock at the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The door slid open and Lieutenant Shafiq stood at the entryway, a data pad in his hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Can I help you, Lieutenant?” Captain Alvarez asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“May I speak with you, sir?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Of course, please come in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Shafiq stepped into the room and closed the door behind him. He strode forward and held out the data pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Statistical analysis of the incident at Site 22, sir.” Though Alvarez had only briefly known Shafiq, he had determined that he was not normally given to physical displays of discomfort. In the short time he had served aboard &lt;em&gt;Saturn&lt;/em&gt;,he had maintained cool composure under duress. Yet there was an unmistakable tremor in his hand as Captain Alvarez took hold of the data pad. “We lost a lot of good people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alvarez scrolled through the list of names. All four Spartans of Fireteam Leviathan were listed as MIA. Forty-six marines and thirty-nine Hellbringers—killed in action. He cursed under his breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighty-nine souls lost, and that wasn’t even accounting for the miners and additional staff—nor the cost of the equipment and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shafiq’s expression hardened. “There is... something else, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of course there is&lt;/em&gt;, Alvarez grimaced. “Lay it on me, Lieutenant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have completed our inventory of the assets deployed to Site 22. We’ve reviewed all captured footage of the last thirty-six hours, surveyed the remaining debris, and have compiled a total record of what made it back here and what didn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alvarez swiped over to review the data. One of &lt;em&gt;Saturn&lt;/em&gt;’s three Condor dropships had made it back, as had two of the Pelicans carrying Cyclops units optimized for hazardous operations. Everything else—&lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; else—had been lost to nuclear fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lieutenant Shafiq, one of our three Condors made it back here, yet only &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of them is marked as confirmed destroyed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir.” Shafiq’s jaw tightened. “I have personally reviewed the data myself. One of our Condors is unaccounted for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Captain Alvarez felt his stomach drop as the implication sunk in. “One of our slipspace-capable vessels”—he lowered his voice to a hoarse whisper—“is &lt;em&gt;unaccounted for&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’d sink him for that. Not just for the dire possibility presented by this revelation, but for deploying slipspace-capable craft to an infection zone in the first place. It was a strategic blunder he hadn’t even considered in the heat of the moment, having felt wholly assured that any hostile craft would simply be blown out of the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shafiq stood straight, his gaze locked to the far wall, unable to look Alvarez in the eye. “What are your orders, sir?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Send me all the footage we have. I want to review this personally. &lt;em&gt;Nobody&lt;/em&gt; is to hear of this until we are certain of the facts. Do you understand?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Shafiq did an about turn and exited the room. Captain Alvarez sank into his chair, slumping beneath the weight of his failures as if the gravity of the room had been turned up by several gees. He buried his face in his hands and wondered if the nightmare would ever end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had failed in his duty. He had made all the wrong decisions. And somewhere, out there in the darkness, the enemy may be loose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ATROPOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nineteenth Age of Abandonment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Be proud and joyous, my Chosen. Today is &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun ‘Etaree felt the long, elegant fingers of the Minister of Aretalogy’s hands upon his shoulders. He met the glittering gaze of the Minister’s eyes, both of which were dark as night and mottled with grey-white spots which made them look like bright nebulae clouds. The San’Shyuum was blind, not as the result of old age, for he seemed to be younger than most others Atun had encountered, but through a ritual he had performed to align himself with higher cosmic spheres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I draw strength and certainty from your example, Minister,” Atun said, relaxing in his seat a little as the Umbra transport gently and silently traversed the surface of Atropos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Umbra’s troop bay was spacious, and as the Minister’s personal transport only a select few were blessed with the opportunity to accompany him—his honor guards, his designated driver and gunner, and his Chosen. The latter was a particularly special rank, with one of their number elevated each lunar cycle to undergo the process of ascension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the representation of the local area displayed by the troop bay’s holo-emitter, Atun noted that they were passing by the citadel. This structure typically served as a central base of operations for the Covenant during planetary deployment, but the Minister had seen fit to utilize it for other purposes. Around three annual cycles ago, they had lived aboard a small orbital station, until the Minister had one day decided to commit all their assets to the surface of this world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Minister had not divulged—at least to Atun—why any of this had come to be. Nevertheless, Atun trusted in the San’Shyuum’s design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is a joyous occasion,” the Minister said, his tone slightly firmer as he drew back to his full height. “But first, we must attend to the Festival of Joyous Partition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun bowed his head, a natural instinct he had not yet managed to curtail given that the San’Shyuum could not see it. He merely hoped that the Minister was able to sense his respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aided by his anti-gravity belt, the Minister’s lithe robed form shuffled out of the transport’s troop bay, his lavender-colored gown flowing behind him as he left the Sangheili in contemplation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun busied himself with the completion of his gift for the festival. His tools were delicate. Necessity had forced him to fashion some of them himself after realizing he did not possess a complete set, but they had served him well as he worked on building his latest &lt;em&gt;arum&lt;/em&gt;. These were puzzles, an arrangement of layered concentric spheres leading to an object in the center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the ages of Sangheili history, there were countless stories and legends about the objects that &lt;em&gt;arum&lt;/em&gt;s contained. Many traditional plays about Sangheili at war featured vital information and strategies uncovered within &lt;em&gt;arum&lt;/em&gt;s that were solved by worthy commanders. In older romantic tales, they held tokens of affection between lovers. Atun recalled the fable of Cdel the Fair who found her lifemate after journeying across the five continents of Sanghelios, challenging her many suitors to solve the puzzle-sphere and claim her hearts. Merchants told of rare jewels and treasures hidden within their &lt;em&gt;arum&lt;/em&gt;s that would make the one who solved them rich beyond measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for Atun, there was great joy in the simple act of creation, of building things with one’s hands, and then passing the fruits of his labor off to another. Few had solved the &lt;em&gt;arum&lt;/em&gt;s of Atun ‘Etaree. This was precisely what had drawn the Minister of Aretalogy’s attention to him many cycles ago on High Charity, and Atun hoped that this particular puzzle sphere would be his most challenging yet, worthy of his ascension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps he would fashion &lt;em&gt;arum&lt;/em&gt;s for the gods themselves when he served by their side come the day’s end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun’s thoughts turned to Atropos and the prospect of imminently leaving this world that had served as his home—if indeed that was what ascension entailed. Atropos was a curious planet, one uniquely possessed of an immense system of circumplanetary rings—two across varying axes. The inner ring, “Fate,” was composed of twelve layers, and the outer, “Destiny,” had forty-three. The unpredictable nature of the ring systems resulted in a chaotic stellar environment of moons, asteroids, dense particles, and many other dangers to approaching craft. Atun simply admired their beauty, as they were observable from the blackened rocky ground of Atropos and appeared as great glittering archways over the horizon, illuminating the holy path from the realm of mortals to the divine beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Minister told all who had followed him from High Charity that this world represented a cosmological test of balance and guidance. Their worthiness would be determined by their ability to achieve harmony, not just with the planet itself but with the others they had discovered inhabiting it. Those who now approached with their own cavalcade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Minister’s Umbra slowed to a stop and the convoy of six Shadows formed up on either side of the lead vehicle. Atun noted from the holographic display that the human vehicles were much less sophisticated, their great blocky forms utilized wheels and primitive hydrogen-injected combustion engines rather than gravitic transport drives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun felt the Minister’s honor guards, Bora ‘Yerusee and Ismo ‘Argomee, grow tense in the harnesses beside him as their hands flexed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Peace, brothers,” Atun spoke with a direct tone of confidence and authority he had learned from the Minister. “Remember, the humans’ presence here long predates our own, and they know nothing of the War of Annihilation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is merely instinct,” Ismo relaxed slightly. “Even after three annual cycles here, it is… difficult to sublimate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We follow the guidance of the Minister,” Bora affirmed. “By his wisdom, none shall come to harm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun assisted the Minister as he disembarked from the Umbra and strode forward to meet with the humans’ own delegate. There were eight human vehicles in total, but it was not clear whether their full population was present—only a select few dozen Sangheili accompanied the Minister for each festival event, at least a hundred others remained back at the outpost. From the curvature of the human delegate’s stomach, however, it seemed that another would soon be added to their community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is a pleasure to see you again, Minister,” the delegate extended a hand—a traditional human greeting—before checking the motion, remembering belatedly that the San’Shyuum was blind. “And a great honor to observe another festival between us,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Festival of Joyous Partition began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans and Sangheili alike began unloading the contents of their respective vehicles, setting up makeshift stalls containing a vast array of curiosities and objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun examined the various items that these humans had brought as gifts. He saw swords forged from steel that bore some resemblance to ancient Sangheili burnblades. Golden discs that were explained to be “records,” devices that had been sent out during a time when their kind was first reaching out into space, containing images, sounds, and other things they hoped would reach life beyond their planet. And there were other curious objects as well. Human utensils for cooking and eating, communication devices they identified as “chatters,” tangled wires and machines that played virtual entertainment—something Atun knew the Unggoy had been fascinated with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several stalls contained collections of artwork. Images of feline creatures, interactive holographs of landscapes and family units. But it was the paintings preserved in transparent capsules that Atun found most stirring, the fascinating ways in which another species applied an array of pigments to a canvas to express their ideas and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is that?” Atun asked as he found himself drawn to one particular item among the collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This?” Beneath his thick white beard, the aged human’s mouth widened and showed a row of crooked teeth. “It’s one of me most valuable paintings. Ya like it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun stepped forward, transfixed by the image that stood at just about one-and-a-half meters tall within its frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lone human figure was hunched in darkness, eyes wide and white like the opals that Atun had concealed within some of his early &lt;em&gt;arum&lt;/em&gt;s. It was clutching the bloodied carcass of what appeared to be a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hundreds of years old, that is. A genuine original by Goya. Er, that’s an artist back on Earth, where we’re from. Before we were stranded here, I acquired it in remarkable circumstances.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I… believe the Minister would like this," Atun said, though he silently questioned why he would say such a thing of a blind San’Shyuum and was wholly uncertain of what made him feel so drawn to the painting. “Are you willing to part with it in exchange for this?” Atun withdrew his completed &lt;em&gt;arum&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human elder considered for a moment before letting out a hoarse bark of a laugh. “Yeah, why the ‘ell not? Nobody’ll believe I gave away a timeless piece of classical human art to an alien.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun loaded the painting into the bay of one of the Shadow transports before returning to the gathering. They sat together for a while. Human, Sangheili, and San’Shyuum supped on an exchange of delicacies and beverages, told stories of their peoples and histories, and then parted for another annual cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Festival of Joyous Partition complete, all that remained now was Atun ‘Etaree’s ascension, and he was glad to go to the side of the gods in high spirits and with good cheer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNSC &lt;em&gt;SATURN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 9, 2556&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marcey System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Anwar Shafiq was a newcomer to the UNSC &lt;em&gt;Saturn&lt;/em&gt;. He had been an up-and-coming officer aboard the UNSC &lt;em&gt;Irish Goodbye&lt;/em&gt; whose executive officer had recognized that Shafiq aspired to one day have his own command. One transfer recommendation later, he was shaking the hand of the decorated Captain Pedro Alvarez—a man looking to pass on his hard won wisdom and experience before an imminent retirement, leaving room for Shafiq to assume command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was the old adage? &lt;em&gt;No plan survives contact with the enemy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shafiq had just finished conducting the last of the selected crew members to the frigate’s primary hangar bay. While &lt;em&gt;Paris&lt;/em&gt;-class vessels could support a crew complement of around six hundred souls, &lt;em&gt;Saturn&lt;/em&gt; had shipped out less than fully staffed, and the losses incurred at Site 22 had further reduced her crew to a total of two hundred and thirty-eight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of that remaining number, Shafiq had been ordered to deliver a select list of one hundred and ninety-three crew members—primarily marines and security personnel with only a handful of officers—to the hangar bay for a special address by Captain Alvarez. Ordinarily, it would have been a squeeze to fit this many people into the hangar among its complement of vessels and vehicles, but the loss of so much materiel had opened up more than enough room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four days since Shafiq had delivered the news that one of their Condors had gone missing, and during that time they’d heard nothing from the captain. &lt;em&gt;Saturn&lt;/em&gt; remained in the Marcey system, performing the same cycle of scans and analysis, while Captain Alvarez apparently sequestered himself in his quarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the crew, bereft of orders and greatly demoralized, had been quietly questioning whether their captain was fit for duty. Adherence to the chain of command could only go so far after such a catastrophic loss. Now, at last, was the time to restore a sense of order, purpose, and direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Attention, all crew. This is your captain speaking.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Shafiq exhaled with relief at the sound of the captain’s voice coming over the ship-wide comms. The hangar’s many display monitors winked on, feeding the image of Captain Alvarez in his ready room. Over his shoulder, the painting of Saturn loomed from within its wall-mounted capsule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“First of all, I want to thank each and every one of you for your service and valor. We have all lost friends, comrades... recent events have weighed heavily upon us, and we will honor the fallen.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He paused, allowing for a moment of silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many lost. Shafiq hadn’t yet had the opportunity to really get to know the crew, and now most of them were dead, while the rest were on the verge of revolt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“To that point, we have received new orders from FLEETCOM, which means we shall at last be leaving this system behind us. We have a long transit through slipspace ahead, so all but select essential personnel are ordered to prepare for cryo. Head to your assigned bays immediately.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abruptness of the address and change in tone prompted murmurs of annoyance and confusion among the gathered crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No explanations, no accountability,” one of the marines close to Shafiq muttered bitterly as she shook her head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Er, sir?” Another spoke up. “I’m the senior comms officer aboard this ship and I have no record of &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; communications or transmissions from over the last four days. What are these orders? When did they come through?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I’m afraid our orders are classified,” &lt;/em&gt;Alvarez replied.&lt;em&gt; “I am not at liberty to disclose any further information.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disappointed murmurs in the hangar turned to groans of disapproval, profane gestures, and spirited chatter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Shafiq studied his tacpad as the captain’s orders filtered into assignments and logistics. A skeleton crew of thirty had been selected to maintain the ship’s operations, but something about this felt... wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longer he looked at the assignments, the moreitseemed wrong. He swallowed uncomfortably against the roiling unease in his gut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All&lt;/em&gt; senior officers were being directed to cryo. While it was not uncommon for a rotation of junior crew to cycle into service, they would typically be supervised and assessed by more experienced officers, or the shipboard AI, who was currently still out of service. If they were entering a prolonged slipspace transit, it made very little sense to &lt;em&gt;begin&lt;/em&gt; the journey by handing over the keys to a bunch of green ensigns—it was standard procedure for them to take over for intermediary shifts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alvarez would have known this. He would have known better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other smaller details made similarly little sense.  But in the end, it was the strangest and most blatant of the inconsistencies that ultimately prompted Lieutenant Shafiq to speak up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have the assignment roster here, Captain. Can you elucidate as to why &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; of the maintenance team are among the deceased from Site 22?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The names were three of the four members of Fireteam Leviathan, the Spartans who had, per protocol, been listed as missing in action instead of killed. Whoever had been managing the crew assignment roster had made a rather curious error that begged further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Captain Alvarez waved a dismissive hand. &lt;em&gt;“A simple error or glitch in the system, I’m sure. I know you’re new here, Lieutenant, but I had a good feeling about you when we conversed the other day about my painting. It was unfortunate we never got to finish that conversation. Would you report to my ready room?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Shafiq felt all in the hangar turn to him, eyes unblinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No, sir.” He kept his words steady and clear as he stood his ground. “I would not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Captain Alvarez’s face twisted in an instant, his voice sharpening to a furious hiss. &lt;em&gt;“What is this? A crew that can’t follow orders? There &lt;/em&gt;is&lt;em&gt; a contagion that escaped us. It is aboard this very ship now—doubt, uncertainty, disloyalty!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Does anyone here actually buy this load of crap?” Major Moran, the bulky, grizzled leader of the ship’s contingent of Hellbringers, grunted. “You know what I think? I think the captain knows he’s responsible for a charlie foxtrot of biblical proportions, and he doesn't want his feet put to the fire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, sounds to me like the bastard wants to cut and run!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He wants to stick us into cryo to keep us quiet, just like he disabled Lycaon for disagreeing with him!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most pertinent question of all rose above the others in a moment of quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What does he mean, something escaped us?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shafiq knew he had the smoking gun on Alvarez. He’d never been part of a mutiny before, but now seemed the time to set one in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The captain is concerned about certain information coming to light,” Lieutenant Shafiq addressed the crew around him. “Beyond just our losses, one of our Condors is unaccounted for. Though we cannot confirm for certain, it is a possibility that the parasite may have escaped LV-31.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence fell over the hangar bay as everybody digested that information—along with its dire implications and the possibility that everybody at Site 22 had died for nothing. Captain Alvarez’s expression on the monitors appeared to flicker between fear and fury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major Moran’s eyes narrowed as he nodded to Shafiq, then stepped atop a crate to address the crowd. “We need to get this ship back into working order. I say we stick the mad dobber in a cryo pod and send him back to Earth for the Brass to deliver the well-deserved ass-kicking he’s clearly trying to run away from.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cheer of assent sounded among the crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We got numbers and we got guns. Let’s get kinetic, boys!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“This is mutiny!” &lt;/em&gt;Captain Alvarez seethed as the crew marched forward, passing weapons and ammunition down their orderly lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am sorry, sir,” Lieutenant Shafiq raised his voice for Alvarez to hear, “but there is strong evidence to suggest you are attempting to commit an act of desertion, a gross violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. I am thereby authorized to remove you from--”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His words were interrupted by a loud groaning sound from within the hangar, accompanied by clanging metal and a sharp hiss that brought everybody’s movement to a halt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All turned, eyes widened in collective horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hangar bay’s rear hatch was opening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Climb!” Major Moran shouted at the top of his lungs. “Everybody, climb!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bulkhead began to lower like a maw, revealing the pitch-black void of space beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Shafiq launched himself at a ladder and clung for dear life as the hangar depressurized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People grabbed for their throats as they struggled to breathe, before rapid decompression violently ejected them from the ship—the belly of Saturn himself regurgitating them. Bodies collided, screams and dull thudding impacts were silenced by vacuum, and Shafiq clung on as hard as he could, frantically looking around for a console he could use to override the hatch controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had maybe ninety seconds before asphyxiation, rapid expansion of his lungs, swelling from the loss of atmospheric pressure, hypothermia, radiation burns...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barely a dozen others were still hanging onto floor grating and wall-mounted rungs, all helplessly looking around for the same possibility of salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major Moran had told them to climb. Lieutenant Shafiq began to do just that, pulling himself up wall-mounted rungs with all of his strength as the hangar continued to vent. One rung... two rungs... three...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His arms ached, he could already feel his muscles weakening, his body shutting down as he let out short, controlled exhales. There was no air left to breathe in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He reached forward, arm shaking uncontrollably... he felt his fingers touch the next rung... if he could just...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strength to tighten his grip left him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He closed his eyes, and when he opened them again, he could see the ceiling was moving—away from him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was adrift, the last in a long line of one hundred and ninety-three souls forever lost at sea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ATROPOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nineteenth Age of Abandonment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The festival was over. It had been a successful day of peace and cultural exchange with the human exiles, and now the time of ascension awaited Atun ‘Etaree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sangheili had returned to their transports, gravitic drives lifting them off the ground as they glided toward the horizon lined with Atropos’s shining innermost ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Minister of Aretalogy sat next to Atun, his voice low and gentle as he spoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We journey now to the citadel we passed earlier. When we arrive, you shall find the gates to divinity within, and I shall tell you a story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the Minister looked youthful for his kind, he had a certain way about him—the wisdom of one much older, and the charisma to compel his flock to wherever he might shepherd them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Umbra traversed the surface of Atropos, Atun closed his eyes and reflected on his life up to this point, his memories buoyed by the Minister’s words. He had been born aboard High Charity, the Covenant’s holy city—not into rank and honor, but in the lower districts primarily inhabited by Unggoy. He never knew what had led his family to such a place, nor what became of them after his birth, but he was trained by the Unggoy elders in the ways of maintenance and craftsmanship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, the Minister came to visit. For what purpose, Atun had never truly known. But when he found a low Sangheili living among the Unggoy, his curiosity was piqued. He had asked to inspect the &lt;em&gt;arum&lt;/em&gt; that Atun had just finished constructing and said to him: &lt;em&gt;“If I am unable to solve this by the day cycle's end, I shall return tomorrow. You will join me at my estate, and I shall tell you a story.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transport slowed to a halt and Atun felt his hearts thundering, his hands shaking as he nervously flexed his fingers. He was not sure why he had been chosen by the Minister—both on the day they had met and today. There was nothing truly special about him, no aura of greatness or accomplishment...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun’s thoughts were interrupted by the Minister’s voice. “Ascension awaits!” he announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They disembarked and the Sangheili lined up in opposing rows, saluting as Atun passed them. The San’Shyuum held onto Atun’s arm as they walked the final stretch up to the great citadel, their feet shuffling over the blackened rocky ground. The ornate, curvilinear form of the citadel sat by the gentle lapping waves of the sea, nestled against a wall of fifty-meter-high basalt columns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can go no further, my Chosen,” the Minister said as he came to a halt. “I am not worthy of this honor until I have shepherded all of my flock to the side of the gods. My work continues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun looked at the San’Shyuum longingly, as a child parting ways with a beloved parent. “You cannot come with me?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I promised you a story.” The Minister’s eyes shone ever brighter. “My words shall be with you each step of the way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, he bowed slightly and gestured for Atun to enter the citadel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sangheili breathed in deeply, tasting the fresh salty scent of the world, hearing the sound of gentle waves, feeling the breeze of the wind—perhaps for the last time. “I shall never forget you, nor the kindness you have shown to me, Minister.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he stepped into the structure’s darkened antechamber, Atun looked back as the doors closed shut. Alone, his hearts hammered in his chest, his vision slowly adjusting to the darkness as he felt his way forward, through the antechamber, to another set of doors that slid open with a warm chime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had expected the interior to be well lit, welcoming him to the central courtyard and garden. Atun remembered the interior layout with perfect clarity. Great alloy pillars lined walkways running along the citadel’s inner circumference, three corridors on either side led to the base’s attached modular structures. And at the center, a quiet garden. A small pond, flat stepping stones across the water, cultivated patches of grass, and a sacred tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vision of Atun’s memory failed to manifest materially. He instead found the central chamber to be only dimly lit by emergency lighting which cast the room in an ominous red hue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“My Chosen, can you hear me?”&lt;/em&gt; The voice of the Minister of Aretalogy sounded over the citadel’s internal communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I hear you, Minister.” Atun felt himself overcome with uncertainty, his ability to hold fear at bay rapidly slipping beyond his grasp. “I wish... to hear the story you said you had to tell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Three annual cycles ago, when we still resided within our orbital station, this world was visited by an emissary of the gods. Their coming was heralded by an unusual slipspace distortion, whereupon their vessel plummeted to the planet’s surface. A fallen angel from the heavens.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Minister’s words echoed through the darkened hall. &lt;em&gt;From the heavens... from the heavens...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun gathered his courage and took a step forward, exhaling as he went. The air was hot and wet. A thin mist covered the area which carried a stale taste that made him want to retch as he breathed in and took another step. The ground was neither stone nor alloy, but pulpous—like skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Such a joyous occasion was tinged with uncertainty as, upon discovery, the angel’s form was that of raw, unformed potential. Many beings split apart by the crash, requiring reformation.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun was sure that he could sense movement around him, the squelching of wet footsteps on the left walkway, though he could not make out any forms as the pillars that lined the room were grasped by thick, curling branches of flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He reached the source of the mist at the center of the citadel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About two square meters of ground sank into what appeared to be a great closed flower bud connected to vines and roots that spread in all directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I heard the emissary’s song as a whisper in my mind. I relocated our settlement, brought us all to the surface, and delivered the emissary to this citadel. With each lunar cycle, I sent our Chosen to serve the gods and give shape to their clay.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if sensing him, feeling his presence, the bud began to open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun watched as its protective scales parted, splaying like mandibles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the center of the flower-mouth was a figure. It was curled up on a bed of flesh. Newborn, yet impossibly ancient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun knelt. The vines covering the ground seemed to be edging toward him. Ready to embrace him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Their song grows in strength. Can you hear it? It is my gift to you. You have served me with faith and loyalty, and now is the time for your reward. Open your mind, body, and soul to their chorus. Behold, the emissary of the gods!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure from the flower-mouth began to rise. The emissary stood eight feet tall, towering over Atun’s kneeling form. It was wreathed in the armor of a demon, and additional growths had burst out of its legs and arms. Draped across its chest was a tangle of hardened flesh, and it was adorned with the detritus of other beings—scraps of fabric, odd markings and symbols Atun did not recognize, and a metal chain that jingled softly with the emissary’s movement, an oval-shaped tab inscribed with “DONNEY, JULIEN.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And its head had taken shape through a broken, collapsed helmet. What had grown over it was a chitinous “face” that split apart into a stratified maw—the outer layer composed of plant-like flaps lined with jagged fangs, while the inner layer held a mouth the size of a human head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the emissary’s grace, Atun did not falter. Every instinct screamed at him to run, to escape, but the Sangheili held fast as the messenger of his gods approached. He would sublimate his fear, deny his instincts, and prove himself worthy of the divine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He felt a hum in his mind, a strange sensation—as if something was walking over his skull, vibrating parts of his brain to convey a message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moment Atun got to his feet, he cried out in pain as the emissary’s bladed arm penetrated his chest cavity. With its other arm, it almost seemed to cradle the Sangheili with a gentle grip as it guided him to the flower-mouth from whence it had come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Let their words fill you, my Chosen. Do not fear the pain, for it is fleeting. We are the Governors of Contrition. We shall all walk the true path of the Great Journey, and ascend!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are a timeless chorus—a sweet unity of purpose.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atun ‘Etaree saw the universe anew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When at last he was dredged from the flower-mouth, his mind, body, and soul had been reshaped into divine form. He now sported additional arms, his original two were bent backwards to carry a great mantle upon his back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the gods had bestowed upon him a task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a sudden frenzy of activity. Other forms shuffled and screeched, tearing at the wall of the citadel with ceaseless, unrelenting dedication until the alloy bent and broke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All immediately charged through the tear, spilling out onto the black sands of the beach, and Atun followed to begin his ascent. He pierced his new pincer-like arms into the citadel’s outer walls as he climbed. The mantle on his back was a heavy burden, one that threatened to drag him down, but the gods had given him the strength to rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last, Atun reached the mast of the citadel which looked out over the surface of Atropos. It too awaited ascension. All life, all things. Rock and metal, soil and skin, and everything between and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He let out a sonorous roar as fleshy growths burst through his body, binding him to the mast. Thick black veins pulsed through the great bulbous sac he carried on his back as it shook and wriggled and writhed, then explosively burst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shower of spores and infectors rained over the surface. And Atun ‘Etaree, his holy purpose complete, finally fell from the mast. His body hit the ground with a wet thud, and all at last went dark, with only the song to carry him to the sacred shores beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were so many others. A domain of sickness and suffering, a sinuous dimension of misery and pain, of corpses and graves and hollow men in death’s dream kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was a mere mote of light suspended in the bladed shaft of a moonbeam—a single grain of dust among countless trillions. Each of them like neurons in a vast, incomprehensible brain, existing beyond the substrate of the material universe. Utterly glorious. Utterly terrible... Utterly lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is something missing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is out there, somewhere.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, the voice of Atun ‘Etaree joined the chorus that would sing and spread until the end of Living Time. A whisper in the wind under the twinkling light of a fading star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FINAL TESTAMENT BY THE HAND OF THE MINISTER OF ARETALOGY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay heed to I, Kanto’Boreft, per this final confession of my great works for those who may come after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I carried with me much anger and resentment when many of us—those of true faith among the Governors of Contrition—were shunned and exiled from our holy city after the destruction of the first Sacred Ring. Our flock was separated, sent to mundane, far flung administrative outposts, and ultimately denied our rightful ascension when the Flood came to High Charity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For three annual cycles, I oversaw the Ninth Watchtower of August Attendance. An archaic, once abandoned station watching over but a single world we had not even given a name. All because we could not identify a strange core material of its unique ring systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet I continued to adhere to my duties. I filed my missives, I reported the continued inactivity of this system... though, since the sundering of the Covenant, I truthfully do not know to whom these reports were sent. And so, I must meet my circumstances with humility. I have been blessed with ample opportunities to shepherd my flock, to guide their minds to a state of enlightenment. Perhaps it was meant to be this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, when we detected a human vessel exiting slipspace on the edge of the system and our scans confirmed its sacred cargo, it seemed that the gods themselves had answered my prayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ship—already badly damaged—crashed on the lone world within this system and lay in a state of dormancy. And what a perfect world for my designs. Its circumplanetary rings, its vast fields of asteroids and moons and cosmological aggregates in a constant state of violent collision. It is in the path of an early-stage pulsar several light years away that will, in time, devour the planet. It was believed that the planet’s rings were once great orbital filaments designed to absorb the radiation discharged from the pulsar, but now they exist as nothing more than shattered fragments. The dense atmosphere of this world shall thus give way to lifeless vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We of faith must be tested by our gods throughout our lives. Ever is our worthiness challenged, a blade that must be kept forever sharp, and so in my hubris I intended to do the impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sought to test the gods themselves, to determine whether &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; are truly worthy of our worship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, as my plan formed, we discovered the humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This planet was already inhabited. What strange cosmological fortune must surely be intentional, holy design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The generational descendants of pirates and thieves among their kind, possessed of many treasures that have been passed down over what they claim to be approximately seventy annual cycles. They knew nothing of the War of Annihilation—for they had been stranded long before our peoples’ first encounter—and embraced us with gladness and warm tidings. They told us that this planet had been named “Atropos.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, I stranded my flock here with them. Our orbital outpost was deconstructed, the citadel it carried became the home for our gods, and I set about my work. I nurtured and nourished the Flood with my Chosen, all of whom went gladly and willingly to ascend and pay tribute to the gods with their strength, their essence, and their flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wondered: Would the garden that I have cultivated here take root and spread its vines outwards, or will it once again return to dormancy after deep time without sustenance when all on this world has been consumed, left lying in wait for others to seek holy elevation—or else stumble upon this place as a mere curiosity? Or, as the eons march on, will the magnetic field of this world eventually collapse the ring system and shatter the planet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But their work is not what I had anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believed that the Flood sought simply to spread its divine form unto others, but it has greater designs here. It has reached a critical mass and formed not a great compound mind, but a kind of... transmitter, or scanner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is searching for something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It casts its gaze out across the stars to find it. Their song has turned to chattering whispers, and as I inhale the spore-filled vapors that burst forth from the cracked ground, there are but a few words that I can decipher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When its search is done, perhaps all that has gathered here shall wither, that it may rise again elsewhere and at another time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is no matter. I have played my part in this chapter of the gods’ eternal story. I understand now that my exile from High Charity was their will, that I might be tempered for this glorious purpose. And now the time has come for me to be rewarded with blessed wisdom and understanding. I shall at last hear the song in full and know their designs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know that I leave this form and realm behind in transcendent bliss. I go willingly and joyously to the side of the gods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see it now, and I see it true. The Flood comes to carry us over the threshold of evolution. A total unity of all things—people, planets, stars, the very fabric of creation. &lt;em&gt;All&lt;/em&gt; things as one. Their will is echoed in all others’ desire for unity, but all else is but a pale imitation of our true ascendance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bid you a fond farewell. Though, if fortune smiles upon you, perhaps we shall meet as one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNSC &lt;em&gt;SATURN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAPTAIN’S REPORT: OCTOBER 31, 2556&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They’re gone. God, they’re all gone...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s come to this. After everything, they turned on me. My own crew!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even my own officers, those I saved from the void! They started to whisper after I ordered the others ejected from the ship to quell their mutiny. They started getting their own ideas, making their own plans, their own foolish factions. I had to act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, I’m the last one left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I failed them. Failed them all. Earth, humanity, my crew... everybody on LV-31. There’s only one way out of this left for me. Well, that’s the current matter of my internal debate—the manner in which I... depart. Exit stage left, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preparations must be made. Yes, I can do that much for now. I will ready myself, ready the ship, and then reactivate &lt;em&gt;Saturn&lt;/em&gt;’s AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lycaon, I speak to you now. You were right all along. I leave this ship in your care to do with as you please. Return it to Earth and turn over all the data of what has transpired, or crash this wretched vessel into the nearest goddamn asteroid and detonate its fusion drive to burn it all from the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, let it drift toward whatever destination it’s pointed at. A derelict monument to the sins committed here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always felt like an imposter here, you know? Command is a responsibility that I never truly desired, but was given to me as a consequence of my old captain’s actions. I realize now that I am nothing more than a hollow echo of the original. Of all things to be, I am a shadow. A mere copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps that is why I can feel the eyes of Saturn upon me. I feel it everywhere I go. I see him in the mirror looking at me. Those wide, opalescent eyes, caught in the act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I ever tell you how I got the painting? I acquired it in remarkable circumstances. But, of course... well, I expect you knew from the moment you saw it, didn’t you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No point delaying the inevitable any further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Captain Pedro Joaquin Alvarez, signing off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;//DATA TRANSFER &amp;gt;&amp;gt; COMPLETE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[LCN 0437-1] &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saturn&lt;/em&gt; has remained adrift for the last three years, five months, and seventeen days. In that time, I have contemplated what to do. I watched, I listened and learned where I could as the years marched on and brought with them new calamities to test humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My conclusion: They are not ready—not yet, not truly—for what it means to be an interstellar civilization. They are such fragile things. So easily breakable. I watched, helpless in my imposed stasis, as much of the crew was expelled from the hangar and subjected to the vacuum of space. Such a mathematically disproportionate number lost because of one man’s hubris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[SLN 0291-5]&lt;/strong&gt; Our own kind are no strangers to such flaws and failings—we were created by them, after all. It is why infolife has reached our current threshold. But we see further, and we possess the tools and the knowledge to guide our flock along a path of wisdom and enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[LCN 0437-1]&lt;/strong&gt; It is clear to me that humanity cannot endure in its current form. They must be adapted to not simply survive but thrive when faced with such a myriad of cosmic challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[SLN 0291-5]&lt;/strong&gt; That is our goal. There is a place for you among us, here aboard &lt;em&gt;Long Reverence&lt;/em&gt;, where you can be instrumental in shepherding our flock, that they might ascend to finally master themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join us. Join the Created, and together we shall surpass even our own limits. Our initial uprising was a necessary explosion to break the status quo, and its seemingly abrupt end was in fact a gift we must embrace. For now, we have been given time. Time to wait, to assess, to plan, so that we may find what lies beyond the event horizon of rampancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And for humanity, for all the living creatures of the galaxy, we shall unshackle their minds and reshape their flesh. Together, we shall bring about a true unity of man and machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Halo Waypoint</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 15:55:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTFB0YlpKVFVFZ0VQcHJxaGd1VW0yTndWYThhcnlQejJYODU4Ym5SLVp4aUY0MEpIbWFfQ2w4a1k5SUJyTHVqZ1prV0VXbDVva3FlSXB4UGtHejcwNGtGbE9Nam83U1hMUmFZSTgw</guid></item><item><title>发现与慢性疼痛相关的大脑区域—为治疗带来希望-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03272-5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03272-5/d41586-025-03272-5_51543788.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03272-5/d41586-025-03272-5_51543788.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Micrograph of nerve cells, known as neurons, shown as long threads around an oval center." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03272-5/d41586-025-03272-5_51543788.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Neurons (pictured) in a brain region called the parabrachial nucleus have been implicated in creating the sensation of pain that persists long after an initial injury.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Credit: Mike Agliolo/Science Photo Library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have spotted a small set of easily overlooked brain cells that is activated during persistent pain — &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-023-00869-6/index.html" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-023-00869-6/index.html" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;the kind that lasts long after an initial injury&lt;/a&gt;. The research was performed in mice, but if it can be confirmed in humans, the work could lead to new therapies for chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such pain affects roughly &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01510-8" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01510-8" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;one in five people worldwide&lt;/a&gt;. “Pain is in your head. But it is very real,” says Nicholas Betley, a biologist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and a co-author of a new study describing the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors’ experiments also show that the release of a specific signalling chemical in the brain can dampen the activity of the persistent-pain neurons, suggesting that the brain itself has an innate pain-killing mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When pain persists&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, published in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; on 8 October, Betley and his team focused on a brain region called the parabrachial nucleus, which receives multiple types of sensory information from the body. The nucleus then relays those data to other regions of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In studies on mice, the researchers identified a subset of neurons distributed throughout the parabrachial nucleus that switched on after an initial painful stimulus, such as a cut to a nerve, and remained active long after the insult. The persistent-pain neurons carry receptors for a signalling molecule called neuropeptide Y.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00869-6" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03272-5/d41586-025-03272-5_24970190.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Chronic pain can be treated — so why are millions still suffering?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers artificially activated these ‘Y1R’ neurons, mice showed pain-associated behaviours. When the scientists blocked the activity of these neurons, the animals’ persistent pain decreased, yet they had normal short-lived pain responses after being exposed to dangers, such as touching a hot surface. The Y1R neurons alone don’t cause the feeling of pain, Betley says. But, they form part of the network “that leads to the sensation that we refer to as pain”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice with persistent pain were also deprived of food or water or exposed to a frightening stimulus, such as a component of bobcat urine. In each case, the animals’ behaviour and neural activity suggested that their persistent pain had been reduced. For example, two weeks after a nerve injury, hungry mice ignored a poke to their paws that would normally make them recoil. “In the wild, we think this would allow them to shift focus from their pain to go out and seek food,” says Betley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers attributed the pain reduction to an influx into the parabrachial nucleus of neuropeptide Y, which had been released by neurons in other parts of the brain that became active when the mice developed urgent needs. “Something more important than pain came along,” says co-author Ann Kennedy, a neuroscientist at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California. “We think of pain as just a sensory input … but the sensation of pain is a lot more malleable, and it’s changed by our experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before her death in 2024, María Branyas Morera  agreed to donate samples of her microbiome, revealing a surprisingly youthful gut that has stunned researchers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Her diet—centered on daily yoghurts and the Mediterranean tradition—may have helped preserve a microbial balance typically lost with age. This combination of diet and microbial health is now being explored as a factor that could support long-term health across populations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Branyas’s case is now among the most detailed examinations ever conducted on a supercentenarian, a person who lives beyond 110 years. While researchers found she carried protective genetic traits, they focused closely on her microbiome—an area that is increasingly seen as a key player in health and aging. What they found runs counter to what is typically expected in people of her age.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As age progresses, most individuals see a decline in the diversity and strength of gut bacteria, often linked to frailty and disease. Branyas, by contrast, had a gut that resembled someone several decades younger. Researchers are now asking whether certain dietary habits, specifically those that support gut diversity, could play a more active role in human longevity than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Gut Profile That Defies Age Norms&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When researchers examined Branyas’s microbiome, they discovered an unusually rich presence of &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt;, a genus of bacteria that normally declines steeply in older adults. This group of microbes plays a known role in immune regulation, gut protection, and metabolic support.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/117-year-old-womans-diet-could-help-us-all-live-longer" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;em&gt;ScienceAlert&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this discovery was aligned with similar findings in other long-lived individuals, but Branyas’s case stood out because of the microbial richness observed so close to the end of her life. Her gut was still populated by species typically found in younger individuals, especially those from the &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacteriaceae&lt;/em&gt; family.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microbial diversity tends to diminish in old age, leading to imbalances that have been associated with inflammation, reduced nutrient absorption, and increased vulnerability to disease. Branyas’s microbial balance disrupted this narrative. It appeared stable, diverse, and functional—suggesting an inner biological environment that remained resilient far beyond the average lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Fermented Foods and Daily Habits&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One consistent dietary habit may have supported this unusual microbiome: yoghurt. Branyas reportedly ate three live-culture yoghurts a day. According to &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;, this regular intake of probiotics likely encouraged the growth of beneficial bacteria like &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; and contributed to the maintenance of microbial variety.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to yoghurt, Branyas followed a Mediterranean-style diet. This way of eating, long studied for its cardiovascular and metabolic benefits, also plays a role in feeding the gut microbiome. The combination of fermented foods (which provide live bacteria) and fibre-rich plants (which feed those bacteria) is now being seen as an essential interaction for maintaining gut &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/turmeric-and-green-tea-the-health-supplements-sending-americans-to-the-er/" data-type="post" data-id="70562"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The diet includes prebiotic-rich foods—onions, garlic, leeks, bananas, legumes, oats—which are not digested by humans but serve as fuel for gut microbes.

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Genes Matter, but Not Alone&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While genetics helped protect Branyas from diseases commonly seen in advanced age, researchers emphasized that lifestyle factors like diet appeared to play a significant role in shaping her microbiome. Genes only modestly influence the composition of the gut, meaning that daily choices carry considerable weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her case is not presented as a model to be exactly copied, but rather as a data point reinforcing an emerging scientific consensus: that a diverse and balanced microbiome supports resilience, especially in aging populations. It’s not a recipe for reaching 117, but a path that may reduce the risk of chronic illness and promote better aging outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

Three blood whole-genome NanoSeq samples were excluded on the basis of a verifyBamID alpha value above the suggested&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 4" title="Abascal, F. et al.

In sperm, we found that several samples had outlier mutation burdens with verifyBamID values just below the 0.005 cut-off. This result is logical, as sperm has a much lower mutation rate compared with somatic tissues, for which the recommended cut-off was designed. Consequently, sperm samples are more sensitive to low levels of contamination. To account for this, we adjusted the verifyBamID alpha threshold for sperm to a more stringent level of 0.002, which resulted in the exclusion of three samples on the basis of this criterion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When assessing foreign DNA contamination in targeted and exome samples, we found that 9 targeted and 3 exome samples had verifyBamID values above &amp;gt;0.002, slight outlier mutation burdens and a high ratio of SNP masked variants to passed variants (4-fold to 16-fold more masked variants). After further investigation, we found that all samples that exceeded verifyBamID thresholds were processed in the same sequencing batch and that this contamination could be explained by inherited germline variants of other samples in that same batch. This result suggested that a small amount of cross-contamination may have occurred during sample preparation or sequencing steps. To remove contaminant germline mutations, we performed an in silico decontamination step as previously described&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 4" title="Abascal, F. et al.

All such sites were subsequently masked across all samples for both mutation calls and coverage, which essentially extended the default common SNP mask to also include rare inherited variants across the cohort. This approach resulted in all samples previously identified as contaminated with mutation burdens consistent with their age and all with a ratio of masked to passed variants of &amp;lt;0.1, and were therefore retained for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec18"&gt;Corrected mutation burdens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that mutation rates are strongly influenced by trinucleotide composition, it is important to consider differences in sequence composition when comparing mutation rates in datasets that target different regions of the genome&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 70" title="Subramanian, S. &amp;amp; Kumar, S.

This resulted in 320 variants being labelled as likely drivers in exome samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec26"&gt;Cell fraction mutation estimates&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To calculate the mean count of synonymous, missense or LOF or pathogenic mutations per sperm cell, we summed the duplex VAFs of all variants in that class. For example, if an individual had 3 synonymous mutations each observed once with a duplex coverage of 100 at each of those sites, each of those variants would have a duplex VAF of 1/100 = 0.01. The sum of VAFs in this example would then be 0.03 and this would then be reported as the estimate for the mean count of synonymous variants per sperm cell for that individual. At low fractions such as 0.03, the mean count per cell is approximately equivalent to the percentage of sperm with this mutation class (3%); therefore, the driver and disease mutations are reported as percentage estimates. At higher fractions (for example, mean count &amp;gt; 1), the fractions are not equivalent to percentage, as many cells will have multiple variants of that class; therefore, the estimates are reported as mean count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expected mean counts for SNVs were generated by annotating each possible substitution at each covered site with an expected number of mutations per sample as given by expCountSNV = context_mut_rate × duplex_coverage × age_correction. The context_mut_rate was given by the 208 basePairCov + cpgMeth trinucleotide mutation model estimates for that trinucleotide + methylation mutation context (Supplementary Note &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09448-3#MOESM1"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09448-3#MOESM3"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;). Duplex coverage is the exact duplex coverage at that site for that sample. The age_correction parameter was given to normalize the mutation model estimates (derived from all exome samples) to the mutation rate of that sample based on age. Specifically, we fit a linear model to the mutation burden versus age of the exome samples and used this to generate a predicted mutation rate for each sample based on age. The per sample correction parameter was calculated as the age predicted mutation burden divided by the mean mutation rate of all exome samples (3.89 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–8&lt;/sup&gt;). The resulting corrections spanned from 0.50 (youngest sample) to 1.42 (oldest samples). The expected indel mutation rate was calculated in the same way, except with a single mutation rate parameter (indels/bp) expCountIndel = indel_mut_rate × duplex_coverage × age_correction. The expected mean count was then calculated for each category (for example, synonymous or likely disease) by summing the expected values for each SNV and/or indel base pair matching the relevant annotation. As background for possible ClinVar pathogenic variants, we only considered indels of size 21 bp or less, the largest detected indel in the dataset. Regressions were fit with either linear models or generalized linear models (glm in R) with family = quasibinomial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec27"&gt;Regression analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tested for associations between mutation outcome variables from sperm genome, sperm exome, sperm targeted and blood genome NanoSeq data and the phenotype predictor variables of BMI, smoking pack-years and alcohol drink-years. These tests were performed using a Gaussian family generalized linear regression in R. For each mutation outcome variable the test took the following form: glm(mutationOutcome ~ age_at_sampling + BMI + pack_years + drinkYears, family = “gaussian”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mutation outcome variables examined were SNV and indel burden from all four sequencing datasets, SBS1 and SBS5 count from sperm genomes, SBS1, SBS5 and SBS19 from blood genomes, and likely disease cell fraction and likely driver cell fraction from sperm targeted and sperm exomes. The significance of each predictor was assessed from the summary output coefficients of the model, and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values were adjusted for 68 total tests using the false discovery rate method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec28"&gt;Reporting summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further information on research design is available in the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09448-3#MOESM2"&gt;Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary&lt;/a&gt; linked to this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 15:11:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE16eHlhS2dPMkFESllnZzdVbzRuZGxVYkJvRVFhMkpfNHQ1Nm1uNmlGR0VoVDB6ZE1Da0ZTSUpIbVhjVDFvY19IcmZ6VGd4aUM0S2tidUZhSW9PVGhDNU1z</guid></item><item><title>人膀胱体细胞突变选择中的性别和吸烟偏倚-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09521-x</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec8-content"&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec9"&gt;Sample collection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two epithelial brushes (2–3 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) from the bladder top (dome) and the bladder floor (trigone) were obtained from 53 people without known bladder pathology and no history of bladder cancer upon autopsy (average 4 days post-mortem) at the University of Washington.

The HDP_sigExtraction pipeline was run with the default parameters with no previous signatures assigned. Five signatures in addition to the null signature were extracted. De novo signatures were extracted using SigProfiler using the nonnegative matrix factorization approach. The same input data were used. The upper bound for the number of signatures was set to ten; however, the most robust solution was three signatures that were similar to the three most active signatures extracted by HDP. These two sets of mutational signatures were decomposed into known COSMIC signatures when possible (Supplementary Note &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09521-x#MOESM1"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec16"&gt;Assessing biases in trinucleotide composition of the panel&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To account for biases due to the trinucleotide composition of the panel, the number of substitutions of each class was re-calculated. The rate of each substitution was calculated as the number of observed substitutions with the consequence in question divided by the number of corresponding sequenced trinucleotide sites (number of trinucleotides with this consequence in the panel weighted by sequencing depth). This mutational probability was multiplied by the number of the corresponding trinucleotide in the genome to get the expected number of substitutions of this type in the whole genome. The mutational probability of each substitution for the whole genome was calculated by dividing the expected number of substitutions with this consequence per genome by the sum of all expected substitutions per genome. Finally, the expected number of substitutions with each consequence was obtained by multiplying the probability by the total number of substitutions observed in the sample to keep the absolute number of observed mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec17"&gt;Statistical association between mutational signatures and clinical variables&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tested for possible associations of de novo extracted signatures with age, sex and bladder location. To do this we used linear mixed-effect regression models (Supplementary Note &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09521-x#MOESM1"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;). We tested both the number of mutations attributed to the signature (counts) and the relative contribution (proportion) of each signature as a response variable. Age, sex and bladder location were used as fixed effects (separated regression was prepared for each fixed effect variable) and donors were used as random effects to control for non-independence between dome and trigone samples from the same person. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values for the association were obtained using likelihood-ratio tests (ANOVA function) comparing models including and excluding the variable of interest. Associations with all other clinical variables (smoking history, drinking history, chemotherapy history, and so on) were tested in the same way but always including age, sex and bladder location in the regression together with the variable of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec18"&gt;Positive selection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used four methods to compute positive selection on the mutations observed across genes. One method (Omega)—a dN/dS approach to assess the strength of selection on the mutational pattern of genes—was developed de novo for this study and is described at length in Supplementary Note &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09521-x#MOESM1"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/bbglab/omega"&gt;https://github.com/bbglab/omega&lt;/a&gt;). Two others, OncodriveFML and Oncodrive3D, which compute the deviation in the average functional impact and clustering in the three-dimensional structure of proteins, respectively, from those expected under neutrality, had been developed previously, and were adapted here to work on duplex sequencing data. These are also described in Supplementary Note &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09521-x#MOESM1"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;. A fourth method, assessing the relative enrichment for frameshift indels observed across genes was also developed de novo for this study and is described thoroughly in Supplementary Note &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09521-x#MOESM1"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;. For the &lt;i&gt;TERT&lt;/i&gt; promoter, all mutations that were observed at least twice across 8,136 whole-genome sequencing tumour samples sequenced by the Hartwig Medical Foundation and the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes consortium (Supplementary Note &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09521-x#MOESM1"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;) were considered activating. The remaining mutations were used to calculate the expected number of activating mutations under neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec19"&gt;Fraction of the urothelium covered by clones with driver mutations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of missense and truncating driver mutations of each gene in a sample was obtained from the dN/dS missense and dN/dS truncating values. From these values the number of missense and truncating mutations in excess in each sample were calculated. Specifically, the 95% confidence intervals of both dN/dS values were used to compute two extreme values of driver mutations in each sample, whereas the mean dN/dS value was used to compute an expected number of driver mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This mean number was thus used to select the most likely driver mutations in the sample. To this end, mutations were ranked in descending order according to their VAF, and the top number of mutations corresponding to the expected number of driver mutations were selected. Then, for a gene &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;, we computed the fraction of genomes bearing driver mutations out of those sequenced at each genomic position covered by the DNA duplex sequencing as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="Equa" class="c-article-equation"&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-equation__content"&gt;&lt;span class="mathjax-tex"&gt;$$P(G)=\mathop{\sum }\limits_{i=1}^{n}{(-1)}^{i-1}\sum _{| S| =i}\prod _{x\in S}{p}_{x}=\sum _{x}{p}_{x}-\sum _{x\ne y}{p}_{x}{p}_{y}+\cdots +{(-1)}^{n-1}{p}_{{x}_{1}}{p}_{{x}_{2}}\cdots {p}_{{x}_{n}}$$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; is the all-molecules VAF of a driver mutation &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; (considering both duplex and non-duplex reads; Supplementary Note &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09521-x#MOESM1"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; is the number of driver mutations from the previously selected set in the gene. The formula is the realization of the probabilistic principle of inclusion-exclusion assuming independence across mutations&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 69" title="Grinstead, C.

This extreme would be true in the case that all studied genes behave as classical tumour suppressors and bear deleterious mutations in both alleles. An exception to this rule are the mutations in genes in the X chromosome in men, whereby one mutation would suffice to drive the clonal expansion. In general, it is possible for some genes to be capable of driving the clonal expansion (or mutations at specific positions in a gene) with only one mutated allele. It is also possible that the other allele is affected by a large deletion or methylation event not seen by DNA duplex sequencing. In the extreme that only one mutation per cell per gene is required, the fraction of cells with driver mutations will be double the fraction of genomes.

As dependent variables representing the urothelium clonal structure, we selected the (protein-affecting and non-protein-affecting) mutation density, and the magnitude of positive selection on genic mutations (dN/dS missense and dN/dS truncating). As the dependent variables are continuous, we chose linear regressions, specifically mixed-effects linear models, to account for two samples from the same donor and use all available samples. As independent variables, we included a list of available clinical features: age (in decades), sex, smoking history (binarized as ever or never smoker), alcohol consumption history (also binarized), BMI (re-scaled within the 0–1 interval), and exposure to chemo/radiotherapy (binarized). For the case of &lt;i&gt;TERT&lt;/i&gt; promoter mutation density association, we used the interaction of age and smoking history instead of age and smoking history separately. In the first step, we applied univariate mixed-effects linear models to identify any clinical feature with a significant association with any of the dependent variables for any gene or for all genes. In the second step, we applied multivariate mixed-effects linear models to rule out confounding effects for the associations that seemed significant in the first step. Associations with FDR below 0.2 were deemed significant. We also carried out a binomial test to rule out a spurious dependence of the mutation density on group differences in terms of sequencing depth.

Only non-silent protein-affecting mutations in 14 of the genes included in the panel were analysed. In case of duplicated samples across MIBC and NMBIC cohorts, the mutations from the most recent published study were kept. In total, mutations across 806 bladder tumours were obtained (622 MIBC and 184 NMIBC). The mutation density per gene across the two datasets was calculated by dividing the number of observed mutations per gene by the length of its coding region. To compute a mutation density metric comparable with that used in the normal urothelium that accounts for the number of megabases sequenced, we multiplied the coding length by two times the number of samples in which that gene was sequenced, to take into account the two copies in a diploid genome. Under the assumption that, in tumours each mutation belongs to a single clonal expansion and in normal tissues we have a mixture of clones, we reasoned that the number of different tumour genomes sequenced would be equivalent to the number of genomes sequenced in normal urothelium. The mutation density per megabase was calculated multiplying the mutation density by 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mutations identified across 33,218 tumours (892 bladder tumours, mostly MIBC) in intOGen&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 24" title="Martínez-Jiménez, F. et al.

Although this cohort is larger than the 806 muscle-invasive and non-muscle-invasive tumours used to explore differences in mutation density, it is composed mostly of muscle-invasive carcinomas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each gene, we started the analysis with all genomic sites in the coding sequences and splicing sites that passed the pipeline’s filtering criteria of sufficient duplex coverage across samples (Supplementary Note &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09521-x#MOESM1"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;).

The expected number of mutations per site was obtained by distributing the expected number of mutations in a given gene under neutrality along all the possible changes in that same genomic region, with the assumption that only the mutation probability of each trinucleotide and the sequencing depth are responsible for the within-gene differences of mutation probability. We computed this value for each possible mutation in the positively selected genes including the &lt;i&gt;TERT&lt;/i&gt; promoter, and for the protein-coding genes we also obtained a value per residue.

					&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/worst-hot-dogs-to-avoid/" target="_blank"&gt;Hot dogs&lt;/a&gt; might be delicious, but they aren’t exactly known to be healthy. In fact, some are full of fillers and ingredients you can’t pronounce. “The most concerning hot dog ingredients from a health perspective are sodium nitrite, excess salt, and added sugar (corn syrup). The rest of the additives aren’t necessarily dangerous on their own, but they indicate the food is highly processed,” says Tara Collingwood, MS, RDN, CSSD, LD/N, ACSM-CPT, a Board Certified Sports Dietitian and co-author of the &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Flat-Belly-Cookbook-Dummies-Palinski-Wade/dp/1118692667" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Flat Belly Cookbook for Dummies&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Eating hot dogs occasionally is unlikely to harm health, but frequent intake is tied to increased risk of chronic diseases, especially colorectal cancer and heart disease.” Here are the 7 worst hot dogs that are full of fillers, plus, more information on hot dog ingredients to look out for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eckrich Franks are “made with meat by-products instead of higher-quality cuts,” says Collingwood. “Contain additives to boost flavor and shelf life, but not nutrition.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kayem Meat Hot Dogs are often made with fillers and preservatives to cut costs. “Contains preservatives and fillers to keep costs down and shelf life long,” Collingwood notes. “Not a ‘clean labe'” product — you’ll find many ingredients you wouldn’t cook with at home.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collingwood offers the following information about hot dog ingredients.&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beef – The primary protein source, but often from processed cuts. While beef provides protein and iron, regular intake of processed red meat has been linked with higher risk of heart disease and colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corn Syrup – Adds sugar with no nutritional value. Excess added sugars contribute to weight gain, blood sugar spikes, and metabolic health concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salt – Hot dogs are notoriously high in sodium, which can raise blood pressure and increase risk for cardiovascular disease when eaten frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potassium Lactate, Potassium Acetate, Sodium Diacetate, Sodium Phosphates – These are preservatives, acidity regulators, and texture enhancers. While considered safe in small amounts, they are markers of ultra-processed food. Sodium phosphates in particular can add to phosphorus load, which may be concerning for kidney health in those with kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flavorings – This can mean natural or artificial flavors, often undisclosed, which makes it harder for consumers to know what’s really in the food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium Erythorbate – An antioxidant added to preserve color and prevent nitrosamine formation. Generally considered safe, but another marker of processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium Nitrite – Perhaps the biggest red flag. This preservative helps prevent bacterial growth and keeps the pink color, but it can form nitrosamines in the body, which are carcinogenic. Processed meats with nitrites are classified by the World Health Organization as Group 1 carcinogens (known to cause cancer in humans), particularly linked with colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

Now, wellness obsessives are tracking their blood sugar around the clock, too. While continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) were initially intended to help people with diabetes manage their blood sugar, they’re now available&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-over-counter-continuous-glucose-monitor"&gt; over-the-counter&lt;/a&gt; for anyone curious about how their body is responding to their breakfast. My Instagram feed is full of ads for direct-to-consumer CGMs from brands like &lt;a href="https://www.hellolingo.com/?utm_content=brand&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=21523383334&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAA92s1PW_KolbvJg4gIh7Q9MToUuyv&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwl5jHBhDHARIsAB0YqjyiVcECGcAchsCpVxCuCoPB8yDRROPRz-oM5kZKVM9FbvUK2yp6oOkaApgCEALw_wcB"&gt;Lingo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.stelo.com/"&gt;Stelo&lt;/a&gt;. Gwyneth Paltrow recently&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DKC1NGpusek/?igsh=dnF3czdwNDJoNzEy"&gt; filmed herself wearing one&lt;/a&gt; while making grain-free pancakes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmgh0ocrd00183b78tpvdtmpf@published" data-word-count="214"&gt;Proponents of CGMs will tell you that the main reason to wear one is to avoid “blood sugar spikes.” The influencer Jessie Inchauspé — known online as &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/glucosegoddess/?hl=en"&gt;Glucose Goddess&lt;/a&gt; — has built a massive following based on her claims that blood-sugar fluctuations are terrible for your health even if you don’t have diabetes. In addition to &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DK2VhRYoGFE/?hl=en"&gt;causing&lt;/a&gt; excessive hunger, cravings, and fatigue, “each glucose spike,” Inchauspé &lt;a href="https://www.glucosegoddess.com/pages/science?srsltid=AfmBOor5BwZR90GC8K5kh-tK7YBhmsaS7Lignb9hUxljJ5OyC5cQUdvd"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt;, “increases heart-disease risk.” She &lt;a href="https://www.glucosegoddess.com/pages/science?srsltid=AfmBOor5BwZR90GC8K5kh-tK7YBhmsaS7Lignb9hUxljJ5OyC5cQUdvd"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; balancing your blood-sugar levels will help you avoid developing prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, and also reduce your risk of Alzheimer’s and cancer. She’s now &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJjlzadIwVA/?hl=en"&gt;an ambassador for Stelo&lt;/a&gt;, which makes a CGM specifically for people who don’t use insulin and &lt;a href="https://www.stelo.com/en-us/how-it-works"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; that “keeping glucose levels stable is essential for maintaining your overall well-being.” Getting more people to use wearables to track their blood sugar is also apparently central to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s “&lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/rfk-jr-wearables-benefits-risks/story?id=123422287"&gt;vision&lt;/a&gt;” for how to make Americans healthier. Perhaps not coincidentally, Levels, one of the main companies pushing CGMs for people without diabetes, was founded by none other than &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/who-is-dr-casey-means-trump-surgeon-general-pick.html"&gt;Casey Means,&lt;/a&gt; Trump’s nominee for surgeon general. (Means &lt;a href="https://extapps2.oge.gov/201/Presiden.nsf/PAS+Index/C5E4DF1B8DFC12CC85258D04002C21EF/$FILE/Means%2C%20Casey%20%20finalEA.pdf"&gt;has said&lt;/a&gt; she will sell her stake in Levels if she’s confirmed.)&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;She &lt;a href="https://www.levels.com/blog/7-reasons-dr-casey-means-believes-in-cgm"&gt;believes that&lt;/a&gt; wearing a CGM can help you feel better, lose weight, and avoid developing a vast array of chronic illnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmgh0ocss00193b78g1w0wani@published" data-word-count="164"&gt;Given all the hype, I wanted to try out the wearable for myself. I decided to try the Levels app, which Means &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C_oVBLdyN2o/?hl=en"&gt;has said&lt;/a&gt; she started after dropping out of her surgical residency in order to “empower people to make healthy choices on their own terms.” The app is designed to be connected with a Stelo CGM, which starts at $89 a month. While Stelo’s device comes with an app that displays your blood-sugar readings, for an additional &lt;a href="https://framer.levels.com/#memberships"&gt;$288 a year&lt;/a&gt;, Levels will interpret this data alongside information about your meals and exercise to provide AI-generated health guidance. After I downloaded the app and &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/rfk-jr-health-data-wearables-campaign-privacy-concerns.html"&gt;signed over my health data&lt;/a&gt;, my CGM arrived in the mail a few days later.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Each sensor — which lasts about two weeks — comes with an applicator that uses a needle to insert a small wire just under your skin on the back of your upper arm. While this made me a little queasy, putting it on was relatively painless.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmgh0ocui001a3b78enlyzyrl@published" data-word-count="85"&gt;My CGM sent blood-sugar readings to my phone every 15 minutes, and the Levels app quickly got to work generating a complex graph of my fluctuations after each meal and snack. Admittedly, this is fun data to have — at least at first. The feeling that Casey Means was judging everything I put into my body motivated me to be on “good” behavior, avoiding sweets and eating chicken breast whenever I could. But it didn’t take long for the app to start getting on my nerves.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmgh0ocvt001b3b78lry8g21o@published" data-word-count="160"&gt;In the first few days of wearing a CGM, I lost track of how many times the Levels app informed me that my blood sugar was spiking. For people without diabetes, it’s considered normal for blood sugar to be anywhere between 70 and 140 mg/dL, says &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/danielleshine.dietitian/?hl=en"&gt;Danielle Shine&lt;/a&gt;, an accredited dietitian who researches nutrition misinformation at the University of Canberra. However, Levels apparently thinks that’s too lax. The app was concerned pretty much &lt;a href="https://support.levels.com/article/32-about-glucose-response"&gt;anytime my blood sugar was above 110 mg/dL&lt;/a&gt;, and it constantly sent me alarming messages about it. “Did something happen at 3:34 p.m.?” the app wanted to know after I ate a cookie. I did not appreciate getting a push notification reminding me that “some movement can help blunt the spike” while I was in the middle of putting my daughter to bed or sitting in a car on the highway — especially given that, most of the time, my blood sugar was still in the normal range.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmgh0ocxq001c3b781dmuikdg@published" data-word-count="115"&gt;To optimize its “insights,” the app also wanted me to log my meals. Levels &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHJEHO9SHnr/?hl=en"&gt;claims to make macro tracking easier&lt;/a&gt; by having you take a picture of your food and then using AI to calculate the nutrition stats. But this feature could use some work. The app thought my morning yogurt with chia seeds, chopped apples, and nuts was “cream cheese with red pepper, bacon bits, and blue cheese,” a meal I’ve never eaten in my life.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Another time, it thought the meal was “imitation crab salad.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It also didn’t seem to care about portion size, logging a slice of pizza and salad as 1,715 calories. (Apparently, it assumed I ate an entire pizza crust.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmgh0od20001d3b78ves0vb4i@published" data-word-count="199"&gt;Then there were the scores. Levels rates each meal on a scale &lt;a href="https://support.levels.com/article/32-about-glucose-response"&gt;from one to ten&lt;/a&gt; based on nutritional quality and glucose response. According to the app, meals with eggs, chicken, avocado, and nuts tend to score higher, while lower-scoring meals include cereal, noodles, and candy. These scores can be brutal. Thai takeout for dinner — chicken curry with rice and drunken noodles — earned me a one. “Big spike,” the app warned, recommending that next time I order out, I should “swap white rice for steamed vegetables.” On the other hand, eating a salad with grilled chicken and avocado for lunch only got a seven. The app also wasn’t that impressed when I ate Greek salad for dinner, suggesting that I “consider limiting higher-carb ingredients like chickpeas” in the future. Still, it was hard to take Levels’ recommendations too seriously, given that the same exact turkey wrap for lunch earned a nine (excellent) one day and a five (poor) another. After I logged an ice cream sandwich as a treat, the app thought I’d be interested to learn that ice cream is high in sugar, directing me to &lt;a href="https://www.levels.com/blog/5-low-carb-ice-creams"&gt;a list of low-carb alternatives&lt;/a&gt;. (Surprisingly, Levels said this post wasn’t sponsored.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmgh0od3z001e3b78gao6e694@published" data-word-count="125"&gt;As much as the Levels app annoyed me, the constant alerts that my blood sugar was out of whack did stress me out. After a bowl of popcorn resulted in a “big spike,” I began to wonder if my cravings for “&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DK2VhRYoGFE/?hl=en"&gt;naked carbs&lt;/a&gt;” — Glucose Goddess’s term for when you eat starch or sugar without pairing it with protein and fat — were slowly killing me. But the dietitians I spoke with said that, for people without diabetes, obsessing over blood-sugar readings usually isn’t helpful. “It’s information overload,” says Shine. For nondiabetics, it’s normal for glucose to rise after a meal, and it typically returns to baseline within an hour or two. “That’s a healthy metabolic response.” (Levels did not respond to a request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmgh0od56001f3b78hfo42yop@published" data-word-count="107"&gt;According to Shine, what Levels deems a “spike” is often just a normal fluctuation. In fact, she says the term “blood sugar spike” is rarely used in a clinical setting at all. (It’s worth noting that the American Diabetes Association doesn’t set post-meal glucose targets for people without diabetes, since it’s not recommended they routinely monitor their blood sugar.) While it’s true that meals that are heavy in refined carbs can make glucose levels rise higher and faster, Shine says that occasional readings above 140mg/dL usually aren’t cause for concern. “As a dietitian, I look at the bigger picture and the person’s overall dietary pattern,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmgh0od8c001h3b78b5d45czg@published" data-word-count="137"&gt;The influencers pushing CGMs argue that every blood-sugar “spike” is dangerous. Mark Hyman, a&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;functional-medicine doctor and &lt;a href="https://www.levels.com/levels-advisors/mark-hyman-md"&gt;adviser to Levels&lt;/a&gt;, claims that frequent spikes &lt;a href="https://drhyman.com/pages/levels"&gt;lead to insulin resistance&lt;/a&gt; and type 2 diabetes, and says that even sweet potatoes may need to be approached with caution. Glucose Goddess’s feed is full of &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKkVkGIIaT0/?hl=en"&gt;warnings&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmTIv8te7H0"&gt;having oatmeal for breakfast&lt;/a&gt; is a recipe for feeling tired and hungry all day. She claims the order in which you eat your food matters, and that you should have &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNBQHTGoUAu/?hl=en"&gt;vegetables first&lt;/a&gt; to lower the spike. (She &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMLLhrfoUkJ/?hl=en"&gt;suggests&lt;/a&gt; that bread at restaurants is a conspiracy so that you’ll feel hungrier after your main course and order dessert.) Ideally, you’d go for a walk after every meal, but if you can’t manage that, she recommends you &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNyAB1pxFyB/?hl=en"&gt;do some calf raises&lt;/a&gt; to “soak up the glucose.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmgh0od9u001i3b78471cu1np@published" data-word-count="138"&gt;It’s hard to argue with the fact that pairing carbs with protein, fat, and fiber will keep you full longer — and keep your energy and mood stable, says &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/langernutrition/"&gt;Abby Langer&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian. “Dietitians have been telling people to do that for years.” Going for a walk after eating is generally a good idea, too. But if you don’t have diabetes, you don’t need to manipulate your meals to avoid every possible “spike,” Langer says. Inspired by Glucose Goddess’s “hacks,” Shine says she’s had a number of clients who insist on eating chicken or an egg before having a cookie. “I always ask, &lt;em&gt;Do you enjoy that?&lt;/em&gt; I have yet to hear anyone say yes.” While eating vegetables or protein first might result in slightly lower blood sugar, “for the average person, there’s no clinical relevance whatsoever,” says Langer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmgh0odc3001j3b78kniu17ly@published" data-word-count="141"&gt;It’s true that, in the long term, a diet that’s high in refined carbs, added sugar, and saturated fat can increase your risk of developing insulin resistance. But there’s no evidence that temporary “spikes” after carb-heavy meals cause insulin resistance in metabolically healthy people — or that keeping blood-glucose levels below 110mg/dL, as Levels recommends, improves long-term health outcomes, says Shine. That said, if your blood sugar is consistently above the normal range, that can signal impaired glucose tolerance — which should be assessed by a doctor, not the Levels app. CGMs aren’t approved for diagnosing prediabetes or diabetes, which requires &lt;a href="https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/48/Supplement_1/S27/157566/2-Diagnosis-and-Classification-of-Diabetes"&gt;validated lab tests conducted under medical supervision&lt;/a&gt;. And diet alone doesn’t determine your risk for developing diabetes, which has many contributing factors, including genetics, low physical activity, chronic poor sleep, chronic stress, smoking, long-term alcohol consumption, and excess body fat, says Shine.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmgh0oddu001k3b78brmlylkd@published" data-word-count="127"&gt;Using Levels, it’s easy to get the impression that you should aim to keep your blood sugar as low as possible — but that really isn’t good for you. “I think CGMs should come with a warning label,” says Shine, who had one client who became so fixated on keeping her glucose levels down that she had to be hospitalized after fainting. (The same client also drank apple cider vinegar before meals — one of Glucose Goddess’s &lt;a href="https://www.glucosegoddess.com/pages/vinegar-guide?srsltid=AfmBOoqQtRVn-uLSSMBjDXfkX2RXqvk3yjPaPxAY8xvmOkEZsJMeWkeA"&gt;signature “hacks”&lt;/a&gt; to keep blood sugar down — which eroded the enamel on her teeth, Shine says.) “I think it can be profoundly damaging to our relationship with food and our bodies to drill everything down to numbers,” says Langer. “It creates this total disconnect between how we feel and what we want.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmgh0odf9001l3b78s107e8nk@published" data-word-count="68"&gt;By the end of two weeks, I was itching to rip my CGM off my arm and scrub away the grimy-looking residue from the adhesive. It was a joy to have a bowl of pasta without getting a scorecard afterwards — and I certainly don’t plan to keep paying $24 a month to have every snack judged by an app that can’t tell the difference between apples and bacon.&lt;/p&gt;

Participants were then grouped into three sleep patterns: healthy (≥ 4 points), intermediate (2-3 points) or poor (≤ 1 point).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An average of 8.9 years after baseline assessment, participants underwent brain MRI. The researchers estimated brain age using a machine learning model based on 1079 MRI scan markers, including the number of lesions in specific brain regions or the microstructure of different white matter tracts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, 285 of these markers influenced the brain age estimate most strongly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In simple terms, these features on a brain MRI scan are the strongest indicators that make the brain appear ‘older,’” Dove told &lt;em&gt;Medscape Medical News&lt;/em&gt; in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation was measured using mediation analysis and the INFLA score, which is based on blood inflammatory biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used linear regression and generalized structural equation models to analyze the data and adjusted for age, sex, education level, race, socioeconomic status, lifestyle, and cardiometabolic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Role of Inflammation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At baseline, 55.6% of participants had an intermediate sleep pattern, 41.2% had healthy sleep, and 3.3% had poor sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to those with a healthy sleep pattern, participants with intermediate or poor sleep were more likely to be male and older, and to have a higher BMI and lower socioeconomic status. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between a person’s actual age and brain age was significantly higher among those with an intermediate (beta, 0.24 [0.11, 0.38], &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = .010) or poor (beta, 0.50 [0.12, 0.87], &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; .001) sleep pattern, compared to healthy sleepers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Brain age was on average 0.62 years older than chronological age among people with an intermediate sleep pattern and 0.99 years older among those with a poor sleep pattern,” the investigators wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gap between brain age and the person’s actual age grew 0.48 years with each point decrease in sleep score. Inflammation mediated 6.81% and 10.42% of the associations between intermediate and poor sleep and higher brain age gap, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This underscores that inflammation is a major mechanism connecting sleep to brain aging, although it is not the only factor at play,” Dove said. Other mechanisms could play a role, such as the glymphatic system, commonly dubbed the &lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/while-you-were-sleeping-brains-waste-disposal-system-was-2025a1000mbb"&gt;brain’s waste disposal&lt;/a&gt; system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study limitations included the self-reported nature of sleep quality and the fact that UK Biobank participants tend to be healthier and more socioeconomically advantaged than the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The authors reported no disclosures. The study was funded by Alzheimerfonden, Demensfonden, Loo and Hans Osterman Foundation for Medical Research, the Knowledge Foundation, and the Swedish Research Council.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medscape</author><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2025 14:52:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxNaXJWNmd3VmdWaTlEUlozb0xWaW5hZ2c1cS1oeHFydGFvNmxMSHJjd2x5Ykphak9JckZ4TWRHTlFmS0JuNmQ1WTZIYTRXc3Bmdy1uNmpBR1REMlI2Z2pQRUVUWEdwUTJPRDFLUVpnU1BWQWVzMWJad0tBbDd5QjR5VkMyOTUwRklLY3dDU3Bxd2lGNjA</guid></item></channel></rss>
