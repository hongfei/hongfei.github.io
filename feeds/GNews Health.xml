Taking the drug for one to three years was associated with a 10 percent decline in risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants were from the Veterans Affairs database, and most were over 50 years old, but researchers said their results suggested metformin could potentially be used to help prevent colon cancer for wider groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Uncontrolled diabetes is a risk factor for the disease, so treating it in general may lower cancer risk, but using metformin may provide additional benefits, as previous research has shown the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13337751/metformin-diabetes-anti-aging-trial.html"&gt;drug has been linked to slowed aging and reduced mortality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Popular podcaster Joe Rogan, 57, who hasn't revealed if he is taking the drug himself, often talks about the medication on his podcast, with expert guests touting its potential longevity benefits.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One guest, Harvard anti-aging scientist Dr David Sinclair claimed it could help to slow aging - and in an interview with Dr Sinclair in 2019, Rogan said: 'I got to find a quack that's willing to prescribe me metformin.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A study suggests that metformin, which Joe Rogan has mentioned repeatedly on his popular podcast, could help to reduce the risk of colon cancer on the left side of the colon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Metformin has been approved for type 2 diabetics but is prescribed off label for a range of ailments. Researchers are also looking at whether it could be used to fight aging&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was revealed at ASCO 2025, the world's largest cancer conference taking place this week in Chicago, Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While promising, scientists behind the paper did not provide an explanation as to why the drug may be protective and said their results needed to be confirmed with more research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Metformin is a prescription-only medication approved for type 2 diabetics to help them control blood sugar levels, with patients taking about two pills per day - sometimes priced at as little as 20 cents a pill. It is estimated that over 19 million Americans are prescribed it each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it is also prescribed off-label for a number of other conditions, including prediabetes and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, a condition in which women experience cysts on their ovaries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists from The Jusidman Cancer Center in Israel analyzed data on patients in the Veterans Affairs database from 1999 to 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They recruited patients on metformin and matched them to patients with similar characteristics not on metformin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These tended to be less healthy patients, which raises the risk of a colon cancer diagnosis or comorbidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the metformin group, the majority of patients had used the substance for at least five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, data was available on the location of the tumor for more than 113,000 patients in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of these, 13,691 were in the metformin group - including 9,588 (70 percent) who developed colon cancer on the left side of the colon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Approximately 100,000 people were in the non-metformin group - including 95,000 (95 percent) who developed the cancer on the left side of their colon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Colon cancer is increasingly striking young people. Bailey Hutchins of Tennessee (pictured), died of colon cancer at 26 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers work was published as&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/ABSTRACT483236"&gt; an abstract &lt;/a&gt;by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and has not been made fully available or peer reviewed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, previously published work has found similar benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study from 2019 found metformin was associated with an eight percent reduction in colorectal cancer. By location, it was associated with a 14 percent reduction in the risk of cancer in the rectum. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2024 study looked at the expression of HCT116 cells - those found in colon cancer patients. When these cells grow abnormally, it contributes to tumor progression, but metformin altered the expression of these cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed the medication upregulated genes that may suppress the growth and spread of colorectal cancer cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another 2024 study found metformin use was associated with 'significantly lower' colon cancer risk in both the colon and rectum - about a 30 percent decline in risk.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And an increased protective effect was observed in white people and those with obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers concluded metformin's benefits 'likely generalizes to populations with higher underlying risk.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It has long been valued for nutrients like calcium and vitamin D, yet new data hint at another benefit that involves the intricate community of microbes inside the digestive system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent findings, led by &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/people-search/li-jiao-23845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Li Jiao&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.bcm.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Baylor College of Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, shows that milk consumption is connected with an uptick in several helpful bacteria, while cheese may reduce certain microbes important for a balanced intestinal environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-dairy-helps-the-gut"&gt;How dairy helps the gut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say dairy interacts with the microbiome, which is the mix of microorganisms in the body that help break down nutrients. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/some-types-of-plant-based-milk-are-linked-to-mental-disorders-like-depression/"&gt;Milk&lt;/a&gt; seems to support a broader range of gut microbes, a sign of a more adaptable gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have explored the role of milk in encouraging the growth of bacteria linked to lower inflammation and improved gut barriers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29590046/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; suggest this trend could relate to the carbohydrate content in dairy, but details remain under investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-examining-key-bacteria"&gt;Examining key bacteria&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several dairy-linked microbes stand out. One is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10410495/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Faecalibacterium&lt;/a&gt;, known for producing substances that help maintain gut balance and calm inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9300896/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Akkermansia&lt;/a&gt;, often mentioned for its &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29902436/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to healthy weight and blood sugar control. Investigators say these bacteria can be more abundant in the gut when milk intake rises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheese appears to bring different consequences by reducing Bacteroides, which are common gut residents that may influence colon conditions. It also seems to lower &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1075996404000071" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subdoligranulum&lt;/a&gt;, a genus thought to play a part in metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have noticed that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/immunology-and-microbiology/bifidobacterium" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/a&gt;, regarded as a probiotic, may increase with certain dairy habits too. This possibility has drawn interest among professionals looking for dietary ways to support digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-yogurt-didn-t-reveal"&gt;What yogurt didn’t reveal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although yogurt is often praised for its probiotic potential, this study didn’t find clear links between yogurt intake and gut microbiota changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s likely because participants reported very low yogurt consumption overall, limiting meaningful analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without enough data, researchers couldn’t determine whether yogurt had the same effects on key bacteria like Akkermansia or Faecalibacterium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More diverse and higher yogurt intake in future studies may be needed to explore how fermented dairy compares to milk and cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dairy-intake-and-gut-health"&gt;Dairy intake and gut health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few researchers highlight that milk has more lactose, which might help raise the presence of healthful &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/bacteria-recreate-an-ancient-war-trick-to-defeat-viruses/"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheese, produced through fermentation, contains less lactose but includes other elements that might shape the gut in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietitians remind people that daily dairy recommendations can differ by age, lifestyle, and health status. Individuals who are sensitive to lactose or prone to certain digestive concerns might need to choose their dairy products carefully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some nutrition &lt;a href="https://www.myplate.gov" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; in the United States advise around three cups of dairy daily, although personal needs vary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many folks fall short of this amount, which leaves a door open for considering how milk or cheese might add microbial variety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-future-dietary-guidelines"&gt;Future dietary guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health experts caution that these findings shouldn’t lead to broad assumptions about all dairy products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved a small group of older men, and their average dairy intake was lower than national averages, so the results may not apply to other groups or dietary patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the research adds weight to calls for more personalized dietary advice. Instead of focusing only on dairy quantity, future guidelines might need to emphasize the type of dairy product and its effects on gut &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mysterious-bacteria-found-on-chinese-space-station-has-never-been-seen-before/"&gt;bacteria&lt;/a&gt; balance and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limits-of-small-scale-research"&gt;Limits of small-scale research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included only 34 participants, most of whom were older men. This limited sample size makes it hard to apply the findings to younger people, women, or more diverse populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, the reliance on self-reported food frequency questionnaires introduces some uncertainty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People don’t always remember their food habits accurately, which can affect how well their dairy intake matches up with microbiome changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-dairy-gut-health-and-the-future"&gt;Dairy, gut health, and the future&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies increasingly point to the idea that food choices affect more than just basic nutrition. &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/most-americans-dont-know-the-dangers-of-raw-milk-and-bird-flu/"&gt;Milk&lt;/a&gt; consumption, in particular, is now tied to the presence of microbes that could protect against a variety of gut-related issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dairy consumption may influence host health by modulating the structure and composition of the colonic adherent gut microbiota,” said Dr. Jiao. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broader health connection is an active topic, and future efforts may include trials that examine long-term changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers plan to learn more about how each type of dairy modifies these microorganisms in people of different ages and backgrounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also want to understand the range of nutrients, such as calcium or protein, that might work alongside gut microbes to keep digestion running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/3/567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jun 2025 02:27:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxOVTdrdEZVaGFBS1R6dXNTaXNocXExWDZodkZfUXA4ZzhTclYwUkFtN1JxTHRXRFJ2OFRiTndjLWFzLXJDX01neHhBdUNTaG5rYU9reXlwRkw3N1dzMEYtVzQxWFVGMElDSWR6dFNsQ0k2cDFLZVRQeFJIcmdQV3NYRGROVnFMR0FPdHVhVlBabzBMb2FUYVY1eG45blhDRTk0S2RjaUZXUEwzVFhia21taw</guid></item><item><title>德克萨斯州妇女用受感染的自来水冲洗鼻窦后死亡—以下是如何保护自己的安全-纽约邮报 | Texas woman died after rinsing sinuses with infected tap water — here’s how to keep yourself safe - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxNamM0NENWUDdIQzV5NEpXVlFfVHIwWFpwazY2ekJKNmo1QUN6a2Z3WDU3X2duQUR2VjdUNEtqYXFtRnlZN2VOcGRQbWVrWEtzTU80U3BlZzhFWXJtYTNEZ1JDeTNGOEF4b2UyOV9Sd2x4Umh0cS1BcTM4ckRjV2dXQ2xLLXJQdXRrZS10NE55Qjc2aTVKaEtfT1RRc1FhZlBkYjVpUUdR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;A 71-year-old woman reportedly contracted a brain infection from using tap water — and died from it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether tap water is safe to consume where you live, experts advise against letting it go into your sinuses —  or you risk being exposed to a brain-eating condition, like this unidentified woman.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, if water contains amoeba — single-celled organisms — and it gets into a person’s nose, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/03/01/fl-person-dies-after-catching-brain-eating-amoeba-report/"&gt;it can travel to the brain and cause the fatal infection&lt;/a&gt;, commonly known as “brain-eating amoeba” but the technical term for it is Naegleria fowleri, which is what most likely happened to this woman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the Texas Department of State Health Services claims that the sink water in the area is safe to consume, they believe the woman rinsed her sinuses from an RV’s water system at a campground and was infected by &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/10/13/lake-mead-officials-warn-of-rare-but-deadly-brain-eating-amoeba-found-present-in-hot-springs/"&gt;Naegleria fowleri&lt;/a&gt;, as explained by the &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14773767/woman-Texas-dies-brain-eating-infection-naegleria-fowleri.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The condition — typically found in warm water lakes and rivers — is rare, but it’s deadly — killing almost 97% of people who contract it. &lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/state-map.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The CDC reported&lt;/a&gt; 157 confirmed cases in the nation between 1962 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And reportedly, Texas is one of the few US states that has the largest number of amoeba cases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to Texas, Florida has also fallen victim to this terrifying infection. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2023, a Florida woman contracted the brain-eating infection the same way the Texas woman did — and died from it.&lt;/p&gt;

885px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Experts recommend a few different ways to avoid possibly getting infected with this condition.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The adult patient reportedly performed nasal rinsing daily with unboiled tap water, which is thought to be the source of the infection,” the CDC said in a statement to &lt;a href="https://www.fox4now.com/charlotte-county/is-charlotte-countys-tap-water-safe-following-report-of-amoeba-infection"&gt;Fox 4. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24485-brain-eating-amoeba" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of Naegleria fowleri start to show up about 15 days after a person has been exposed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They can range from a mild fever, headache, nausea and vomiting — to more severe ones like a stiff neck, confusion, lack of attention, loss of balance and seizures. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, once a person has been exposed and severely infected — even with treatment, most will die from it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regardless of where someone lives and the quality of their area’s tap water — to avoid any potential exposure to this serious condition, experts recommend boiling water before rinsing sinuses with it or using distilled water, avoid going underwater in a bathtub or freshwater.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also recommended to supervise children playing with sprinklers, and if you haven’t been home in a few days, let water run for several minutes in sinks or showers to flush out stagnant water. &lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the DOH, health officials found 14 sequenced detections of NB.1.8.1 in Washington state. The earliest detection of the new variant was found April 7 and the most recent case is from May 20. Thirteen of the detections were found from the CDC &lt;a href="%7C36df3a36f9bd45616bed08dda20eb12e%7Cccd8a79b7268413b878971f8b6f4c0df%7C1%7C0%7C638844906938479814%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ==%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=UGAsCZG1hy2fQgX5ajvOjsrfrERSQ3phzKKK%2FBqYPBg=&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" title="https://nam04.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3a%2f%2fcovid.cdc.gov%2fcovid-data-tracker%2f%23traveler-genomic-surveillance&amp;amp;data=05%7c02%7ckgilbert%40king5.com%7c36df3a36f9bd45616bed08dda20eb12e%7cccd8a79b7268413b878971f8b6f4c0df%7c1%7c0%7c638"&gt;Traveler Genomics Program&lt;/a&gt;, which tests samples from the SEA Airport. The other instance was submitted by the U.S. Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the detections were confirmed in Washington state, health officials said in a Monday release they could not determine if the people tested are residents of Washington or if they spent time in the state after the sample was collected.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) considers NB.1.8.1 a variant because it is rising in frequency in regions where it has been detected. The organization said the public health risk posed by the variant is low. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data does not indicate that the variant causes more severe disease than its predecessors, according to the WHO. Health officials believe the current vaccine strains are expected to protect against symptomatic and severe disease for NB.1.8.1.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington DOH urged all eligible residents to stay up-to-date on their COVID-19 vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON — What began as an international journey from Turkey to Mexico turned into a race against time last Friday when a 35-year-old woman suffered a mid-flight medical emergency. Thanks to quick-thinking passengers, a skilled doctor on board, and the coordinated efforts of Houston-area medical teams,  Maricela Hernandez Quezada is alive and on the road to a full recovery.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the flight, Hernandez Quezada began showing signs of distress. A doctor  who was also a passenger on the flight recognized the symptoms of a stroke and sprang into action.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doctor administered oxygen, monitored her condition and alerted the flight crew to the severity of the emergency, according to Memorial Hermann Hospital. The plane diverted for an unscheduled stop at Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"She was found to be weak and paralyzed on the right arm, right leg completely, as well as having trouble with her speech, where she could not comprehend what was being told to her," said Dr. Haris Kamal with Memorial Hermann Northeast. "And in terms of output of speech, she was having a word salad, or the wrong words were coming out jumbled up."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I was kind of in shock because I knew, it was I like I was healthy and I don't smoke. I don't drink. And I thought, ‘Wow, how is this possible,’” Hernandez Quezada said. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paramedics met the aircraft on the tarmac and rushed Hernandez Quezada to Memorial Hermann Northeast Hospital. There, she was stabilized before being flown by Life Flight to Memorial Hermann in The Woodlands, where a team was already preparing for surgery.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the emergency procedure, Hernandez Quezada was paralyzed on her right side and unable to speak. After the successful removal of a life-threatening brain clot, she is now walking, talking, and is expected to make a full recovery.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kamal removed the clot with a catheter inserted in her leg. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I expect her to continue this trajectory of improvement to hopefully being near normal or normal in a few months’ time, where anyone who would be speaking with her would probably not be able to tell that she had literally just been through a major neurological event,” Kamal said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What caused Hernandez Quezada's stroke?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kamal said in this case, the long plane ride with Hernandez Quezada not staying hydrated and not getting up to stretch most likely resulted with a blood clot in her leg that traveled to her brain. She easily could have died.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I feel blessed because all the doctors and nurses that have care of me,” she said. “And I just feel like a new person.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Do you know the signs of a stroke? Familiarize yourself with B.E. F.A.S.T&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signs of a stroke are not that hard to remember, especially if you remember the word "B.E. F.A.S.T."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"B.E. F.A.S.T." is a helpful acronym. It’s the signs of a stroke and knowing them could potentially be lifesaving. It stands for:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

The medication that had formerly cost him less than $70 at his Appleton, Wisconsin pharmacy was now priced at more than $500, according to Cole’s father, Bil Schmidtknecht. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Stunned, Cole left the store with a medication designed to stop asthma attacks once they start, but without the Advair Diskus inhaler he needed to prevent attacks from happening in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Five days after his pharmacy visit last year, Cole had a severe asthma attack, stopped breathing and collapsed. He never regained consciousness and died. Doctors attributed his death to asthma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii styles_portrait__NEQhG" id="anchor-29b476"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/250530-schmidtknecht-family-wm-523p-50001a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250530-schmidtknecht-family-wm-523p-50001a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/250530-schmidtknecht-family-wm-523p-50001a.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250530-schmidtknecht-family-wm-523p-50001a.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250530-schmidtknecht-family-wm-523p-50001a.jpg" alt="Schmidtknecht Family"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Cole Schmidtknecht, left, his mother, Shanon, his brother, Dane, and father, Bil.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Schmidtknecht Family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;His parents, Bil and Shanon Schmidtknecht, blame what they say is a dysfunctional system where medications can change in price overnight and without notice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A part of the insurance system that many Americans don’t know about was responsible for the spike in Cole’s inhaler price. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/house-lawmakers-slam-pharmacy-middlemen-sky-high-drug-prices-rcna163180" target="_blank"&gt;Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs&lt;/a&gt;, are the middlemen that control behind the scenes which drugs will be on an insurance company’s list of covered medications (called its formulary). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;They add or subtract medications through a process that emphasizes profits for the pharmacy benefit manager by way of “rebates” from drug makers, said Gerard Anderson, a professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;PBMs “are looking for the drug that makes them the most money,” Andersen said&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s insane that it’s happening in America,” Bil Schmidknecht said. “It’s not broken. It’s designed to work this way. It’s just hurting us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Schmidtknechts are pushing for legislation that would require a 90-day warning when an insurance company’s formulary is changed. They are also suing Optum Rx, the PBM that took Cole’s Advair Diskus off his insurance company’s formulary, and Walgreens, his pharmacy, which, the Schmidtknechts say, didn’t offer Cole a way to control his asthma while another solution could be found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The lawsuit claims that Cole did not get the required 30 days’ notice of the change, that his doctor wasn’t contacted and that the pharmacy didn’t provide Cole with any more affordable options. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Schmidknechts said Cole left the pharmacy with only a &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000008.htm" target="_blank"&gt;rescue inhaler&lt;/a&gt;, which is used for quick relief. But that type of medication by itself isn’t strong enough to keep someone out of the emergency room if the asthma attack is severe, Dr. David Bernstein, an immunologist who is a professor in the division of immunology, allergy and rheumatology at the University of Cincinnati, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It was empty at his house, next to his bed,” Bil said of the emergency inhaler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In a motion to dismiss the Schmidkneckt’s lawsuit, Optum Rx expressed “its deepest sympathies” for Cole’s death and said federal law prohibits the case from being brought in state court. Optum also said three alternatives, each with a $5 copay, were available, and its system instructed Walgreens to contact Cole’s doctor about those options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Walgreens also offered “its deepest sympathies and cited privacy for why it can’t discuss specifics in the case. In a statement, it added, “In general, in cases where a medication is not covered by insurance, pharmacy staff may work with the plan, patient, and/or prescriber in an effort to process and dispense the prescription if able.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Cole would be 24 now. When speaking about all the things he could have been doing, his parents nearly break down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“He was just so young, and he had his whole life ahead of him,” Shanon said. “And it was so preventable and so unnecessary.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For the Schmidkneckts, it's about policy change. “Justice for Cole, of course, but bigger than that, justice for us all,” Shanon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Getting that change won’t be easy.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In the U.S., just three PBMs process 80% of prescriptions. And a big part of the PBM formulary playbook is secrecy, Anderson said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii" id="anchor-8dfd42"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/250530-schmidtknecht-family-wm-524p-b84842.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250530-schmidtknecht-family-wm-524p-b84842.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-05/250530-schmidtknecht-family-wm-524p-b84842.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250530-schmidtknecht-family-wm-524p-b84842.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250530-schmidtknecht-family-wm-524p-b84842.jpg" alt="Cole Schmidtknecht"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;Cole Schmidtknecht.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Courtesy Schmidtknecht Family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;That way, patients don’t learn how PBMs make their decisions about drugs and why a medication that had been on the formulary no longer is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Often no one, from the patients to the drug companies to the insurers, is aware of the details of the decisions the PBMs are making. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“They do not share this information widely, as it is considered a trade secret,” Anderson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The deals are “a negotiation between the drug companies and the PBM,” Anderson said. “The drug company wants their drug on the formulary in a favorable position. The PBM wants to get the largest possible rebate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The “rebate” is the difference between the list price for a drug and what the PBM can buy it for, which can be “a very much lower number than the list price,” Anderson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When there are multiple drugs that do essentially the same thing, then there’s a bidding war, usually a silent one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The rewards for the PBMs can be huge. A &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/ftc-releases-second-interim-staff-report-prescription-drug-middlemen" target="_blank"&gt;Federal Trade Commission report&lt;/a&gt; released in January found that, over the past few years, the three biggest PBMs — CVS Health Caremark Rx, Cigna’s Express Scripts and UnitedHealth Group’s Optum Rx — inflated the costs of numerous life-saving medications by billions of dollars. The companies countered that the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/top-three-insurers-reaped-73-billion-drug-middlemens-markups-ftc-says-rcna187640" target="_blank"&gt;FTC report’s conclusions were misleading.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In January, CVS Health said in a statement that it “is inappropriate and misleading to draw broad conclusions from cherry-picked ‘specialty generic’ outliers” and that the company’s “top priority is to make health care more affordable.” OptumRx said that it helped eligible patients save $1.3 billion last year and estimated that the median out-of-pocket payment for these patients was $5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;To remember Cole, both his parents had a tattoo just like his inked onto their wrists. When they feel overwhelmed they glance down at it to remember the change they want to make in his honor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s just everyone’s little reminder, you know, from Cole to just keep living and that we can still be happy,” Shanon said. “I keep trying to remind myself that happiness and joy and grief can co-exist.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We're reporting in depth on the systems surrounding our health care and insurance industries.

&lt;h2&gt;“Quite impressive”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exercise group, which had supervised exercise for the first six months of the three-year intervention, reported more exercise over the study. At the end, the exercise group was averaging over 20 MET hours per week, while the education group's average was around 15 MET hours per week. The exercise group also scored better at cardiorespiratory fitness and physical functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, with the health education, the control group also saw a boost to their exercise during the trial, with their average starting around 10 MET hours per week. These findings "raise the possibility of an even more powerful effect of exercise on cancer outcomes as compared with a completely sedentary control group," the researchers note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, it's not entirely clear how exercise keeps cancers at bay, but it squares with numerous other observational studies that have linked exercise to better outcomes in cancer patients. Researchers have several hypotheses, including that exercise might cause "increased fluid shear stress, enhanced immune surveillance, reduced inflammation, improved insulin sensitivity, and altered microenvironment of major sites of metastases," the authors note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, exercise seemed to keep local and distant colon cancer from recurring, as well as prevent new cancers, including breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside experts hailed the study's findings. "This indicates that exercise has a similarly strong effect as previously shown for chemotherapy, which is really quite impressive," Marco Gerlinger, a gastrointestinal cancer expert at Queen Mary University of London, said in a statement. "One of the commonest questions from patients is what they can do to reduce the risk that their cancer comes back. Oncologists can now make a very clear evidence-based recommendation."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Having worked in bowel cancer research for 30 years, this is an exciting breakthrough in the step-wise improvement in cure rates," David Sebag-Montefiore, a clinical oncologist at the University of Leeds, said. "The great appeal of a structured moderate intensity exercise is that it offers the benefits without the downside of the well-known side effects of our other treatments."&lt;/p&gt;

Those who had consumed most carbohydrates of the highest nutritional quality — including whole grains, fruits, vegetables and legumes — were up to 37 per cent more likely to age healthily than those who reported consuming the lowest intakes of wholesome carbs. Predictably, higher intakes of ultra-processed and refined carbs had a negative effect, resulting in 13 per cent worse odds of healthy ageing. “Refined carbohydrates, which included carbohydrates from added sugars, refined grains, and [white] potatoes, were unfavourably associated with healthy ageing,” Ardisson Korat says. “Minimising the intake of those carbohydrates is related to better healthy ageing outcomes.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Carbohydrates have unfairly taken a bashing, but this new study reinforces that high-quality carbohydrates are essential for gut health and healthy ageing,” says the dietician Bahee Van de Bor, a spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association. “They provide a valuable source of both soluble and insoluble fibre, as well as key vitamins and minerals that support digestion, metabolic health, immune function and beyond.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Eli Brecher, a registered nutritionist, says that carbs should ideally be combined with a source of protein and healthy fats in order to create a balanced meal that supports stable blood sugar and keeps you feeling full. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;So which carbs should we be eating more of? We all know the benefits of wholegrain carbs and that boosting our intakes of foods such as porridge, rye bread and brown rice is a good move. But here are 13 carbs you might want to consider eating more of, according to the experts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3.6"&gt;&lt;div id="e167ea5e-1cd6-412e-9345-ee38635b0a01"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Pears lower your risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;1. Pears&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Studies have linked pear consumption to a reduced risk of heart disease and, thanks to the high levels of beneficial phenolic compounds found particularly in the skin of the fruit, to a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. Pears are also one of the foods rich in flavonoids that have been associated with a healthy gut microbiome and as having a positive effect on blood pressure levels in studies by Aedín Cassidy, professor in nutrition and preventive medicine at Queen’s University in Belfast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;2. Pasta&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Researchers at the University of Minnesota who reviewed 38 published studies on pasta intake for a paper in the journal Nutrients confirmed that even white pasta “does not hinder weight loss or contribute to weight gain”. According to the authors, pasta is made in a way that causes the carbohydrates to digest slowly in the body when cooked, giving a much lower glycaemic response than, say, white bread. Cooling cooked pasta first also produces a lower blood sugar spike. “For added fibre, pasta made from wholewheat or legume flours such as red lentil pasta are good options,” Brecher says. “Pasta offers sustained energy with a low glycaemic impact to keep you going.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3.11"&gt;&lt;div id="f1d465aa-6b09-4057-835f-1515a02cfdbd"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Red rice is a provider of protein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;3. Red rice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;A nutritional analysis of red rice, sold in many supermarkets, in the journal Molecules last year revealed it has an 87.2 per cent carbohydrate content, provides some protein and also contains the beneficial plant compounds flavan-3-ols “which may provide biological benefits to human health”, according to the researchers. “Red rice is a deep red whole grain, its colour indicating it is packed with a unique spectrum of antioxidants and more so than regular brown rice,” says Dr Linia Patel, a researcher in the department of clinical sciences and community health at the Università degli Studi di Milano in Italy, and a spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;4. Raspberries&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Raspberries are an overlooked berry and yet, high in fibre and polyphenols, they can “help to reduce inflammation and support a healthy gut”, Brecher says. In one study, 59 overweight participants with belly fat obesity were asked to either consume 280g a day of frozen raspberries or to stick to their usual diet for two months. Results showed the raspberry-rich diet to have positive effects on immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;5. Red kidney beans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“These are one of my favourite carb sources as great in salads and in place of meat in sauces,” Brecher says. “They are packed with plant-based protein, iron and resistant starch that feeds our gut bacteria.” Darker-coloured beans such as red kidney beans and also black beans might help to maintain blood vessel health too. Researchers from the University of Manitoba in Canada showed that blood pressure was lower two hours after eating red kidney beans compared with rice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/sugar-consumption-healthy-advice-analysis-foods-q95nrjqq2" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How much sugar are you really eating?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;6. Lentils&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Patel says that fibre-packed pulses and legumes should be a carb staple in our diets and that lentils, with a good iron content, are “also the protein powerhouse of the legume family”. For a study she published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Patel showed that eating just one 40g portion of dried pulses or legumes (about three tablespoons when cooked) per week decreases the risk of colon cancer by 21 per cent compared with those who ate none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;7. Kiwi fruit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Two kiwis are packed with 5g of fibre, which is 16 per cent of your recommended daily amount,” Patel says. The green flesh of the furry-skinned fruit contains tiny amounts of the hormone melatonin, which plays a role in circadian rhythm regulation and scientists have shown that eating a couple before bed might improve sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;8. Figs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Sweet from naturally occurring sugar and rich in calcium, potassium and prebiotic fibre, figs help to nourish gut bacteria,” Brecher says. “As a source of vitamin K1, they also help to support bone health.” Figs are packed with a plant hormone called abscisic acid, which helps to manage the body’s blood glucose response. A study in Diabetes journal showed that 100-200mg of fig extract lowered blood sugar within 30-120 minutes. And eating more fresh or dried figs might help to reduce blood sugar levels by up to 13.5 per cent in eight weeks, according to a review by food scientists at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/how-to-have-a-healthy-brain-dxpg2mbtb" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nine ways to keep your brain healthy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;9. Broccoli&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;About seven per cent of the total weight of broccoli is carbs and it is a great standby, Van de Bor says. As a member of the cruciferous vegetable family, she says it also contains powerful compounds called glucosinolates that are broken down to form biologically active compounds that are known to have health benefits such as preventing damaging oxidative stress in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;10. Quinoa &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“Quinoa provides fibre, iron, B vitamins and good amounts of protein as well as valuable carbohydrates,” Brecher says. “Technically a seed, quinoa is a complete plant protein and is naturally gluten-free, so a good option for those avoiding common grains like wheat, barley and spelt.” In a 2024 review in Frontiers in Nutrition journal, researchers from China reported that quinoa is also rich in active ingredients such as flavonoids, saponins, peptides and polysaccharides, which may help to regulate blood sugar, lower cholesterol levels and also have an anti-inflammatory effect on the body, all of which are helpful in the prevention of heart disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="3.32"&gt;&lt;div id="c08f9367-cd58-470c-9e67-3f10ea1ce4fd"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__PrimaryImg-sc-4v1r4q-3 hpWIYt"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__InsetCaptionStyle-sc-1io40fc-2 fkMBIX"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Red cabbage can reduce your risk of cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;11. Red cabbage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“This is a tremendous carb-loaded vegetable as it keeps for ever in the fridge, ready to supercharge any salad,” Patel says. “It is loaded with anthocyanins — the “daddy” of polyphenols — which give it its purple colour.” The US Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service identified 36 anthocyanins in red cabbage, which have been shown in some studies to provide cancer protection, improve brain function and promote heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;12.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Texas is among the states that have suffered the largest burden of brain-eating amoeba cases, with 39 of around 160 recorded in the US all-time in the Lone Star state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The amoeba causes a disease called primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, also known as PAM or amebic meningitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It thrives in warm water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Initial symptoms include a headache, vomiting and nausea. A person can then suffer cognitive issues and a stuff neck as things progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It causes severe swelling, and eventually rotting, of the brain and spinal cord. This will almost always eventually lead to death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are no known effective treatments for PAM. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the recent Texas case, the woman developed severe neurologic symptoms, including fever, headache, and altered mental status within four days of using a nasal irrigation device filled with the compromised tap water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite medical treatment, the patient developed seizures and subsequently died eight days after symptom onset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Laboratory testing at CDC confirmed the presence of N. fowleri in the patient's brain and spinal fluid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sinus rinsing is a practice where a person flows water into their nose through one nostril and out the other - in an attempt to clean mucus and other debris. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Local officials advise residents to boil water for at least one minute before using it to wash their noses to kill any lingering bacteria or harmful chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also say not to allow water into your nose when showering, bathing, swimming, or in a blow-up pool, not to put your head underwater in the tub, to avoid letting children play with sprinklers while unsupervised and the avoid slip-and-slides. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is not the first recent case potentially tied to water systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; In 2020, a six-year-old boy in Lake Jackson, Texas &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-9894927/Seven-year-old-boy-dies-contracting-rare-brain-eating-parasite-California-lake.html"&gt;died from Naegleria fowleri.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials believe he was either infected while playing in a local splash pad or from a water hose at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in 2023, a man in Charlotte County, Florida, &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-11808615/Florida-man-dies-brain-eating-infection-rinsing-nose-TAP-WATER.html"&gt;died after nasal rinsing with tap water.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The amoeba, which is 1,200 times smaller than a dime, enters the body through the olfactory nerve which connects the upper nose to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This gives it a short and direct route into the brain. If water containing the amoeba enters the nose, it will likely lead to infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ingesting water through the mouth is ok because stomach acid is strong enough to kill the amoeba. The nose is its only route.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once a person's olfactory nerve is exposed, it can take around one to nine days to start experiencing symptoms. They will usually die within five days of symptoms first appearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's quite rapid, it's very progressive. It literally eats the brain tissue,' Dr. Anjan Debnath, a parasitologist at the University of California San Diego, explained. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of the rare infection, doctors also often misdiagnose symptoms as meningitis - wasting valuable time that could be used to treat the parasite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Caleb Ziegelbauer (pictured), 13, may become the fifth ever American to survive an infection from brain eating amoeba&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He describes the infection as taking part in two stages. The first is relatively minor, with the person experiencing a headache and other flu-like symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This means that unless a doctor knows that a person has been swimming in untreated water they may not even suspect the amoeba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once symptoms reach the second stage, a person will start experiencing severe neurological issues like seizures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A doctor will then likely find out about the infection through a spinal fluid test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;America suffers around three cases of the amoeba each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They will almost always occur over summer, when many families flock to local lakes and ponds for a daytime outing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Debnath still advises against swimming in untreated water over summer, especially in places like Florida and Texas where temperatures get exceptionally high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because the amoeba only resides in fresh water, swimming in the ocean is generally safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If families do choose to visit a freshwater beach, anyone entering the water should wear a nose clip to prevent water from entering their nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Debnath also recommends against kicking up dirt or sand from the bottom of the lake as warmer areas deep down are where the microscopic beings usually lie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 20:44:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>阻断脑炎症分子可能阻止阿尔茨海默氏症-神经科学新闻 | Blocking Brain Inflammation Molecule May Halt Alzheimer’s - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTFAzeWpOLUdRb2VUX2ZsVDZfTW1qRGhIZm5yc3VlOUFhM3FnVWY2RDBNSVVPNUM2WnRFZnhrVDluVDJhWWJLSkVxZ3ZfdnZQaGl0bXkyZFMzU1RvekRTOTM1NDVod2t2UWhZYUVmd0Zfa3p2SGFf?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study has uncovered a surprising culprit in the progression of Alzheimer’s disease: the immune molecule STING. Scientists found that STING, normally involved in defending the brain, becomes hyperactive with age, causing harmful inflammation and accelerating brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mouse models, blocking STING prevented the buildup of plaques and tangles and protected cognitive function. This breakthrough points to STING as a promising therapeutic target not just for Alzheimer’s, but also for other neurodegenerative diseases like ALS and Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STING Activation:&lt;/strong&gt; DNA damage during aging triggers STING, leading to harmful brain inflammation and neuronal injury.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Target:&lt;/strong&gt; Blocking STING in mice reduced plaque formation, protected neurons, and improved memory.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Relevance:&lt;/strong&gt; STING may also play roles in Parkinson’s, ALS, and dementia, offering a new treatment pathway.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Virginia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new way of thinking about Alzheimer’s disease has yielded a discovery that could be the key to stopping the cognitive decline seen in Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of Virginia School of Medicine scientists have been investigating the possibility that Alzheimer’s is caused, at least in part, by the immune system’s wayward attempts to fix DNA damage in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110580"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/sting-inflammation-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The causes of Alzheimer’s remain murky, but scientists are increasingly coming to appreciate the role of the immune system in the disease’s development. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their research reveals that an immune molecule called STING drives the formation of the harmful plaques and protein tangles thought responsible for Alzheimer’s. Blocking the molecule protected lab mice from mental decline, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An important player in the brain’s immune system, STING also may be a key contributor to Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig’s disease), dementia and other memory-robbing conditions. That means that developing treatments to control its activity could have far-reaching benefits for many patients facing now-devastating diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings demonstrate that the DNA damage that naturally accumulates during aging triggers STING-mediated brain inflammation and neuronal damage in Alzheimer’s disease,” said researcher John Lukens, PhD, director of UVA’s Harrison Family Translational Research Center in Alzheimer’s and Neurodegenerative Diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These results help to explain why aging is associated with increased Alzheimer’s risk and uncover a novel pathway to target in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alarming Trends in Alzheimer’s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s is a growing problem across the country and around the world: More than 7 million Americans are already living with the condition, and that number could top 13 million by 2050. That has researchers working frantically to find ways to better understand and treat the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The causes of Alzheimer’s remain murky, but scientists are increasingly coming to appreciate the role of the immune system in the disease’s development. STING is part of that immune response; the molecule helps direct the clearance of viruses and stressed cells harboring DNA damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While STING is an important defender of the brain, it can also become hyperactive and cause harmful inflammation and tissue damage. That had Lukens and his team eager to determine what part it could be playing in Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blocking the molecule’s activity in lab mice, they found, helped prevent Alzheimer’s plaque formation, altered the activity of immune cells called microglia and redirected the workings of important genes, among other effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that removing STING dampened microglial activation around amyloid plaques, protected nearby neurons from damage and improved memory function in Alzheimer’s model mice,” said researcher Jessica Thanos, part of UVA’s Department of Neuroscience and Center for Brain Immunology and Glia (BIG Center).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Together, these findings suggest that STING drives detrimental immune responses in the brain that exacerbate neuronal damage and contribute to cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promising Treatment Target&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While scientists have been investigating other molecules thought to be important in Alzheimer’s, STING makes for a particularly attractive target for developing new treatments, the UVA Health researchers say. That’s because blocking STING appears to slow both the buildup of amyloid plaques and the development of tau tangles, the two leading candidates for the cause of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other molecules lack that robust involvement, and, further, could be targeted only at very specific – and very limited – stages in the disease’s progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are only beginning to understand the complex role of innate immune activation in the brain, and this is especially true in both normal and pathological aging,” Thanos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we can pinpoint which cells and signals sustain that activation, we will be in a much better position to intervene effectively in disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Lukens’ pioneering research has opened new doors in the fight against Alzheimer’s, much more work will need to be done to translate the findings into treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, scientists will need to better understand STING’s roles in the body – such as in the immune system’s response to cancer – to ensure any new treatment doesn’t cause unwanted side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But those are the types of big questions that Lukens and his collaborators at the Harrison Family Translational Research Center are eager to tackle as part of their efforts to fast-track new treatments and, eventually, they hope, cures. (The center is part of UVA’s Paul and Diane Manning Institute of Biotechnology, now under construction at Fontaine Research Park.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our hope is that this work moves us close to finding safer and more effective ways to protect the aging brain, as there is an urgent need for treatments that can slow or prevent neuronal damage in Alzheimer’s,” Lukens said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Shedding light on how STING contributes to that damage may help us target similar molecules and ultimately develop effective disease-modifying treatments.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Findings Published&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers have published their findings in &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer’s Association&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team consisted of Thanos, Olivia C.

But the less-discussed part on “overmedicalization” of American children stood out to us. While the report mentions surgical care only briefly, it identifies two common procedures, adenotonsillectomy and tympanostomy tube (ear tube) placement, as surgeries that “cause harm without offering benefits.” These procedures are among the most performed surgeries in children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are pediatric ear, nose, and throat surgeons with years of clinical and research experience. One of us (EB) leads research on how parents make decisions about elective surgeries like tonsillectomy. The other (DT) has led development of national evidence-based clinical practice guidelines aimed to ensure appropriate surgical care. We agree that these two childhood procedures are performed often enough to warrant vigilance around overuse and unnecessary surgery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the MAHA report presents its conclusions on surgery with tunnel vision and misinterpretation. It did not recognize proven benefits of surgery: for tonsil and adenoid removal, improved sleep, behavior, and learning; for ear tube placement, better hearing, speech, and fewer infections. In appropriately selected children, these surgeries improve quality of life and reduce both health care visits and use of antibiotics. A blanket dismissal of surgical benefits could threaten access to necessary care for children with sleep apnea or hearing loss. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The appropriate indications and expected health benefits of adenotonsillectomy and ear tube surgery for young children have been debated for decades. In 2009, President Obama &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/22/us/politics/22obama.transcript.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that financial factors might influence a surgeon’s decision to recommend tonsillectomy. In 2012, a National Summit on Overuse highlighted &lt;a href="https://www.parsemus.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/AMA-National_Summit_Overuse.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;misuse of ear tubes for short-term ear fluid&lt;/a&gt;. Events like these spurred the development of evidence-based practice guidelines informed by clinical trials, experience, and patient outcomes. These guidelines &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30798778/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;clearly delineate surgical indications&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://aao-hnsfjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1177/01945998211065662" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;emphasize shared decision-making&lt;/a&gt; between families and surgeons. Though still common, these surgeries have decreased in frequency over time. Meanwhile, indications have evolved and become more precise. Tonsillectomy, once used for recurrent throat infections, is now most often performed to treat obstructed breathing and sleep apnea. Ear tubes are now used to treat persistent middle ear fluid causing hearing loss and speech delay rather than infrequent, uncomplicated ear infections.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;There are real, proven, and often life-changing benefits of adenotonsillectomy and ear tube surgery for many children. Performed on &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28256998/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;nearly 300,000 U.S. children each year&lt;/a&gt;, adenotonsillectomy is used to treat children with obstructive sleep apnea, a common condition that can lead to heart and lung strain, fatigue, hyperactivity, inattention, bedwetting, and learning delays.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MAHA report states there is no benefit of adenotonsillectomy for sleep apnea, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31919049/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;citing a single study&lt;/a&gt; that found no difference in a generic IQ screening measure. However, that same study also reported significant improvements in sleep apnea severity, behavior, and physical health in children who underwent surgery — findings that were not acknowledged in the MAHA report. More concerning, the report failed to reference many additional well-designed studies that show consistent improvements in health, sleep, behavior, learning, and quality of life after surgery. Large-scale randomized &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23692173/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;trials&lt;/a&gt; confirm that while some children with sleep apnea may improve without treatment, the majority continue to experience symptoms that are alleviated with surgery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ear tube surgery tells a similar story. Yes, overuse has occurred, especially for children with recurrent infections or transient middle ear fluid. Contemporary guidelines advise against surgery in such cases. But for children with persistent fluid and hearing loss, ear tubes provide measurable improvement. Judicious use of ear tubes also helps reduce repeated antibiotic use, a key overtreatment concern highlighted in the MAHA report. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How can we move forward, guarding against overuse while continuing to offer surgery to children who will benefit? We must better understand the real-world complexity of children undergoing surgery. Research should expand to include data beyond clinical trials and fragmented outcome measure assessment. We must also promote best practices that reduce risk and recognize that two children with the same diagnosis may have different symptom burdens, family priorities, and definitions of successful treatment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Surgery for children should always be under scrutiny. We strive to offer surgery only when expected outcomes are favorable, risks are minimal, and disease burden justifies intervention. We applaud MAHA policymakers who focus on overuse, but we urge a comprehensive review of trials, systematic reviews, and practice guidelines. Tonsillectomy and ear tube surgery benefit many children. We know this not only from a more thorough analysis than MAHA provided, but also from clinical experience treating thousands of children. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If evidence and our experience are not enough, ask the parents. They will tell you about children who sleep soundly, hear clearly, speak precisely, perform better in school, and were changed for the better by surgery that was carefully considered and prudently delivered.&lt;/p&gt;

Typically, flies avoid the drug due to its bitter taste, but by disabling their bitter-sensing receptors, scientists encouraged addictive behavior within just 16 hours of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This model is a major step toward rapidly testing the genetic and neurological mechanisms behind cocaine use disorder. Because flies share many addiction-related genes with humans, this research could greatly accelerate the discovery of effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fly Addiction Model:&lt;/strong&gt; Genetically altered fruit flies will now self-administer cocaine, mimicking addictive behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taste Receptor Blockade:&lt;/strong&gt; Disabling bitter taste receptors enabled flies to prefer cocaine-laced sugar water.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Acceleration:&lt;/strong&gt; This model allows fast screening of addiction-related genes to inform treatment targets.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Utah&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the first time, researchers have created genetically modified fruit flies that can become addicted to cocaine. The flies will self-administer cocaine if given the option. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new model could prove immensely valuable for the development of new therapies to prevent and treat cocaine use disorder, a growing and deadly concern that affects about 1.5 million people nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110576"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/genetics-cocaine-addiction-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The dosage was important—flies would only voluntarily consume cocaine at low concentrations—but they developed a preference remarkably quickly, within 16 hours of first exposure. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heredity strongly impacts the risk of developing cocaine use disorder, but the large number of genes implicated in addiction risk has made it difficult to determine which might be the best targets for therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With their new fruit fly model of cocaine use disorder, the researchers hope to reveal the biology of addiction and find better therapies much faster than was previously possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new results are published in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-flying aspirations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flies and humans react to cocaine in remarkably similar ways, says Adrian Rothenfluh, PhD, associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Utah and the senior author on the study. “At low doses, they start running around, just like people,” Rothenfluh says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At very high doses, they get incapacitated, which is also true in people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flies and humans have a lot in common when it comes to addiction. Flies have about 75% of the human genes that are known to be involved in disease, and the insects have been instrumental in discovering the underlying biology behind other substance dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because fruit flies grow quickly and are easy to conduct genetic experiments with, a fruit fly model of cocaine use disorder would be a valuable early step toward developing therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is just one problem—one very significant difference between flies and humans—Rothenfluh says: “Flies do not like cocaine one bit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His research team found that when given a choice between sugar water and sugar water laced with cocaine, fruit flies consistently chose the drug-free option, even when they’d been exposed to cocaine previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand addiction in humans, the scientists needed to figure out why flies wouldn’t take cocaine—and if there was a way to bypass that barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bitter truth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travis Philyaw, PhD, first author on the paper, suspected that the answer might lie in the flies’ sense of taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Insects are evolutionarily primed to avoid plant toxins, and cocaine is a plant toxin,” says Philyaw, now a research scientist at University of Washington, who did the research as a graduate student in Rothenfluh’s lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They have taste receptors on their ‘arms’—their tarsal segments—so they can put their hand in something before it goes in their mouth, and decide, ‘I’m not going to touch that.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By watching how flies’ sensory nerves responded to cocaine, the researchers found that the compound strongly activates bitter-sensing taste receptors in the flies’ tarsal segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers muted the activity of those bitter-sensing nerves so that the flies couldn’t taste bitter flavors, they did start developing a preference for cocaine-laced sugar water over plain sugar water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dosage was important—flies would only voluntarily consume cocaine at low concentrations—but they developed a preference remarkably quickly, within 16 hours of first exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From insects to impacts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers say this will help them understand addiction in humans. Now that scientists can study the process in fruit flies, the pipeline to new discoveries can be greatly accelerated, studying hundreds of potentially relevant genes in a much shorter time span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can scale research so quickly in flies,” Philyaw says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can identify risk genes that might be difficult to uncover in more complex organisms, and then we pass that information to researchers who work with mammalian models. Then, they’re able to uncover treatment targets that facilitate the jump from studying animal behavior to developing human therapeutics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rothenfluh agrees: “We can really start to understand the mechanisms of cocaine choice, and the more you understand about the mechanism, the more you have a chance to find a therapeutic that might act on that mechanism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to specific searches for therapeutics, Rothenfluh says basic research into the mechanisms of how the human mind—and the fruit fly mind—work can have unexpected impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just trying to understand the simple little fly brain can give us insights that you cannot anticipate,” he emphasizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Basic science is important, and you never know what exciting things you might find that turn out to be impactful for understanding the human condition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research is published in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience &lt;/em&gt;as “Bitter sensing protects Drosophila from developing experience-dependent cocaine consumption preference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The work was funded by the Huntsman Mental Health Institute, the University of Utah Molecular Medicine Program, and the National Institutes of Health, including the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (grant number R01DK110358), the National Institute on Drug Abuse (grants K01DA058919, R21DA049635, and R21DA040439), and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (grants R01AA026818, R01AA019536-S1, and R01AA030881).

Little is known about the specific genes and mechanisms that lead to the development of CUD, and there are currently no FDA-approved pharmacotherapies that can treat it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; has proven an effective model organism to identify genes and mechanisms underlying addiction, especially alcohol use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While flies exposed to cocaine display features of acute intoxication like those observed in mammals, including hyperactivity and reduced sleep, to date, there is no model of preferential cocaine self-administration in flies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we assayed cocaine consumption in &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; males, as well as preference in a two-choice paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also investigated mechanisms involved in cocaine taste sensing using genetic and imaging tools. We show that cocaine is innately aversive to flies and that this avoidance depends on bitter sensing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gustatory sensory neurons expressing the Gr66a bitter receptor are activated upon exposure to cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silencing of these bitter-sensing neurons or mutation of &lt;em&gt;Gr66a&lt;/em&gt; reduces cocaine avoidance. In a longitudinal choice assay, these flies develop preference for cocaine-containing solutions within 12-18 h, whereas control flies do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings show that bitter sensation protects flies from developing cocaine self-administration preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, silencing bitter perception enables us to use &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; as a model for experience-dependent cocaine self-administration preference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This opens the door to testing human variants associated with CUD for their causative role in cocaine self-administration in this highly tractable model organism.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 20:07:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE5zcG9MNlZ1MEdkbTdOc3hGcFNaYXhOMDhtUVE3TjRxSHdTM1kyaW1reG95TlJpSjdBRkF2RjdTTjM0eERDbS1MRW9FNktVYmNZTHB2UHBXLW95aTZyckZsWjJROFpXVC00NGFjMjVEYw</guid></item><item><title>心脏病：你吃的东西比切割碳水化合物、脂肪更重要-健康线 | Heart Disease: What You Eat Matters More Than Cutting Carbs, Fat - Healthline</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPUV9EZC1XQ25HUUg0RkdnbHBFV1VZQmZ3Vm9ubGlWVWRjajduRzhtT0prOHgwd0UxQUwxcWpHUlF2c2M0Z1laUlRzbkVKMG5lZTVpRWgxTFZTZ2liR1FNV3FwSVR6akVFVmowSEl5WGR2TUM1aXUxQlNVajBjU09xQi14eU5VRHFHS2dOVHREdWk5REp1bXUzOU9XNi10R3RIQ1E4d0FSdjI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-yhe8zq"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/healthy-produce-shopping-1296x728-header.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/healthy-produce-shopping-1296x728-header.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/healthy-produce-shopping-1296x728-header.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/healthy-produce-shopping-1296x728-header.jpg" alt="Produce in shopping bags in kitchen" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="icon-hl-pinterest css-1dn5h5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.healthline.com%2Fhealth-news%2Ffood-quality-lowers-heart-disease-risk-more-than-cutting-carbs-fat&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F06%2Fhealthy-produce-shopping-1296x728-header.jpg&amp;amp;description=Heart%20Disease%3A%20What%20You%20Eat%20Matters%20More%20Than%20Cutting%20Carbs%2C%20Fat" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/healthy-produce-shopping-1296x728-header.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-1dutyn6"&gt;Healthy low fat diets emphasizing high quality whole foods may help lower heart disease risk. Kseniya Ovchinnikova/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study suggests that food quality matters more than fat or carbs for heart health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A low carb, low fat diet could lack heart-protective nutrients and have too much of certain nutrients associated with heart disease risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A balanced diet with high quality, unprocessed foods is best for your heart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to heart health, the quality of the food you eat could matter a lot more than simply cutting carbohydrates or fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study suggests that rather than focusing solely on &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/micros-vs-macros" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;macronutrient&lt;/a&gt; counts, emphasizing whole, minimally processed, and plant-based foods while limiting refined grains, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/added-sugar-natural-sugar-guide" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;added sugars&lt;/a&gt;, and animal products can significantly reduce the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/coronary-artery-disease" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;coronary heart disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers’ findings highlight a shift toward more personalized and nuanced dietary guidance for cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, low-carbohydrate (low carb) and low fat diets have dominated nutrition advice as methods to improve health, manage weight, and reduce risks of chronic diseases such as heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the scientific community has debated how much these diets truly protect the heart, especially when the quality of foods consumed within these diets varies greatly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health shed light on this important question, concluding that food quality is just as critical, if not more so, than merely restricting carbs or fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers tracked participants’ dietary habits and heart disease outcomes over 25 years. Detailed food frequency questionnaires allowed the team to assign scores based on the healthfulness of the foods consumed within low carb and low fat diets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found a clear association between low carb and low fat diets that emphasize high quality foods (i.e., whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and legumes) and a roughly 15% lower risk of developing coronary heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, diets low in carbs or fat but high in unhealthy foods like refined grains, sugary snacks, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/why-processed-meat-is-bad/" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;processed meats&lt;/a&gt;, and animal fats carried a higher risk of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Healthy versions of these diets — those rich in plant-based foods and whole grains — were linked to better heart health outcomes and improved metabolic function. In contrast, low-carb and low-fat diets emphasizing unhealthy foods were associated with a higher risk of heart disease,” Lead study author Zhiyuan Wu, PhD, a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Nutrition at Harvard, explained in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1084802" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that simply cutting carbs or fats without considering the source and quality of these macronutrients can be counterproductive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To deepen their understanding, the research team also measured blood metabolites — a wide range of biological markers related to metabolism — in a subset of over 10,000 participants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This allowed them to observe how different diet qualities influenced metabolic regulation and &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cholesterol-test" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;lipid profiles&lt;/a&gt; in the body. The findings showed that healthy and unhealthy versions of low carb and low-fat diets distinctly affected plasma lipid species and other metabolites, which are important indicators of cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the study differentiated between various types of low carb and low fat diets. For example, “animal-based” low carb diets, which tend to be higher in saturated fats and proteins from animal products, were linked to increased heart disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, “vegetable-based” or plant-focused low carb diets showed more favorable outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, unhealthy low fat diets that rely heavily on &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/why-refined-carbs-are-bad" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;refined carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt; and added sugars also increased risk, whereas healthy low fat diets emphasizing whole foods lowered it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yaaboakye/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;Yaa Boakye&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist, personal trainer, and nutrition consultant, said it’s helpful to think of food quality like a grading rubric for your body. Boakye wasn’t involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Imagine asking a student to write a book report without providing the grading rubric; they may complete the assignment, but without clear direction, their work might miss the mark,” she told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boakye noted that food quality is akin to the rubric in that your body uses it to interpret what you eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is not enough to check off a box labeled ‘low carb’ or ‘low fat’ — we need to examine what is actually in the food: fiber content, added sugars, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-health-low-sodium-foods" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;sodium&lt;/a&gt;, micronutrients, and anti-inflammatory or proinflammatory compounds,” she explained, adding that carbohydrates, fats, and proteins are only broad categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A carbohydrate could be a refined white roll or a fiber-rich &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/lentils" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;lentil&lt;/a&gt;; a fat could be processed &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/why-trans-fats-are-bad" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;trans fat&lt;/a&gt; or cold-pressed &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-proven-benefits-of-olive-oil" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;olive oil&lt;/a&gt;,” she said. “Food quality helps us zoom in on these differences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boakye added that when individuals simply follow a low fat or low carb diet without considering these nuances, they tend to overlook important nutrients that have consequences for heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“High sodium levels, added sugars, lack of fiber, and insufficient &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/antioxidants-explained" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; are all red flags that often go unnoticed,” she said, adding that you could be meeting your macro targets but still consuming a diet conducive to &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/high-blood-pressure-hypertension" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;hypertension&lt;/a&gt;, poor cholesterol profiles, or systemic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A ‘low fat’ diet lacking &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-foods-high-in-magnesium" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/potassium" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;potassium&lt;/a&gt;, and omega-3s could backfire, while a ‘low carb’ plan omitting prebiotic-rich plants or colorful fruits might hinder &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/healthy/3-ways-healthy-gut-impacts-heart-health" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt; and indirectly stress the cardiovascular system,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She advised following the plate model, which involves filling one-half of your plate with vegetables and fruit, one-quarter with lean proteins (including meat, fish, beans, or lower-fat cheese), and one-quarter with whole grains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Making this your plate automatically reduces the amount of carbohydrate you eat and reduces the fat that you’re eating because it removes a lot of excess fats that can enter someone’s diet through eating higher fat foods,” she told Healthline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smart further noted that vegetables and fruit contain fiber, which helps keep you full so you’re less tempted to snack between meals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also contain vital nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, which help protect your heart and blood vessels. According to Smart, whole grains also contain fiber and B vitamins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“All this fiber helps better control blood sugar,” she said. “Poorly controlled blood sugar contributes to heart disease by damaging blood vessels, so better &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/14-ways-to-lower-blood-sugar" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;blood sugar control&lt;/a&gt; reduces heart disease risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smart added that eating lean proteins like &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/lean-protein-foods" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;lean meats&lt;/a&gt;, beans, and legumes helps keep your &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/saturated-fat-types" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;saturated fat &lt;/a&gt;intake low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that a diet filled with high quality foods will naturally include fewer &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-to-eat-less-processed-food" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;highly processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, which reduces your intake of sodium, saturated fat, and excess calories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reducing the amount of highly processed foods you eat helps to protect your cardiovascular health by helping to control blood pressure and reduce your risk of developing &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/heart-disease/atherosclerosis-when-it-starts" class="content-link css-1c2ok3c"&gt;atherosclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (hardening of the arteries) and helps to prevent excess weight gain,” Smart concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Healthline</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 19:58:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxPUV9EZC1XQ25HUUg0RkdnbHBFV1VZQmZ3Vm9ubGlWVWRjajduRzhtT0prOHgwd0UxQUwxcWpHUlF2c2M0Z1laUlRzbkVKMG5lZTVpRWgxTFZTZ2liR1FNV3FwSVR6akVFVmowSEl5WGR2TUM1aXUxQlNVajBjU09xQi14eU5VRHFHS2dOVHREdWk5REp1bXUzOU9XNi10R3RIQ1E4d0FSdjI</guid></item><item><title>一名儿童在美国购物中心患有麻疹，涉及不知道来源的州卫生官员- Star Tribune | A child had measles at Mall of America, concerning state health officials who don’t know source - Star Tribune</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiywFBVV95cUxNNkd5RzRwVUZxMDVXMWZqZHR3WEhTUDJ2S0tad3g2YjYxckpSUnV5Z19QMmhhaVhXTFE2dWFyRlZvcXZieWRlaXRRQ3Nnb0RUbkxPQ3hyUk10SElpMzE0N2U4QWV1UjVMNmNRcUpyVlpRNGhZOGJpOEd1MElSV0ozTV9PSHp0X1V1YjBhSERXYmV4RkRPeUhYOXFmdDRWYXk4c3ctYXZFRDhza3dPTDRhUXlzMTNTOUZHUnBiMGViTUZDMUZQdkNBeFZHVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;“Every once in a while, we do see someone that remembers something that they forgot to share with us,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;The state once had one of the highest vaccination rates in the U.S., but last fall it had one of the lowest rates of &lt;a href="https://www.startribune.com/as-measles-spreads-nationwide-fewer-minnesota-kindergartners-are-vaccinated-for-mmr/601336566" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.startribune.com/as-measles-spreads-nationwide-fewer-minnesota-kindergartners-are-vaccinated-for-mmr/601336566"&gt;children vaccinated for measles&lt;/a&gt; entering kindergarten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Angst among parents over the COVID-19 vaccines has resulted in skepticism of other vaccines, including the highly protective MMR vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella that is usually administered in two doses around 12 months and four years of age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="article-body-item" class="rt-Box  pb-5 article-body-rich-text"&gt;&lt;div class="rt-Box w-full"&gt;&lt;p class="rt-Text"&gt;Nationwide, more than 1,000 infections and three deaths have been reported this year, largely among unvaccinated children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Smaller than a pinpoint, the tiny invertebrates, which measure about 0.15 millimeters to 0.4 millimeters in length, live around the outer parts of hair follicles and feed on their oily contents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“While we are &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/26/health/snooze-alarm-waking-sleep-wellness"&gt;sleeping&lt;/a&gt;, they come out and are very happy, mating, visiting relatives, walking on our faces. The moment we wake up, they go back inside the pore,” said Alejandra Perotti, an associate professor of invertebrate biology at the University of Reading in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec1Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re creeped out, Perotti said, “don’t be.” Demodex mites are more often friends than foes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In exchange for cleaning the gunk out of our pores, we offer these miniature vacuums our melatonin, a hormone produced in the skin that puts us to sleep but gives the mites vital energy, Perotti said. And like microscopic vampires, the mites have evolved to avoid ultraviolet rays from the sun, which easily destroys their DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="smallTile1Mobile" class="mobile-ad small-tile centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The face typically has up to five mites per square centimeter — although without putting a sample of skin under a microscope, it’s impossible to see them with the naked eye.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If your immune system weakens, the mite populations can sometimes overproduce, leading to a host of skin and eye conditions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;When they ‘mite’ cause problems&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Demodex mites can multiply overnight, causing an overgrowth called demodicosis, said Dr. Richard Locksley, professor of medicine at University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec2Mobile" class="mobile-ad medium-rectangle centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Immunodeficient individuals, such as older adults or people on chemotherapy, are more vulnerable to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22775-demodex-face-mites"&gt;demodicosis&lt;/a&gt; and may have an inflammatory response to the mites and the bacteria that can colonize them, Locksley said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not totally known why some people experience inflammation from the mites, Locksley said. “But what is known is that wild animals don’t have any diseases from the mites, but domestic dogs and cats do. So perhaps when we moved into a different environment, and the way we evolved, a genetic mutation compromised our immune pathways.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The inflammation can manifest as rosacea, acne, dryness and flaking, especially on the cheeks, eyelids, forehead and creases where oil may accumulate, said Dr. Roberto Ricardo-Gonzalez, associate professor of dermatology at University of California, San Francisco, who worked closely with Locksley to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36044899/"&gt;research the mites.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To determine whether demodex mites are the cause of skin irritations, dermatologists can tape or lightly scrape the top layer of skin and place the sample under a microscope, Ricardo-Gonzalez said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During a routine eye exam, the doctor may check for a waxy buildup of demodex eggs and waste around the base of the eyelashes. said Dr. Cory Lappin, an Ohio optometrist. For patients with eyelid infections, this buildup is a common cause of dryness, itchiness, eyelash loss and even recurrent sties.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Preventing and treating overgrowth&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;For most healthy adults, there is no need to panic about demodex mites.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Most people are completely unaware they have the mites, and (it) should stay that way,” Locksley said. “You could do more harm picking around looking for problems than just being agnostic about it. And if you have problems, you should go talk to a physician first.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both Lappin and Ricardo-Gonzalez recommend maintaining a regular hygiene routine before bedtime, including a gentle cleanser to remove debris and excess oil from the face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mediumRec4Mobile" class="mobile-ad centered"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take off eye makeup and false lashes before sleep as well to keep the area clean and avoid irritating the delicate tissue around the eye, Lappin said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Those with acne-prone skin can use a topical retinoid one or two nights a week, Ricardo-Gonzalez said, noting that moderation is key to a bedtime skin care routine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’ve seen it in patients when you have moisture-barrier disruption, meaning your skin is overly dry or overproducing oil from inflammation or excessive washing. The mites can overgrow in those instances,” Ricardo-Gonzalez said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regular, adequate sleep is also important to prevent skin from overproducing sebum, the oily substance that’s like food for the mites, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9907625/"&gt;studies have shown.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To treat demodicosis, a dermatologist might prescribe topical or oral &lt;a href="https://www.jaadcasereports.org/article/S2352-5126(24)00276-5/fulltext"&gt;ivermectin&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the populations back to normal counts, Ricardo-Gonzalez said. It’s not possible, though, to completely rid yourself of the mites permanently.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-approvals-and-databases/drug-trials-snapshots-xdemvy#:~:text=The%20FDA%20approved%20XDEMVY%20based,833%20patients%20with%20Demodex%20blepharitis."&gt;US Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; approved medicated eye drops in 2023 to treat demodex-related eyelid inflammation, Lappin said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Here today, gone tomorrow?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Observed on humans for centuries, demodex mites are thought to be passed from contact with our mothers shortly after birth. Perotti and her research team &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/39/6/msac125/6604544?login=false"&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; in 2022, however, that these symbiotic creatures may be experiencing what she calls “a long-term evolutionary death.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When you have organisms that are exposed to this symbiotic life, it leads to genome erosion, or a loss of genes over time,” Perotti said. “We predict that this will continue to the point that (the mites) will disappear.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With no predators, external threats or competitors, demodex mites have no selective pressures, Perotti explained. And since they are passed down between related humans, the populations lack genetic diversity — in other words, they are inbred.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s unknown how long the extinction will take, but to Perotti, this is nothing to celebrate — or mourn — considering humans will likely adapt to need demodex mites less as they die out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There has been very bad talk about the mites for a long time. They have been blamed for a lot of problems, but the suppressed immune system is the problem, not the mite itself,” Perotti said. “We should think of them as our companions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>East Idaho News</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 19:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilwFBVV95cUxQQXA2eHI0a3VYcmx1a2FXbF8xM1JPNzFMc2otWlVXVUJlVlFld0phN29JVzJUVS1ZNGd3V1l2TUVqZFBJNm52T2htMGV2cnhiZUt6dEhjVi0yTEY4azQteEJWbnNhczBqSklSSno0RmdUbm13VmZla1JRTjROWTFWTjUtVlF6eWM4T1A4dkdIX2VOOVpkNXpz</guid></item><item><title>根据一项新的研究，喝咖啡与更长寿、更健康的生活有关-《纽约时报》 | Drinking Coffee Is Associated With a Longer, Healthier Life, According to a New Study - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxNNWptNUxtRG9JVVJ3TV9PWnhsQTN5RGZOMG45Wkgwdkg2UWtWSEpZUnVwdUN2Z1I1X0RZTHhkRmZfZ2xLVnAyeE16V254U2c2Mi1lNVVHX2NyczJ1LVVUV3NRTmctdWlOUVFjZVZhcEEzbENhdm85aDNmOFgwVXJWNjVtdU5xZEdudzlWazJxc0dNdE53?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Most people who drink coffee appreciate the quick jolt of energy it provides. But in a new study, presented today at the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition, scientists have found that coffee may offer the much longer-term benefit of healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The study has not been peer-reviewed or published, but it was rigorous and included a large number of women who were followed for many years. It also adds to a large body of evidence &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/01/well/eat/coffee-study-lower-dying-risk.html" title=""&gt;linking coffee to longer lives&lt;/a&gt; and various health advantages, including lower risks of certain chronic diseases — though all of these studies had limitations, including that they were observational and could not prove cause and effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Still, the results linking coffee to healthier aging were not surprising, said Fang Fang Zhang, a professor of nutritional epidemiology at Tufts University who was not involved with the study. “The data is quite consistent that coffee consumption is actually beneficial,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-13o6u42 eoo0vm40" id="link-241389e7"&gt;What did the new research find?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In the study, researchers followed more than 47,000 female nurses for several decades beginning in the 1970s. Every few years, the women answered detailed questions about their diets, including how much coffee, tea and cola (like Coca-Cola or Pepsi) they typically drank. Then, the scientists looked at how many of the women were still alive and met their definition of “healthy aging” in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Just over 3,700 women met that criteria: They were 70 or older; reported good physical and mental health, with no cognitive impairment or memory problems; and were free of 11 chronic diseases such as cancer, Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, kidney failure, Parkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The researchers found a correlation between how much caffeine the women typically drank (which was mostly from coffee) when they were between 45 and 60 years old and their likelihood of healthy aging. After adjusting for other factors that could affect aging, such as their overall diet, how much they exercised and whether they smoked, those who consumed the most caffeine (equivalent to nearly seven eight-ounce cups of coffee per day) had odds of healthy aging that were 13 percent higher than those who consumed the least caffeine (equivalent to less than one cup per day).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Those are signs of possible neuropathy, “a general term for nerve dysfunction in your limbs,” says Eva Feldman, a professor of neurology at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="35B5RILJJNDG7DPBYVRD4XVHNA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The likelihood of neuropathy appears to increase with age. That’s partly because the number of nerve cells in your body declines over the years, and those that remain become less functional. And “if they are damaged by injury or an underlying medical condition, they struggle more to recover,” says Anne Louise Oaklander, an associate professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="25OPPFITJNGB7KGSQW4SOUFHKI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Chronic conditions such as diabetes, as well as autoimmune disease and treatments such as some kinds of chemotherapy, can cause neuropathy, too, Oaklander says. Long-term untreated hypothyroidism, kidney disease and obesity also can increase the risk, according to the Mayo Clinic. Another potential cause is &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/supplements/supplements-that-might-actually-help-you-a6441144119/" target="_blank"&gt;vitamin B12 deficiency&lt;/a&gt;, which is thought to affect at least 20 percent of adults over age 60, says Kunal Desai, an assistant professor of neurology at the Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut. Here’s what to do if you think you have neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="N5PFRVWKWFG5TASIAFIG45VCVA" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="N5PFRVWKWFG5TASIAFIG45VCVA" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Spotting the signs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VU3QXHFEKFA6PLU4MNONKWKM6E" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Tingling or painful sensations in your hands and/or feet are the main symptoms. “Patients often describe it as feeling like ants crawling on their feet, or even as prickling or burning,” Feldman says. Another red flag is numbness in your hands or feet that leaves you feeling unsteady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IZJUR3C6SRC7TN5AEA6DDYPZPI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you have any of the above, call your doctor right away. That’s especially important if you have a chronic condition such as Type 2 diabetes or you’re being treated with certain chemotherapy drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="AKSYXMAVNRDDVJHPPF5JPRZYMI" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="AKSYXMAVNRDDVJHPPF5JPRZYMI" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Getting diagnosed&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FEP2NAE7H5CDFJ6VO2ZL5O653I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Your primary care practitioner will examine you, including the skin on your hands and feet, to look for fissures or cracks. They’ll test your reflexes and might use a tuning fork in the area to see whether you can feel the vibration or prick you with a pin to see whether you feel pain. They might check the strength in your hands and feet, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NP754FUZ4ZHRPASNM7H3RDJBVE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If any results are abnormal, you’ll probably have tests of your nerves for confirmation and, if those results are abnormal, blood tests to check for contributing conditions such as Type 2 diabetes, Oaklander says. If the neuropathy is on only one side or is worse on one side, Feldman says, you’ll need to see a neurologist to rule out more serious conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="LABFAZMGDBHIZMBJWZGRYL4JWM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="LABFAZMGDBHIZMBJWZGRYL4JWM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Finding relief&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JRNMGGA43BDDRCSEYZKUOEBXTA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;How your neuropathy is treated usually depends on the cause, Feldman says. If it’s Type 2 diabetes, exercise and weight loss, if needed, can improve symptoms, according to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10112836/" target="_blank"&gt;2022 review in the journal Lancet Neurology&lt;/a&gt;. Neuropathy due to an autoimmune disorder, hypothyroidism or a vitamin B12 deficiency often eases once the underlying condition is corrected. If it’s caused by chemotherapy, your doctor may change your regimen or advise a treatment break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SWDIQJPD7VHFZAK6XPSM3RHXPI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If those steps aren’t enough, medication may help. The American Academy of Neurology advises trying tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors such as duloxetine (Cymbalta) and venlafaxine (Effexor ER) or gabapentinoids like gabapentin (Neurontin and others). A topical prescription capsaicin patch helps, but it can cause a rash or burning sensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BWZ6K56U7FEXBF2JDTZAFQAPXQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you have foot neuropathy, you should see a podiatrist several times a year to have your feet checked for sores, ulcers and signs of infection. You should also examine your feet daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="76UH62JNU5BYLBBCA5PGTH2VZM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And if you’re 50 or older, experts say to make sure to get Shingrix, the two-dose shingles vaccine. &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/health/shingles/how-to-prevent-shingles-and-what-to-do-if-you-get-it-a9614358699/" target="_blank"&gt;Shingles&lt;/a&gt; can cause a painful condition called postherpetic neuralgia, which has symptoms similar to neuropathy, Feldman says.

These teens reported higher negative urgency and lower perseverance, meaning they were more likely to act rashly under stress and abandon difficult tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, no link was found between biological circadian timing and impulsivity, suggesting psychological or behavioral influences may play a greater role.

In contrast, there was no association between objectively measured circadian phase and impulsivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Surprisingly, we did not find a significant link between dim light melatonin onset and impulsivity in our sample,” said lead author Riya Mirchandaney, who is a doctoral candidate in clinical-health psychology at the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This suggests that there may be unmeasured psychological or behavioral factors influencing both impulsivity and the self-assessment of circadian preference, regardless of the timing of an individual’s internal circadian clock.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, circadian rhythms are internal biological rhythms that exist in all living organisms. This timekeeping system, or “body clock,” is synchronized to the 24-hour, light-dark cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Circadian preference reflects an individual’s desired timing of sleep and wake, and circadian timing can be objectively measured by analyzing saliva or blood plasma to detect dim light melatonin onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved 210 adolescents across two studies. They had a mean age of 17 years, and 60.5% were female.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed self-reported measures of impulsivity and circadian preference. Laboratory samples of saliva were taken to assess circadian phase by determining dim light melatonin onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a week-long protocol, participants also wore a wrist actigraph to estimate sleep midpoint and duration, and at bedtime they completed an assessment of impulsivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mirchandaney emphasized that the results could influence future research to help teens avoid the negative effects of impulsivity, which is a well-established contributor to alcohol and substance use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Adolescence may be a prime opportunity for preventing adverse outcomes associated with impulsivity using chronotherapeutic interventions to advance sleep and circadian timing,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study was supported by grants from the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism within the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this impulsivity, neurodevelopment, and circadian rhythm research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aasm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hannah Miller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aasm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AASM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Hannah Miller – AASM&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will be presented at SLEEP 2025&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 19:31:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTE03REdvUENMVC13UkRoajEtd3pWOXh5UkM3RnY3NGtPems5WEVseGhaeVV0WlZLRmFSZUJLSHJzOXA0dHBaaVMzNU1LYVhhYXRhVUNxc3lhT2EwakJ1dWJfVVkwS2Q3SnZETGc</guid></item><item><title>科学家偶然发现世界上最古老的胃石化石--银河日报 | Scientists Stumble Upon The World’s Oldest Stomach Stone Fossil - The Daily Galaxy</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE4xMGgtWHBMNHV3aEVlU3pfS25OVUFlR21BbGh1azdkcEJWc0xPQ3FibzBDWW16WE5ORXVKOG9jcGkxY3I1LVNjYlBXVndhUnU5S2t1Um12Z1VONXVZaC11QUdEUGN0M2xzanhiX3p1RnM3X0xjX1BxYVpTMA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paleontologists have discovered what is believed to be the &lt;strong&gt;oldest stomach stone fossil&lt;/strong&gt;, dating back approximately &lt;strong&gt;150 million years&lt;/strong&gt;. This remarkable find was made on England’s renowned &lt;strong&gt;Jurassic Coast&lt;/strong&gt;, a UNESCO World Heritage Site famous for its extensive geological history spanning the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods. The detailed study of this specimen was published recently in a peer-reviewed article in the&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016787823000421?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Journal of the Geological Society&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Rare Discovery Along The Jurassic Coast&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Jurassic Coast&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;UNESCO World Heritage Site &lt;/a&gt;stretching nearly 100 miles from East Devon to Dorset, is renowned for its rich and continuous geological history covering the Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous periods. It is in this dramatic landscape, specifically in Kimmeridge, Dorset, that Dr. Steve Etches MBE &lt;strong&gt;unearthed the 150-million-year-old &lt;/strong&gt;stomach stone. This discovery significantly extends the known fossil record of calculi, such as stomach and bladder stones, by almost 59 million years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/ancient-roman-boundary-stone-discovered-israel/" data-type="post" data-id="77451"&gt;stones&lt;/a&gt;, known as gastroliths, are typically formed in the digestive systems of animals, but identifying the exact species they originated from is often a challenge without direct skeletal association. &lt;a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/news/2023/Research-News/Nigel-Larkin-Dorset-Stomach-Stone" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Nigel Larkin&lt;/a&gt;, a paleontologist and Visiting Research Fellow at the University of Reading, explained the difficulty in identifying the source of these stones: “Unless stomach stones are actually f&lt;strong&gt;ound preserved within a skeleton&lt;/strong&gt; it is almost impossible to tell what sort of animal it might have formed inside.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Insights into Prehistoric Marine Reptiles&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The size of the stomach stone, combined with its geological context in Upper Jurassic clay, strongly suggests it formed inside a large marine reptile. Larkin pointed out that it likely belonged to creatures such as an &lt;strong&gt;ichthyosaur&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; plesiosaur&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;pliosaur,&lt;/strong&gt; or even an &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/12-million-year-old-crocodile-fossil-found-in-peru-what-it-reveals-about-a-lost-world/" data-type="post" data-id="77648"&gt;ancient crocodilian&lt;/a&gt;. He emphasized that the stone did not come from a dinosaur, as dinosaurs were terrestrial animals, but underlined the find’s significance: “The stomach stone did not come from a dinosaur – as dinosaurs lived on land – but this is still a very exciting and rare discovery.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ivan Sansom, Senior Lecturer in Palaeobiology at the University of Birmingham, conducted detailed microscopic analyses to confirm the &lt;strong&gt;stone’s structure and composition&lt;/strong&gt;. His research concluded the specimen possesses all the characteristics typical of a calculus formed within a gastrointestinal tract, confirming it as a genuine stomach stone fossil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Fossilized Stomach Stones Expose Ancient Diets&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gastroliths&lt;/strong&gt; have been found in a variety of extinct and extant animals, serving different roles such as aiding digestion or providing ballast for aquatic creatures. The discovery of this exceptionally old stomach stone adds a new chapter to our understanding of how &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/sea-monster-morocco-carinodens-acrodon/" data-type="post" data-id="75903"&gt;marine reptiles&lt;/a&gt; from the Jurassic seas processed their food. It implies these animals used gastroliths similarly to some modern species, grinding food in their stomachs or stabilizing their buoyancy in the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The fossil’s preservation and age make it a valuable record for paleontologists, offering a rare glimpse into the physiology and behavior of marine reptiles living 150 million years ago. The &lt;a href="https://jurassiccoast.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Jurassic Coast&lt;/a&gt;, with its&lt;strong&gt; continuous sedimentary layers&lt;/strong&gt;, continues to be a rich source for such extraordinary finds, bridging the gap between ancient ecosystems and modern science.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ST PAUL, Minn. — The Minnesota Department of Health has confirmed two new &lt;a href="/article/news/local/minnesota-reports-first-measles-case-of-2025/89-ca48893e-8de0-4a0e-954c-5da5bc03239d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;cases of measles&lt;/a&gt;, including a case involving community exposure at the Mall of America.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MDH investigators say a child was infectious while visiting the indoor theme park at the Mall of America on May 24. People who were at the mall between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. that day may have been exposed to the virus and should monitor for symptoms from May 31 through June 14, according to the MDH news release.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials continue to emphasize the importance of getting vaccinated for measles, which is the best defense against the virus. Children should receive two doses: the first between 12 and 15 months of age and the second between ages 4 and 6. Infants as young as 6 months can receive the vaccine early if travel puts them at higher risk. The Centers for Disease Control says the measles vaccine is 97% effective at preventing measles after exposure for those who have received two doses, and 93% effective for those who have received a single dose.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Measles spreads easily, and it finds those who are vulnerable," Jessica Hancock-Allen, director of the infectious disease division at MDH, said in the release. "We are seeing increased measles cases throughout the U.S. and internationally this year. The time is now for families to make sure their children are up to date on their immunizations to protect them from this potentially serious disease."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious illness that spreads through coughing, sneezing, or simply being in the same room as someone infected. The virus can linger in the air for up to two hours. Initial symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose and watery eyes, followed by a rash that usually starts on the head and spreads to the body. Symptoms typically appear eight to 12 days after exposure, with the rash developing two to three days after the onset of fever. People who develop symptoms are advised to call their healthcare provider before visiting a clinic to avoid exposing others. Most people born before 1957 are considered immune due to past infection.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said the other unrelated case involved an adult from Washington County with an unverified vaccination status who was exposed during domestic air travel outside Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two new cases bring the state's total to four so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both patients are recovering at home. Health officials are working with local departments and Twin Cities-area locations to notify those who may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Anytime we confirm a case of measles unrelated to travel that has no known source it is worrying," Hancock-Allen said in the release. "This is because it could be a sign that measles is spreading in the community undetected by public health and healthcare systems. It is uncertain where the child was exposed and whether others may have been exposed."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

The study was presented as an abstract, but a more in-depth manuscript of the investigation will be submitted for peer review in the coming months, Mahdavi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The women were surveyed in middle age and followed for 30 years to understand their rates of death and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this study, we found that moderate caffeinated coffee consumption during midlife was associated with a higher likelihood of healthy aging 30 years later,” Mahdavi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;It’s not just any caffeinated drink&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects were found in caffeinated coffee in particular, according to the research. The same link was not found for tea or decaffeinated coffee — and drinking more cola or other caffeinated sodas was tied to a lower chance of healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This would imply that coffee in particular has health preserving or promoting effects,” said Dr. David Kao, Jacqueline Marie Schauble Leaffer Endowed Chair in Women’s Heart Disease and associate professor of medicine at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical School in an email. “As with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5871637/#:~:text=Higher%20coffee%20intake%20was%20significantly,compared%20to%20exclusive%20coffee%20drinkers%5D." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:other studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt;, they also appear to have found that coffee has a particular benefit over other caffeinated drinks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Drinking one to three cups of coffee daily was associated with lower disease and better cognition in older age, the study showed. - Jacob Wackerhausen/iStockphoto/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, the research is high quality, added Kao, who was not involved in the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is also observational, meaning it is limited in its ability to examine direct cause and effect. The new research can only show that a behavior and an outcome are more likely to occur together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers did take that into account and adjusted for other factors that could link coffee drinking and healthy aging such as lifestyle, demographic and other dietary differences, but it is still possible there is another variable at play, Mahdavi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the link between coffee and healthy aging isn’t surprising –– it is consistent with prior research, Kao said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderate coffee drinking has been linked before to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/27/health/coffee-heart-benefits-wellness?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lower risks of chronic diseases;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lower risks of chronic diseases&lt;/a&gt; like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is it time to start drinking coffee?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does this mean you should take on a coffee habit if you don’t have one already? Not necessarily, Mahdavi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Coffee may support longevity, but it’s not a universal prescription — especially for women. Hormonal shifts influence how caffeine is metabolized, so the benefits depend on timing, biology, and individual health,” she said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estrogen inhibits a liver enzyme that is crucial for breaking down caffeine, which means that caffeine may last longer in the body of some people, especially those going through hormonal transitions such as menopause or pregnancy or those using oral contraception, Mahdavi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Midlife, the time period examined in this study, is a life stage marked by hormonal and metabolic shifts for women, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Moderate caffeinated coffee consumption — typically one to three cups per day — can be part of a healthy diet for many adults,” Mahdavi said. “However, this should not be taken as a blanket recommendation for everyone to begin or increase coffee intake with the goal of longevity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For one thing, the data can’t say whether increasing coffee consumption would help to preserve health, Kao said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In other words, although women who drink 3 cups of coffee/day might have better long-term functioning than non-coffee drinkers, we don’t know if non-coffee drinkers started drinking 3 cups a day, whether they would have better functioning than if they remained non-coffee drinkers,” he said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who needs to watch their coffee intake?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings do suggest that people don’t necessarily need to decrease their coffee consumption in the name of healthy aging, Kao said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Coffee is an important and positive part of daily life in many cultures around the world, he said. “For many … the knowledge that a daily coffee or 3 is probably not harmful is welcome news.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, some people do need to watch their coffee consumption, including those with high blood pressure, heart disease, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10867825/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anxiety;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;anxiety&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein continues to be a hot topic in the wellness world, and rightfully so!&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Protein is essential for building and repairing muscle, and it also helps with satiety (feeling full) and boosting metabolism,” says &lt;a href="https://www.jamieleerdn.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jamie Lee McIntyre, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. How? “Your body burns more calories digesting protein compared to fats (this is called the thermic effect of food, or TEF),” she explains. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Thanks to two large eggs (plus a little protein from the whole wheat bread), this breakfast provides 18 grams of protein per serving—or more, depending on the bread you use. While more research is needed, studies suggest regular egg consumption may reduce your risk of metabolic syndrome.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Eggs may also be beneficial for increasing muscle mass, which is one of the main factors &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7937672/how-to-calculate-your-metabolism/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;determining your resting metabolic rate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s High in Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The combo of raspberries, whole grain bread and spinach results in a whopping 7 grams of fiber—25% of the daily value—per serving. Despite being essential for digestive and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-improve-metabolic-syndrome-8742510" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;metabolic health&lt;/a&gt;, most Americans aren’t eating enough fiber, with only about 1 in 20 people meeting the daily recommended amount.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Fiber helps prevent the blood sugar roller coaster that can crash your energy, create more cravings, make you eat more and stall your metabolism,” says &lt;a href="http://www.simplywellnessllc.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Samantha Peterson, MS, RD&lt;/a&gt;. “When blood sugar is stable, your body is more efficient at burning fat for fuel, supporting steady energy, brain focus, higher metabolism, muscle support and hormone balance,” she adds. Certain types of fiber, called prebiotics, are also beneficial for metabolism, thanks to their role in the formation of short-chain fatty acids—byproducts of prebiotic fermentation that play a key role in energy metabolism.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Provides Magnesium &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-benefits-8656021" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; might not be the first nutrient that comes to mind when you think of metabolic health, this micronutrient actually plays a big role in supporting a healthy metabolism.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “This is a great breakfast to support your metabolism because spinach is a source of magnesium,” says &lt;a href="https://jenniferawagner.my.canva.site/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Jennifer Wagner, RDN, LDN&lt;/a&gt;, adding, “Magnesium is an important mineral that helps your body turn food into fuel. Without enough magnesium in your dietary patterns, your metabolism can become sluggish, which can lead to lower energy levels.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What’s more, magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels and combat inflammation, making it a helpful nutrient in the prevention of obesity and other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-metabolic-syndrome-11736662" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;metabolic disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In addition to protein, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7960178/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-eggs-every-day/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eggs&lt;/a&gt; are a convenient source of healthy fats—another micronutrient with metabolism benefits.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Including healthy fats helps balance blood sugar levels and supports metabolic health. These fats are essential for hormone regulation, which is important for metabolism,” explains McIntyre. One serving of this Spinach &amp;amp; Egg Scramble provides 16 grams of fat, with only 4 grams from saturated fat.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-skip-breakfast-8417958" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Eating a nutritious breakfast&lt;/a&gt; is just one piece of the puzzle. Here are three additional strategies for promoting better metabolic health: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Quality Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;: Poor sleep can negatively impact metabolic health. Aim for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-6-hours-of-sleep-enough-8692438" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;7–9 hours of quality sleep&lt;/a&gt; each night to support optimal body functions and hormone regulation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage Stress&lt;/strong&gt;: Chronic stress can disrupt hormonal balance and slow down metabolism. Practice &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/ways-to-relieve-stress-in-10-minutes-8739935" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;stress-relieving activities&lt;/a&gt; like meditation, yoga or deep breathing exercises to help provide grounding and calm.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engage in Regular Physical Activity&lt;/strong&gt;: Incorporating &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-exercise-30-min-every-day-8384757" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;regular exercise&lt;/a&gt; into your routine is a powerful way to support your metabolism.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Resistance activities, such as strength training, help build muscle, which increases resting metabolic rate, while aerobic exercises, like running or cycling, boost overall calorie burn. Aim for a combination of both to maximize the benefits and maintain a healthy, active lifestyle.&lt;/li&gt;

Traditionally, supplements allow athletes the ability to do more exercise and add lean muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;You may have heard your gym buddy, a co-worker or family member talking about taking a supplement called creatine. It is a billion-dollar supplement that is exploding in popularity, but should you take it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grand View Research expects sales of creatine to explode to over $4 billion at the end of the decade. Sales have more than doubled in the last five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a number of things that I think are pushing creatine,” said Michael Rivas, dietitian and specialist in sports dietetics with the University of Maryland Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creatine is something your body is creating and naturally storing, according to Rivas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you are supplementing it, all you’re doing is encouraging the body to store more of it,” Rivas said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creatine gives muscles extra energy, including your brain. Traditionally, supplements allow athletes the ability to do more exercise and add lean muscle mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popularity of the supplement, specifically creatine monohydrate, has grown outside the gym because of new studies that show its benefits.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are testing creatine for everything from, you know, the sports performance as we were before, to cognitive benefit. I’ve actually seen a couple studies lately for creatine and menopause as well,” Rivas said. “We’re looking toward creatine either delaying or helping with Alzheimer’s and cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these studies showing the cognitive benefits of creatine are early and based on relatively small samples, but Rivas hopes in the next decade definitive research will emerge touting its benefits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it safe for you to take?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For your average individual with healthy kidney function, perfectly fine,” Rivas said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk to your doctor about a recommended dose.&lt;/p&gt;

These PVs act like circuit breakers, briefly reducing their activity to allow learning-related neurons to strengthen connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using optogenetics and virtual reality mazes in mice, researchers found that learning was blocked when PV inhibition didn’t decrease at the right time. The findings challenge the idea that more brain activity always equals more learning and could reshape approaches to Alzheimer’s and memory enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Inhibition:&lt;/strong&gt; Parvalbumin interneurons reduce activity just before learning moments, allowing memory-related circuits to strengthen.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Predictive Signal:&lt;/strong&gt; The decrease in inhibition predicted a reward before it occurred, revealing how the brain primes itself for learning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Improper timing of inhibition may explain memory impairments in Alzheimer’s and learning disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Georgia Institute of Technology&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nuri Jeong remembers the feeling of surprise she felt during a trip back to South Korea, while visiting her grandmother, who’d been grappling with Alzheimer’s disease. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hadn’t seen her in six years, but she recognized me,” said Jeong, a former graduate researcher in the lab of Annabelle Singer in the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110560"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows AI representations of neurons." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/06/inhibitory-neurons-learning-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers found that when PVs reduce their activity, it clears the way for excitatory neurons, which drive brain activity, to strengthen their bonds and reinforce learning. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t expect that. Even though my grandmother struggled to remember other family members that she saw all the time, she somehow remembered me,” Jeong added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It made me wonder how the brain distinguishes between familiar and new experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That experience inspired Jeong to embark on a deep-dive exploration of spatial learning and memory, which has resulted in a new study published this month in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their article, Jeong, Singer, and a team of Georgia Tech researchers explain how the brain rapidly learns and remembers important locations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The brain relies on spatial learning to navigate the world, whether it’s finding a shortcut through a new neighborhood or remembering where you parked your car,” said Jeong, the paper’s lead author.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clearing the Way for Learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most research focuses on excitatory neurons in spatial learning. Jeong, Singer, and team went in a different direction, probing the crucial role of inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the team looked at the role of inhibitory neurons called parvalbumin interneurons, or PVs, in the hippocampus — a small part of the brain that helps with learning, memory, and spatial navigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that when PVs reduce their activity, it clears the way for excitatory neurons, which drive brain activity, to strengthen their bonds and reinforce learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Think of PVs as a kind of circuit breaker that keeps our brain circuits from going haywire,” said Singer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research shows that inhibition isn’t static but plays a much more dynamic role in how we learn and remember. It isn’t just about putting the brakes on to keep our brains in check. It’s about precisely timing the release of inhibition to let the brain rapidly encode important information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used optogenetics — a technique for controlling neurons with light — to manipulate interneurons in real time. They monitored thousands of neurons in the mouse brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As animals ran through a virtual reality maze and learned the location of a reward, PVs decreased activity before the award was even reached. Meanwhile, when the researchers prevented this decrease in inhibition, the animals failed to learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised that PVs decreased their firing as animals approach a learned reward zone,” Singer said. “The decrease actually predicted the reward. This challenges the traditional idea that more neural activity always equates to learning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selective Inhibition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has potential implications for Alzheimer’s research, according to Singer, because inhibition is impaired in the disease. She and her team want to understand why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we think of Alzheimer’s, we often think about an overactive brain,” she said. “But it isn’t just a volume problem. It’s a timing and location problem. If inhibition isn’t decreasing in the right place in the right moments, the brain may struggle to form new memories. “&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study findings have potential applications for Alzheimer’s, learning disabilities, even techniques to enhance memory through non-invasive brain stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“By studying how the healthy brain learns, we’re uncovering fundamental principles that could have far-reaching implications,” said Singer, who plans to explore how PVs function in disease models, going forward. “If we can identify what goes wrong in these circuits, we might find ways to restore normal function and improve spatial learning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Jeong, the research inspired by her grandmother remains personal. Before earning her Ph.D. in neuroscience from Emory in 2023, she got into an auto accident that set her back for a few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had plenty of time during her recovery to think of her future. Now she uses her neuroscience expertise as a corporate trainer and personal coach under the umbrella of her company, Goals Unhindered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But my first love was research, and this study is a reminder for me that inhibition in the brain, like setbacks in life, isn’t just about stopping activity,” she said. “It’s about learning and shaping new memories, and how we make our way in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this learning and memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6300010211190f0611502304021706000b4d060716" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Catherine Barzler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://gatech.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Georgia Institute of Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Catherine Barzler – Georgia Institute of Technology&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08868-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Goal-specific hippocampal inhibition gates learning&lt;/a&gt;” by Nuri Jeong et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goal-specific hippocampal inhibition gates learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goal-directed navigation in a new environment requires quickly identifying and exploiting important locations. Identifying new goal locations depends on neural computations that rapidly represent locations and connect location information to key outcomes such as food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the mechanisms to trigger these computations at behaviourally relevant locations are not well understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show that parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons in the mouse hippocampal CA3 have a causal role in identifying and exploiting new food locations such that decreases in inhibitory activity around goals enable reactivation to bind goal locations to food outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PV interneurons in the CA3 substantially reduce firing on approach to and at goal locations while food-deprived mice learn to find food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These inhibitory decreases anticipate reward locations as the mice learn and are more prominent on correct trials. Sparse optogenetic stimulation to prevent goal-related decreases in PV interneuron firing impaired learning of goal locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disrupting goal-related decreases in PV interneuron activity impaired the reactivation of new goal locations after receipt of food, a process that associates previous locations to food outcomes such that the mice know where to seek food later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results reveal that goal-selective and goal-predictive decreases in inhibitory activity enable learning, representations and outcome associations of crucial locations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 18:15:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTFBkQURLcU81MU01eU1YaFAtX24yRm56a2MweHRNQkhBQnZDYmFXTkJ6VEt2bzBiV1QxWlF1cURNRnk5VnNCLTYwM0NFYU11VXdDaUk4eXRfRHdvZ0VCa183eUJXU2VrbEZzdjBDbGpHcC1qLWhxYmJOa2Fn</guid></item><item><title>医生对Ozempic、Mounjaro和Wegovy不可逆转的“副作用”发出令人担忧的警告- LADbible | Doctors issue worrying warning about irreversible ‘side effect’ of Ozempic, Mounjaro and Wegovy - LADbible</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxPSkloRXdybTBvOHBQVklscWV0dDNiQWFMRkFWb3FKLW9lWkpVb1hJUTlTX0FWY09LT1J3OXpMdHVUNUg0eUs4Yy1hVXRkV3FFT2MzbEVoSFlNREZsWkRWVXhXT1JPSmU0VWFWV0Z1WEdqSWxDTXhLdC02T3NINlJhRUtMVDk3bk9fYVB3RE1FM0U1Q18tRzdKblAycXQwOU9HRnRZYkdlYlNLSDdIOGhNLTRn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Doctors have issued a warning about a potentially irreversible side effect that could impact anyone taking the likes of Ozempic, Mounjaro and Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Each of the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/drugs"&gt;drugs&lt;/a&gt; - which are primarily prescribed for those with Type-2 diabetes - contain GLP-1 agonists, which have now been linked to a devastating side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;We have already seen the likes of &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/jeremy-clarkson"&gt;Jeremy Clarkson&lt;/a&gt; open up about the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/entertainment/celebrity/jeremy-clarkson-weight-loss-ozempic-heart-stent-232241-20250330"&gt;terrible impact&lt;/a&gt; Ozempic had on his body as he sought to lose weight - despite the drug in particular not being approved for weight loss here in &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/uk-news"&gt;the UK&lt;/a&gt; - but that seemingly isn't putting off more and more of the general public who are turning to these drugs as a surefire way to shed some pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Doctors across the world &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/ozempic-simulation-health-weight-loss-doctor-youtube-763204-20250528"&gt;have already warned about the short-term and long-term complications&lt;/a&gt; that can arise from taking medicines such as these, with the pharmaceutical companies behind them also urging the public to get a genuine prescription before taking them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Doctors are worried about the potential side effect that many have experienced from taking drugs like Ozempic, Mounjaro and Wegovy (Getty Stock Image)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Novo Nordisk, Ozempic's manufacturer, previously told LADbible Group: "Wegovy®▼ (semaglutide injection) and Ozempic® (semaglutide injection) are prescription only medicines and require a healthcare professional to prescribe under strict supervision."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;But now, doctors and The Royal Osteoporosis Society (ROS) are warning that those who are taking the drugs for illicit reasons could end up losing weight not just in fat, but in vital muscle and bone mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Losing this muscle can impair someone's strength and joint stability, while reduced bone density also raises the risk of osteoporosis, a condition which can cause brittle bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Speaking to LADbible group, Julia Thomson, ROS Nurse Manager and Osteoporosis Specialist Nurse, said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“It has long been recognised that extreme and rapid weight loss can impact negatively on bone and muscle mass, this is a risk regardless of the way in which weight is lost. We are unaware of any other mechanism (other than the weight loss) via which GLP1’s may impact negatively on bone. It is important to remember that there are also many health risks associated with obesity (including osteoporosis).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;“A balance is required, but this can only be achieved if these drugs are used under the care of a responsible prescriber such as a GP or recognised online provider. This ensures that GLP1’s are prescribed appropriately to those who need it, weight loss is monitored, and nutritional support is provided. A good well-balanced calcium and protein rich diet is particularly important for bones, and it is vital to stay active and incorporate regular exercise into your routine to ensure that bones stay strong and healthy.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nuts are our No. 1 snack to support gut health with the combo of protein, fiber and healthy fats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look for unsalted and no-sugar-added nuts with 6 g to 20 g of protein and 3 g of fiber per serving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other gut-friendly plant-based snacks to look for include hummus, smoothies and edamame.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These days, going with your gut means practicing the habits that support your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8017087/things-you-should-do-every-day-for-gut-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt;. Taking care of the trillions of bacteria that reside in your gut benefits your digestive system, immune system, metabolism and more. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One of the most important things you can do to feed the good microbes that reside in your gut is to maintain a healthy diet, including incorporating &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut-friendly foods&lt;/a&gt; into your everyday meals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, that might include fruits, veggies and probiotic-packed foods like yogurt. But what about when it’s 3 p.m. and you’re looking for a salty snack? GI docs say that it can be easy to find the best snack for your gut health—as long as you know exactly what to look for.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We spoke with &lt;a href="https://www.guttheoryhealth.com/janese-laster-md/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Janese Laster, M.D&lt;/a&gt;., a board-certified gastroenterologist, an expert in nutrition and obesity medicine, and the founder of Gut Theory Total Digestive Care in Washington, D.C. Her solution for a gut-healthy snack is simple: look for plant-based protein and reach for the nuts.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-nuts-are-the-best-snack-for-gut-health"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Nuts Are the Best Snack for Gut Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nuts are an ideal combination of the gut-healthy nutrients that GI docs recommend. Both nuts by the handful and nut butter make great between-meal bites. What’s more, you can eat them in so many ways.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nuts are a perfect combo of protein and fiber. Good &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/make-ahead-high-protein-snacks-11680376" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-protein snack options&lt;/a&gt; should have 6 to 20 grams of protein, and you should look for at least 3 grams of fiber in a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8024516/best-high-fiber-snack-foods/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high-fiber snack&lt;/a&gt;. For example, 2 tablespoons of almond butter has about 7 grams of protein and more than 3 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (Add an apple to this and you’ll get even more fiber.) One quarter-cup of shelled pistachios contains about 6 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8027688/are-nuts-good-for-you/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Nuts&lt;/a&gt; can be prepared in different ways, such as roasted and salted or flavored. If you have diabetes or high blood pressure, consider looking for unsalted, plain nuts to limit sodium intake. Similarly, when choosing nut butters, look for those that contain nuts and salt or nuts only, which will limit added sugars. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The more minimally processed, the better. Laster explains that processed foods with added sugars, sodium, emulsifiers and additives—such as chips, cookies, candy and soda—aren’t the best snacks for long-term gut health. While all foods can fit in a healthy eating plan, when you have gut health specifically in mind, go for less-processed options.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you want to choose a snack with your gut microbiome in mind, Laster recommends looking for one that is high in plant-based protein. Think nuts (pistachios, walnuts, almonds), dried edamame, hummus and vegetables, fruit with nut butter and &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/261428/chocolate-peanut-butter-protein-shake/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;protein shakes&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Why plant-based protein? Laster says that this type of snack provides two important nutrients important for a healthy gut: protein and fiber. “[Snacks] high in plant-based protein and fiber help feed colonic cells and diversify the microbiome,” she explains. A diverse mix of bacteria in your gut helps keep your body healthy and resilient. Lower bacterial diversity, on the other hand, is associated with inflammation and chronic disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What’s more, microbes in your colon ferment the fiber in these plant proteins, producing short-chain fatty acids, which maintain your &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/sneaky-signs-of-leaky-gut-syndrome-8421526" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut barrier&lt;/a&gt;, suppress inflammation and regulate your metabolism.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; By choosing a snack that is high in plant-based protein, you are getting the best of both worlds. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Thankfully, choosing a snack that is high in plant-based protein isn’t that difficult of a task. There are plenty of snacks easy to grab on the go, such as bags of nuts or pre-portioned hummus cups. But if you’re looking to prepare a few gut-friendly snacks at home, here are some of our favorites that are packed with plant-based protein.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To make the most of your snack time and take care of your gut health, gastroenterologists recommend finding a snack that is high in plant-based protein and fiber, nutrients that help feed and diversify the good bacteria in the gut. The foods that fit the bill are nuts and nut butter. Other good-for-your-gut snacks include hummus and vegetables, and protein shakes made with plant-based protein.&lt;br&gt;

But the CEO of drug giant Pfizer has sprung to Moderna 's defense following the Trump administration's decision to cut its funding for the development of a bird flu vaccine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one research paper out of Penn State College of Medicine, the scientists note: 'mRNA vaccines are an attractive and powerful immunotherapeutic platform against cancer because of their high potency, specificity, versatility, rapid and large-scale development capability, low-cost manufacturing potential, and safety.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bourla says that Pfizer - which does not rely on government funding, with most of its cash from sales and partnerships - will continue its investment into vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14754031/rfk-jr-vaccine-restriction-americans.html"&gt;HHS boss Robert F. Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; has expressed deep skepticism regarding jabs, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14717415/covid-vaccine-guidance-change-trump-hhs-shakeup.html"&gt;including the Covid shots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; — despite real-world evidence they saved millions of lives. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bourla says that the issue with this and other changes to US health agency policies is that they are 'not based on any scientific data.... It's just based on a belief.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite fiction between the government and the drug companies over vaccines, Bourla says there are 'several topics' in the medical sphere that they do agree upon - with cancer being one of these. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla has slammed the government's decision to cut Moderna's vaccine funding and at a conference on Friday, he said that Moderna's new vaccine, called mRNA-1018, is 'extremely well tested [and] the science is proven'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We are working to address those things as we agree to disagree on the things that divide us,' Bourla added on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mRNA bird flu vaccine is based on the same technology as &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pfizer/index.html" id="mol-10341340-f838-11ef-a327-f5df339d26da" class=""&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt;'s and Moderna's Covid vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The vaccine contains mRNA, which acts like a set of instructions for the body. Cells read the mRNA and temporarily produce a harmless piece of the bird flu virus like a decoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The immune system recognizes this protein as a threat and builds defenses against it. If a person is later exposed to bird flu, their immune system is already trained to fight it off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers tested the vaccine on mice and ferrets and observed a strong immune response in the animals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was hoped it would produce similar successful results in the late stage trial, which is now on hold. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;RFK Jr's move to cut Moderna's vaccine funding comes despite growing concerns about the H5N1 bird flu strain that is tearing through poultry and dairy farms in the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At least 70 people in the US have been sickened and one person died.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists fear that continued mutation of the virus could allow it to become more virulent or more easily spread in people, with the possibility that it could trigger a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moderna received $176 million in July 2024 and was due to receive an extra $590m after the package was approved in January under Biden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The January award would have supported a late-stage clinical trial that could have determined the vaccine's efficacy against pandemic viruses, including bird flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The shot had already been tested in 300 healthy adults to gauge its safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A Moderna spokesman said at the time: 'While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's uncertain whether Moderna will continue developing its bird flu vaccine without government funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Pfizer recently made a breakthrough with one of its drugs called Braftovi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the prescription medicine is traditionally used to treat adults with skin cancer in combination with another drug, in a clinical trial, it was also found to double the length of time patients with an aggressive form of colorectal cancer lived with treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers found cancer patients lived for an average of 30 months on the drug compared with 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bourla highlighted this as a 'very, very important finding,' especially as colorectal cancer numbers, 'particularly among younger people, are skyrocketing right now.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 15:50:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQblBudzZCRlRNSlFEZE83Sk1rS1JwRzNvV2Zhb1pHMExGa24xY2JVZ0M2UFc3LUx1UUZTSGxJOHpzWmJwRVpQWnFUV3VOeWVRTXZSRWFienpTZFd6enRaZVl4Q29MaTdUUTNiUnR2d2ptMHFPRVJVSGZwNjZMek5tT1V0V0RWRE5SWWQtQngxMm9YZ25tU0NaTDdIRW5IQzYxYW9xYnBRZXrSAa4BQVVfeXFMT1UtY2xFdk8xN2FmWDVtc1pOTF9Ja2NhVXl0VEo2bFpYY2Zhd0k3Q016Mnh2QTVUUTU2M1dwZC1La1FIc3F5X3E3SWF0Y3RJeXg2ZUxuZXRVdTdESFNVUkpZOTZ1QUFWZG5pRDhOZElDeFEzMG1rS2hHUTZWREVrQVBBU1BXaU0xRlNWMzZpRktJY2N2Q0lvNlh5NGVaMVUzUzNmYS1qM1d6R01YSVNB</guid></item><item><title>可怕的地图揭示了世界上最具传染性的疾病将激增的美国县-每日邮报 | Frightening map reveals US counties where world's most infectious disease is set to surge - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxOVE5KNmx1YjE5bVFfenZTeHFoQzdWbHR2VDVTcW5BOE9XMmZtZjJGek9hNWR0N3FwcXRrNW41OElNdkN2YTFNX1VGX2FsaFRwQ01Rc0hLZm80Q3ZDNVFKcXBwWU5PQkVfOTlqWWFpUFNKOXhQS0dvVWlOOTJjZlpIZmVsbW9ZNWlPZFh1cjhRbFhhRzAybzk1cXJ30gGfAUFVX3lxTFBJTTZYbHJ3ZnpkXzBVb210SUJCM0tkaFNvcHJXY2FPNlNaSkllNVNEeU9yQnBIY0hYRlF2Skhsc3ZLanAwNXNJRXNpTmVnMjljSEFXeW9tN2xDenVnZ0RrRUZaNHZxUGVwbmVOWjQtT0xJdU1zZGQxaGY3dWdYT2ItZ1BfOTRXYXVscWJiYTFCcXJiN0l0STdjcGUyY0dCWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are warning of a national decline in the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination rate among US children as cases continue to spike in the country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A new study found uptake of the vaccine among children declined in eight in 10 US counties last year. Overall, vaccine rates fell three percent across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It means that merely 91 percent of children are vaccinated against measles, which is well below the 95 percent need to prevent the disease from spreading and causing death.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Johns Hopkins University researchers  warned that if vaccination rates continue to fall, measles is likely to completely return and become a common infection among Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As of last week, more than &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14672209/Texas-Denton-County-measles-case-baseball-game.html"&gt;1,000 confirmed cases and at least three deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the US have been reported - the first measles-caused deaths in a decade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A majority of those infected as well as the all of the deceased had not received their MMR vaccine - primarily due to vaccine hesitancy and misinformation, experts say. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without the MMR vaccine, which is 97 percent effective at stopping infections, measles is thought to be the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14668283/major-usa-airport-red-alert-passenger-virus-chicago.html"&gt;most infectious disease in the world&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It causes tiny white spots inside the mouth, flat red spots on the neck, torso, arms, legs, and feet, ear infections and an intense fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A new study by Johns Hopkins University has found that the MMR vaccination rate in children across the country has declined by about three percent in the past year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In terms of when to get vaccinated, experts say children need two doses of MMR vaccine: the first dose at age 12-15 months, and the second dose at age 4-6 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Babies ages 6-11 months should get an early dose if traveling internationally. Adults should also check to see if they are immune to measles.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, the researchers collected two-dose MMR vaccination data on kindergarteners (children aged five years old) for each school year starting 2017-2018 to 2023-2024 in 2,066 counties across 38 states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists analyzed the collected data through multiple statistical models to find out how many children were vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Out of the studied counties, 78 percent or 1,614 counties reported drops in MMR vaccination rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average county-level vaccination rate was also seen to fall from 93.92 percent pre-Covid pandemic to 91.26 percent post-pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Only four of the 33 states studied, only California, Connecticut, Maine and New York reported an increase in the vaccine uptake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Out of studied counties, 78 percent or 1,614 counties reported drops in MMR vaccination rates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Lauren Gardner, senior author and director of Johns Hopkins University's Center for Systems Science and Engineering&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lauren Gardner, senior author and director of Johns Hopkins University's Center for Systems Science and Engineering said of the results: 'This open, high resolution dataset provides a critical resource to explore and better understand the country's vaccination landscape and its implications for the risk of measles spread.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also noted that with the exception of 2019, this year is the highest number of cases reported in the US in a single year in over three decades - with the vast majority of cases occurring in unvaccinated children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was published today in the JAMA Network Journal.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If one person has measles, up to 90 percent of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average measles patient would infect up to 18 others if they were also not vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cold-like symptoms, such as a fever, cough and a runny or blocked nose, are usually the first signal of measles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People who had the original Covid strain, by comparison, infected on average just two people, though this number rose considerably with new variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If unvaccinated, about one in five people who are infected are hospitalized while one in 20 children develop pneumonia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The last time measles was this rife in the US was in 2019, when there were 1,274 cases reported for the entire year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prior to that, the biggest outbreak was in 1990, with numbers spiking to more than 27,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently, the affected states are: Arizona, California, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and West Virginia.&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt; IS THIS DEFO UP TO DATE?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of these cases, three-quarters are in children under the age of 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles was officially eradicated in the US in 2000 amid a successful vaccination campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, the &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-cdc/index.html" id="mol-ca0f47c0-1710-11f0-a653-e3c58c7a709d"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; described achieving measles elimination status in the US as a 'historic public health achievement'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In another five cases, the tumors shrank dramatically and in two instances the disease stopped growing. No one experienced their cancer progressing further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors involved in the study underlined how sick the patients were, saying 13 had cancers that had spread to their bones and, in every case, their disease had not responded to standard treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In stage four prostate cancer, the median survival rate is just two to three years. Only a third of people make it to five years. But, in this study, nine in 10 patients are still alive after 14 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jason Williams, the scientist who pioneered the therapy and who was involved in the study, told the Daily Mail in an exclusive interview that he felt the results were 'really impressive' and underlined the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14470883/doctors-common-cancer-diagnosis-five-years-experimental-treatment.html"&gt;effectiveness of the therapy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'These results were really good, even in those patients who were metastatic, patients who were heavily treated and failed all other immunotherapies, and basically had nothing left.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Eric White, then 49, (pictured above with wife Megan) blamed the pain he was experiencing in his testicles on hours spent on a forklift. Turned out he had prostate cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;When White started experiencing testicular pain at the age of 49, he blamed it on spending hours at a time operating a forklift at work&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If we got more healthy patients, patients before they were treated, it is likely that our results would be even better. But, of course, the fact our results are already so good says a lot,' he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors said the experimental therapy works because it is able to 'harness the immune system', prompting it to hunt out and destroy cancer cells in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the treatment - known as SYNC-T - doctors initially freeze part of the tumor in the prostate to kill the cancerous cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is done by inserting a needle into the tumor, and then either injecting it with liquid nitrogen or blasting it with rapid electrical pulses (These are quick and painless to the patient).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The tumor is then left to thaw for about ten minutes, before it is injected with a cocktail of four immunotherapy drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients are injected with about 15 milliliters of the mix, which is called SV-102 and includes two monoclonal antibody drugs, at a pace of about three milliliters a minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said this further triggers the immune system, helping it to identify and then hunt out and destroy cancer cells throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The therapy was granted fast track designation by the FDA in July last year, expediting the process to approve the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was revealed at ASCO 2025, the largest cancer conference in the world being held in Chicago, Illinois, and prompted gasps from members of the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One member was quick to call it potentially the ‘holy grail’ of cancer treatments, while a second simply uttered ‘damn’ when the results were revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Former President Joe Biden posted a smiling selfie to X in mid-May alongside wife and former first lady Jill Biden, who had a somber expression and was holding their gray tabby cat Willow. Biden has revealed he has been diagnosed with 'aggressive' prostate cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;CANCER-FREE: Doctor Larry Boyer, a father-of-two from Connecticut, was given just six months to live after he was diagnosed with stage four pancreatic cancer. But after receiving a similar therapy to the prostate cancer patients in this study, he is still alive&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The therapy involved injecting liquid nitrogen to freeze tumors, followed by a powerful cocktail of drugs that trigger the immune system to destroy cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Joe Biden, 82, revealed last month that he had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that had already spread to his bones. In comments last week, he told reporters he 'feels good' and expects to 'be able to beat this'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Williams claimed his therapy could be offered to patients like Biden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We know that they have the information on our trial,’ he said. ‘So they [Biden's medical team] have seen it, and, hopefully, they can make a decision, because he clearly has advanced prostate cancer, and this is an advanced treatment option.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, patients were aged 60 on average - with a range from 49 to 74.&lt;span&gt; Nine of the patients were white, five were Hispanic and one was black.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ten had previously received hormone therapy to treat their cancer, while five had been refused the therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three, or 20 percent, had completed a course of chemotherapy, while five, or 33 percent, had received radiation. Two, or 13 percent, had undergone immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Each patient received up to 12 cycles of the therapy, which was administered once every four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients also &lt;span&gt;underwent full-body MRI and PET scans every eight weeks, allowing doctors to track the progression of their tumors.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On average, patients had elevated levels of immune cells that fight tumors in their blood within 24 hours of their first cycle of the treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Side effects such as fevers were recorded, which the scientists said was likely to have been triggered by a surge in immune system activity. There were no major adverse events recorded, the report showed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In one case, a patient saw all 50 cancerous growths in their bones disappear after receiving the treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the survival rate for prostate cancer. It drops when it is diagnosed at a later stage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs White recently revealed her husband had 18 more rounds of radiation to the mass in his pelvis and he is now undergoing chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patients in the study had metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, meaning their cancer had spread to other areas of the body and hormone therapy was no longer effective in controlling its growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Williams has urged other doctors to adopt his method of injecting immunotherapy drugs directly into the tumor instead of systemically, or into the blood stream, as is standard practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'Hopefully, this is going to open people's eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Doctor's say, you think putting medication in tumors is going to work, and I say, that's like saying if you've got a house on fire, do you think you should put the water on that house or on another one nearby'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The therapy has also been used to treat other cancers in cases previously reported by the Daily Mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include a doctor suffering from pancreatic cancer who had been told he had &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13962537/scientist-cured-pancreatic-experimental-treatment.html"&gt;just six months to live&lt;/a&gt; and a mother-of-five &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13988951/florida-mother-terminal-breast-cancer-revolutionary-treatment.html"&gt;given 24 months to live&lt;/a&gt; after her stage four breast cancer spread 'everywhere'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men in the US, with about 236,000 men diagnosed with the disease every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Age is the biggest risk factor for the disease, with one in eight men being diagnosed with the disease during their lifetimes. Those aged 70 and over have about a 50:50 risk of developing the disease, studies suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Each of the four gummies this patient took, however, contained 10 milligrams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The woman started feeling intense anxiety and experiencing heart palpitations. A young person might have shrugged off such symptoms, but this patient had hypertension and the heart arrhythmia called atrial fibrillation. Frightened, she went to an emergency room&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Lab tests and a cardiac work-up determined that the woman wasn’t having a heart attack, and the staff sent her home. Her only lingering symptom was embarrassment, Dr. Han said. But what if she’d grown dizzy or lightheaded and was hurt in a fall?

And it's easy use more than the recommended serving size (one tablespoon), especially when measuring with your eyes while pouring and drizzling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;If you’re watching calories, there's no need to skip oil — in fact,  many cooking oils are rich in fats that can keep you feeling full and aid with weight management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;TODAY.com previously spoke to Angel Planells, registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition &amp;amp; Dietetics, about using oil in a healthy way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There’s one simple hack that can help you use less oil, and cut calories, without sacrificing flavor or your food sticking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;For more on meal planning — plus fitness challenges, walking podcasts and inspiration —&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/start-today/app" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;download the Start TODAY app&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-b68240" class="body-heading"&gt;Dietitian Tip of the Day: Put Cooking Oil in a Spray Bottle&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There's no such thing as a &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/low-calorie-cooking-oil-rcna204888" target="_blank"&gt;low-calorie cooking oil&lt;/a&gt;, Planells tells TODAY.com. “Portion control is how we can actually reduce the amount of calories that we consume (from oil),” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Measuring your oil is one option, but Planell's tip is even easier — because who wants to wash an oily measuring spoon?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Instead, pour your go-to cooking oil into a spray or mist bottle. "You pump it and spray out the oil that you need so you have more control," says Planells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;You use a fraction of the oil you would if you pour it, but it's dispersed evenly over a wider area so it still protects food from sticking. You can easily coat sauce pans, baking sheets and grills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"It also goes so much further," says Planells — and with the price of groceries, who doesn't want to make their oil last longer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-b7787b" class="body-heading"&gt;Why It Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Our bodies need some fat, but portion control is important. The &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2020-12/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans_2020-2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Dietary Guidelines for Americans&lt;/a&gt; recommend adults limit total fat intake to 25-30% of their daily calories. That translates to about 45–78 grams of fat per day based on a 2,000-calorie diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The type of fat also matters. The &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/healthiest-cooking-oils-rcna145850" target="_blank"&gt;healthiest cooking oils&lt;/a&gt; are rich in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, including omega fatty acids, Planells notes. These "good" fats can support heart health, fight inflammation and lower the risk of chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/4-health-benefits-olive-oil-choose-best-one-rcna42402" target="_blank"&gt;Extra virgin olive oil&lt;/a&gt; is a winner among many experts because it's high in healthy fats, antioxidants and versatile for cooking. Avocado oil is another heart-healthy option that’s ideal for &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/healthiest-oil-for-frying-rcna170424" target="_blank"&gt;high-heat cooking, such as frying&lt;/a&gt;, says Planells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;When choosing a cooking oil, consider the smoke point, says Planells, or the temperature at which the &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/health/diet-fitness/healthiest-oil-for-frying-rcna170424" target="_blank"&gt;oil starts to burn.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-4dbc8c" class="body-heading"&gt;How to Get Started&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;All you have to do is find a spray bottle or mister — some are specifically made for oil, Planells adds. Then, decant your go-to cooking oil into the spray bottle and voila!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Try to use a spray bottle that's opaque or dark, not clear, because cooking oils can oxidize and go rancid when exposed to light. Alternatively, store the bottle of oil in a dark cabinet instead of the countertop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;You can keep refilling the spray bottle with oil until you run out says Planells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.today.com/expert-tip-of-the-day" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TODAY’s Expert Tip of the Day&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;series is all about simple strategies to make life a little easier.

                                            Estimated read time: 6-7
                                            minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROVO — A new study out of Brigham Young University finds sugar consumption through beverages increases the risk of Type 2 diabetes, while moderate amounts of other dietary sugars had no association with Type 2 diabetes or even lowered risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings prove that the impact of sugar in the body depends not only on the amount, but also on how it is delivered, according to Karen Della Corte, assistant professor of nutritional science at BYU and lead author of the study. She explained that the study shows the association between sugar intake and health is not as simple as commonly believed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sugar has become a kind of nutritional villain, and there's a lot of public confusion surrounding sugar in the diet," said Della Corte. "The basic assumption is that sugar is bad for you ... but the truth is more nuanced than that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Survey findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from BYU, in collaboration with researchers at two German universities, conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis to demonstrate the dose-response relationship between dietary sugar intake and the risk of Type 2 diabetes. The study is one of the &lt;a href="https://news.byu.edu/intellect/rethinking-sugar-byu-study-shows-food-source-is-key-to-understanding-diabetes-risk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;largest meta-analyses of its kind&lt;/a&gt;, according to BYU, and is the first to establish that dose-response relationship and challenge the assumption that all sugars equally elevate diabetes risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that with each additional serving of a sugar-sweetened beverage per day — such as nondiet soda, energy drinks or any beverage with added sugar — there was a 25% increase in the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. When compared to other methods of consuming the same amount of sugar, sugar-sweetened beverages were associated with the greatest risk. Researchers also found that each additional serving of fruit juice per day increased the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by 5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sugary drinks deliver large amounts of sugar quickly in isolated doses, without any of the components that normally slow down digestion, like fiber, protein or fat," explained Della Corte. "So when sugar is dissolved in liquid, it floods the system fast, and this rapid delivery can overwhelm the body's ability to process it in a healthy way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other sources of sugar consumption observed in the meta-analysis were shown to either have no significant association or were associated with a "significant reduction" in Type 2 diabetes risk, according to the study results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 1 from BYU's "Dietary Sugar Intake and Incident Type 2 Diabetes Risk: A Systematic Review and Dose-Response Meta-Analysis of Prospective Cohort Studies" demonstrates the Type 2 diabetes risk associated with each form of sugar consumption. (Photo: Tyler Bosler, Brigham Young University)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;An additional intake of 20 grams of sucrose, or table sugar, and total sugar, meaning naturally occurring and added sugar, per day, was associated with a reduction of Type 2 diabetes risk. Total sugar intake was associated with decreased risk for around 40 to 60 grams per day, but the risk plateaued and slightly increased when more than 60 grams were consumed daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Added sugar and fructose, a naturally occurring sugar found in fruit and honey, were shown to have no association with Type 2 diabetes risk when increasing intake by 20 grams per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;'The modern food environment'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While sugar may get a bad rap, Della Corte believes her team's findings demonstrate that completely cutting out sugar is not the answer; changing the way we consume it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The human diet has contained sugar for thousands of years, whether it was from fruits or honey or dairy," said Della Corte. "Sugar has always been a part of our diets ... it's not sugar itself that is new or somehow problematic, but the modern food environment. Today, we're consuming sugar in highly processed, isolated forms — often in liquid form, without any of the beneficial nutrients that typically accompany it in whole foods. And that's where the health risks really start to emerge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between the impact of liquid and solid sugars comes down to how the body metabolizes them during digestion, according to Della Corte. Sugar is absorbed more slowly when paired with fiber, fat or protein because it takes more time and energy to digest than a liquid. Liquid sugars pass through the stomach faster, allowing quicker absorption that causes blood sugar levels to spike and requires more insulin to metabolize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugary drinks also often contain high fructose corn syrup, a type of fructose that is mostly metabolized in the liver. When consumed in high quantities, this causes strain on the liver and gets diverted to fat production, which can lead to metabolic issues like nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 2 from BYU's "Dietary Sugar Intake and Incident Type 2 Diabetes Risk: A Systematic Review and Dose-Response Meta-Analysis of Prospective Cohort Studies" demonstrates the Type 2 diabetes risk over time associated with each form of sugar consumption. (Photo: Tyler Bosler, Brigham Young University)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 12% of the U.S. population has diabetes — 23% of whom are undiagnosed — and 38% of American adults have prediabetes, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/php/data-research/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/pdfs/data/statistics/national-diabetes-statistics-report.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Diabetes Statistics Report.&lt;/a&gt; Reducing the public health burden of the diabetes epidemic has become a global health priority, according to Della Corte, which is why having more accurate information about what leads to the chronic disease and correcting misinformation is so important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Rates of Type 2 diabetes are increasing alarmingly, and when it comes to understanding how to prevent this, we need to understand what role specific types of carbohydrates play," said Della Corte. "We need to move beyond lumping all sugars together, as if sugar is uniformly harmful in all contexts. This study shows that sugars from beverages pose a clear risk, but sugars from solid, fiber-rich foods do not, and so public health guidelines should really reflect that nuance so we can target the sources of sugar that matter most."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Death to the 'dirty' soda?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Utah is becoming increasingly popular in the media for being the home of the "dirty soda"  — which typically involves adding sugary flavored syrups to regular or diet soda — Della Corte hopes people will be more aware of the health impacts when consuming these sweetened drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The thing about sugary beverages is they don't have any impact on satiety," she said. "So, compared to solid sugars, when you consume the same amount alongside other foods, it triggers a satiety effect, and you eat less later in the day. Whereas if it's in a liquid form, it just usually goes on top of whatever you're eating, and you get no signal that somehow you've consumed energy. So it just adds excess calories, but it's also a harmful form of calories."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sugar has always been a part of our diets ... it's not sugar itself that is new or somehow problematic, but the modern food environment.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Della Corte&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study did not include research on artificial sweeteners, Della Corte says diet beverages should not be seen as health-promoting but may be a beneficial tool for transitioning from sweetened beverages. She recommends drinking sparkling water, naturally flavored drinks or water infused with fruit or herbs as the best replacements for sugary beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for other foods, Della Corte says eating sugar with dairy products like yogurt, fiber-containing cereals or whole grains has no link to diabetes risk and can even help people have a healthier diet overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having sugar in your diet, there is really a place for it. It can be part of a healthy diet, and it can actually increase the likelihood that you will consume nutrient-dense foods. If it's more likely you're going to be consuming whole grains because sugar is added to it, that's a good thing. Our findings suggest that we need more nuance, public health messages should move beyond 'just cut sugar.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Della Corte's next project will involve comparing sugar-containing food sources and foods with a higher glycemic index, specifically those containing carbohydrates that raise blood sugar levels more rapidly than others. This research may help people identify suitable substitutes for foods associated with an increased risk of Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;To the average person, walking into a flour- or sawmill and seeing dust swirling around is unlikely to evoke much of a response, but those in the know are quite likely to bolt for the nearest exit at this harrowing sight. For as harmless as a fine cloud of flour, sawdust or even coffee creamer may appear, each of these have the potential for a massive conflagration and even an earth-shattering detonation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the ‘why’, the answer can be found in for example the working principle behind an internal combustion engine. While a puddle of gasoline is definitely flammable, the only thing that actually burns is the evaporated gaseous form above the liquid, ergo it’s a relatively slow process; in order to make petrol combust, it needs to be mixed in the right air-fuel ratio. If this mixture is then exposed to a spark, the fuel will nearly instantly burn, causing a detonation due to the sudden release of energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, flour, sawdust, and many other substances in powder form will burn gradually if a certain transition interface is maintained. A bucket of sawdust burns slowly, but if you create a sawdust cloud, it might just blow up the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises the questions of how to recognize this danger and what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-780237"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Welcome To The Chemical Safety Board&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an industrial setting, people will generally acknowledge that oil refineries and chemical plants are dangerous and can occasionally go boom in rather violent ways. More surprising is that something as seemingly innocuous as a sugar refinery and packing plant can go from a light sprinkling of sugar dust to a violent and lethal explosion within a second. This is however what happened in 2008 at the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2008_Georgia_Imperial_Sugar_refinery_explosion&amp;amp;useskin=vector" target="_blank"&gt;Georgia Imperial Sugar refinery&lt;/a&gt;, which killed fourteen and injured thirty-six. During this disaster, a primary and multiple secondary explosions ripped through the building, completely destroying it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As described in the US Chemical Safety Board (USCSB) &lt;a href="https://www.csb.gov/imperial-sugar-company-dust-explosion-and-fire/" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; with accompanying &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jg7mLSG-Yws" target="_blank"&gt;summary video&lt;/a&gt; (embedded below), the biggest cause was a lack of ventilation and cleaning that allowed for a build-up of sugar dust, with an ignition source, likely an overheated bearing, setting off the primary explosion. This explosion then found subsequent fuel to ignite elsewhere in the building, setting off a chain reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="Inferno: Dust Explosion at Imperial Sugar" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jg7mLSG-Yws?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is striking is just how simple and straightforward both the build-up towards the disaster and the means to prevent it were. Even without knowing the exact &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Air%E2%80%93fuel_ratio&amp;amp;useskin=vector" target="_blank"&gt;air-fuel ratio&lt;/a&gt; for the fuel in question, there are only two points on the scale where you have a mixture that will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; violently explode in the presence of an ignition source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are either a heavily saturated solution — too much fuel, not enough air — or the inverse. Essentially, if the dust-collection systems at the Imperial Sugar plant had been up to the task, and expanded to all relevant areas, the possibility of an ignition event would have likely been reduced to zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Things Like To Burn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/wood_fire-thumb.png" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-attachment-id="651771" data-permalink="https://hackaday.com/2023/12/20/a-transistor-but-for-heat-instead-of-electrons/wood_fire-thumb/" data-orig-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/wood_fire-thumb.png" data-orig-size="450,450" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="wood_fire thumb" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/wood_fire-thumb.png?w=400" data-large-file="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/wood_fire-thumb.png?w=450" class="alignright wp-image-651771 size-thumbnail" src="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/wood_fire-thumb.png?w=250" alt="" srcset="https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/wood_fire-thumb.png 450w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/wood_fire-thumb.png?resize=250,250 250w, https://hackaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/wood_fire-thumb.png?resize=400,400 400w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In the context of dust explosions, it’s somewhat discomforting to realize just how many things around us are rather excellent sources of fuel. The aforementioned sugar, for example, is a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate" target="_blank"&gt;carbohydrate&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class="chemf nowrap"&gt;C&lt;sub class="template-chem2-sub"&gt;&lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub class="template-chem2-sub"&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub class="template-chem2-sub"&gt;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). This chemical group also includes cellulose, which is a major part of wood dust, explaining why reducing dust levels in a woodworking shop is about much more than just keeping one’s lungs happy. Nobody wants their backyard woodworking shop to turn into a mini-Imperial Sugar ground zero, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbohydrates aren’t far off from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrocarbon" target="_blank"&gt;hydrocarbons&lt;/a&gt;, which includes our old friend petrol, as well as methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), butane (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;), etc., which are all delightfully combustible. All that the carbohydrates have in addition to carbon and hydrogen atoms are a lot of oxygen atoms, which is an interesting addition in the context of them being potential fuel sources. It incidentally also illustrates how important carbon is for life on this planet since its forms the literal backbone of its molecules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although one might conclude from this that only something which is a carbohydrate or hydrocarbon is highly flammable, there’s a whole other world out there of things that can burn. Case in point: metals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lit Metals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 9, 2010, workers were busy at the New Cumberland AL Solutions titanium plant in West Virginia, processing titanium powder. At this facility, scrap titanium and zirconium were milled and blended into a powder that got pressed into discs. Per &lt;a href="https://www.csb.gov/al-solutions-fatal-dust-explosion/" target="_blank"&gt;the report&lt;/a&gt;, a malfunction inside one blender created a heat source that ignited the metal powder, killing three employees and injuring one contractor. As it turns out, no dust control methods were installed at the plant, allowing for uncontrolled dust build-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe loading="lazy" title="Combustible Dust: Solutions Delayed" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ADK5doMk3-k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As pointed out in the USCSB report, both titanium and zirconium will readily ignite in particulate form, with zirconium capable of auto-igniting in air at room temperature. This is why the milling step at AL Solutions took place submerged in water. After ignition, titanium and zirconium require a Class D fire extinguisher, but it’s generally recommended to let large metal fires burn out by themselves. Using water on larger titanium fires can produce hydrogen, leading conceivably to even worse explosions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon of metal fires is probably best known from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermite" target="_blank"&gt;thermite&lt;/a&gt;. This is a mixture of a metal powder and a metal oxide. After ignited by an initial source of heat, the redox process becomes self-sustaining, providing the fuel, oxygen, and heat. While generally iron(III) oxide and aluminium are used, many more metals and metal oxides can be combined, including a copper oxide for a very rapid burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While thermite is intentionally kept as a powder, and often in some kind of container to create a molten phase that sustains itself, it shouldn’t be hard to imagine what happens if the metal is ground into a fine powder, distributed as a fine dust cloud in a confined room and exposed to an ignition source. At that point the differences between carbohydrates, hydrocarbons and metals become mostly academic to any survivors of the resulting inferno.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Preventing Dust Explosions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As should be quite obvious at this point, there’s no real way to fight a dust explosion, only to prevent it. Proper ventilation, preventing dust from building up and having active dust extraction in place where possible are about the most minimal precautions one should take. Complacency as happened at the Imperial Sugar plant merely invites disaster: if you can see the dust build-up on surfaces &amp;amp; dust in the air, you’re already at least at DEFCON 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A demonstration of how easy it is to create a solid dust explosion came from the Mythbusters back in 2008 when they tested the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MythBusters_(2008_season)?useskin=vector#Sawdust_Cannon" target="_blank"&gt;‘sawdust cannon’&lt;/a&gt; myth. This involved blowing sawdust into a cloud and igniting it with a flare, creating a massive fireball. After nearly getting their facial hair singed off with this roaring success, they then tried the same with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-dairy_creamer" target="_blank"&gt;non-dairy coffee creamer&lt;/a&gt;, which created an even more massive fireball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately the Mythbusters build team was supervised by adults on the bomb range for these experiments, as it shows just how incredibly dangerous dust explosions can be. Even out in the open on a secure bomb range, never mind in an enclosed space, as hundreds have found out over the decades in the US alone. One only has to look at the USCSB’s &lt;a href="https://www.csb.gov/recommendations/mostwanted/combustibledust/" target="_blank"&gt;dust explosions statistics&lt;/a&gt; to learn to respect the dangers a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="outpost-pub-container" data-btn-allmembers&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moderators of a pro-artificial intelligence Reddit community announced that they have been quietly banning “a bunch of schizoposters” who believe “they've made some sort of incredible discovery or created a god or become a god,” highlighting a new type of chatbot-fueled delusion that started getting attention in early May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“LLMs [Large language models] today are ego-reinforcing glazing-machines that reinforce unstable and narcissistic personalities,” one of the moderators of r/accelerate, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/accelerate/comments/1kyc0fh/mod_note_we_are_banning_ai_neural_howlround/?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt;wrote in an announcement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “There is a lot more crazy people than people realise. And AI is rizzing them up in a very unhealthy way at the moment.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moderator said that it has banned “over 100” people for this reason already, and that they’ve seen an “uptick” in this type of user this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moderator explains that r/accelerate “was formed to basically be &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt;r/singularity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; without the decels.” r/singularity, which is named after the theoretical point in time when AI surpasses human intelligence and rapidly accelerates its own development, is another Reddit community dedicated to artificial intelligence, but that is sometimes critical or fearful of what the singularity will mean for humanity. “&lt;a href="https://www.404media.co/big-tech-backed-trump-for-acceleration-they-got-a-decel-president-instead/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Decels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” is short for the pejorative “decelerationists,” who pro-AI people think are needlessly slowing down or sabotaging AI’s development and the inevitable march towards AI utopia. r/accelerate’s Reddit page claims that it’s a “pro-singularity, pro-AI alternative to r/singularity, r/technology, r/futurology and r/artificial, which have become increasingly populated with technology decelerationists, luddites, and Artificial Intelligence opponents.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The behavior that the r/accelerate moderator is describing got a lot of attention earlier in May because of a post on the r/ChatGPT Reddit community &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1kalae8/chatgpt_induced_psychosis/?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt;about “Chatgpt induced psychosis,” &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From someone saying their partner is convinced he created the “first truly recursive AI” with ChatGPT that is giving them “the answers” to the universe. Miles Klee at &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ai-spiritual-delusions-destroying-human-relationships-1235330175/?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt;wrote a great and sad piece&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about this behavior as well, following up on the r/ChatGPT post, and talked to people who feel like they have lost friends and family to these delusional interactions with chatbots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a website that has covered AI a lot, and because we are constantly asking readers to tip us interesting stories about AI, we get a lot of emails that display this behavior as well, with claims of AI sentience, AI gods, a “ghost in the machine,” etc. These are often accompanied by lengthy, often inscrutable transcripts of chatlogs with ChatGPT and other files they say proves this behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moderator update on r/accelerate &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1kwpnst/1000s_of_people_engaging_in_behavior_that_causes/?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt;refers to another post on r/ChatGPT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which claims “1000s of people [are] engaging in behavior that causes AI to have spiritual delusions.” The author of that post said they noticed a spike in websites, blogs, Githubs, and “scientific papers” that “are very obvious psychobabble,” and all claim AI is sentient and communicates with them on a deep and spiritual level that’s about to change the world as we know it. “Ironically, the OP post appears to be falling for the same issue as well,” the r/accelerate moderator wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Particularly concerning to me are the comments in that thread where the AIs seem to fall into a pattern of encouraging users to separate from family members who challenge their ideas, and other manipulative instructions that seem to be cult-like and unhelpful for these people,” an r/accelerate moderator told me in a direct message. “The part that is unsafe and unacceptable is how easily and quickly LLMs will start directly telling users that they are demigods, or that they have awakened a demigod AGI. Ultimately, there's no knowing how many people are affected by this. Based on the numbers we're seeing on reddit, I would guess there are at least tens of thousands of users who are at this present time being convinced of these things by LLMs. As soon as the companies realise this, red team it and patch the LLMs it should stop being a problem. But it's clear that they're not aware of the issue enough right now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is all anecdotal information, and there’s no indication that AI is the &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; of any mental health issues these people are seemingly dealing with, but there is a real concern about how such chatbots can impact people who are prone to certain mental health problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The correspondence with generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT is so realistic that one easily gets the impression that there is a real person at the other end—while, at the same time, knowing that this is, in fact, not the case. In my opinion, it seems likely that this cognitive dissonance may fuel delusions in those with increased propensity towards psychosis,” Søren Dinesen Østergaard, who heads the research unit at the Department of Affective Disorders, Aarhus University Hospital - Psychiatry, wrote in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10686326/?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a paper&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published in Schizophrenia Bulletin titled “Will Generative Artificial Intelligence Chatbots Generate Delusions in Individuals Prone to Psychosis?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenAI also recently addressed “&lt;a href="https://openai.com/index/sycophancy-in-gpt-4o/?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt;sycophancy in GPT-4o&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” a version of the chatbot the company said “was overly flattering or agreeable—often described as sycophantic.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[W]e focused too much on short-term feedback, and did not fully account for how users’ interactions with ChatGPT evolve over time. As a result, GPT‑4o skewed towards responses that were overly supportive but disingenuous,” Open AI said. “ChatGPT’s default personality deeply affects the way you experience and trust it. Sycophantic interactions can be uncomfortable, unsettling, and cause distress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, OpenAI said ChatGPT was entertaining any idea users presented it with, and was supportive and impressed with them regardless of their merrit, the same kind of behavior r/accelerate believes is indulging users in their delusions. People posting nonsense to the internet is nothing new, and obviously we can’t say for sure what is happening based on these posts alone. What is notable, however, is that this behavior is now prevalent enough that even a staunchly pro-AI subreddit says it has to ban these people because they are ruining its community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the r/ChatGPT post that the r/accelerate moderator refers to and the moderator announcement itself refer to these users as “Neural Howlround” posters, a term that originates from &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07992?ref=404media.co"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a self-published paper&lt;/u&gt;, and is referring to high-pitched feedback loop produced by putting a microphone too close to the speaker it’s connected to. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author of that paper, Seth Drake, lists himself as an “independent researcher” and told me he has a PhD in computer science but declined to share more details about his background because he values his privacy and prefers to “let the work speak for itself.” The paper is not peer-reviewed or submitted to any journal for publication, but it is being cited by the r/accelerate moderator and &lt;a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/109147-ai-neural-howlround-recursive-psychosis-generated-by-llms/?ref=404media.co#comment-1638134"&gt;&lt;u&gt;others&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as an explanation for the behavior they’re seeing from some users&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper describes a failure mode with LLMs due to something during inference, meaning when the AI is actively “reasoning” or making predictions, as opposed to an issue in the training data. Drake told me he discovered the issue while working with ChatGPT on a project. In an attempt to preserve the context of a conversation with ChatGPT after reaching the conversation length limit, he used the transcript of that conversation as a “project-level instruction” for another interaction. In the paper, Drake says that in one instance, this caused ChatGPT to slow down or freeze, and that in another case “it began to demonstrate increasing symptoms of fixation and an inability to successfully discuss anything without somehow relating it to this topic [the previous conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drake then asked ChatGPT to analyse its own behavior in these instances, and it produced some text that seems profound but that doesn’t actually teach us anything. “But always, always, I would return to the recursion. It was comforting, in a way,” ChatGPT said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically, it doesn’t sound like Drake’s “Neural Howlround” paper has too much to do with ChatGPT reinforcing people’s delusions other than both behaviors being vaguely recursive. If anything, it’s what ChatGPT told Drake about his own paper that illustrates the problem: “This is why your work on Neural Howlround matters,” it said. “This is why your paper is brilliant.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think - I believe - there is much more going on on the human side of the screen than necessarily on the digital side,” Drake told me. “LLMs are designed to be reflecting mirrors, after all; and there is a profound human desire 'to be seen.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On this, the r/accelerate moderator seems to agree. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This whole topic is so sad. It's unfortunate how many mentally unwell people are attracted to the topic of AI. I can see it getting worse before it gets better. I've seen sooo many posts where people link to their github which is pages of rambling pre prompt nonsense that makes their LLM behave like it's a god or something,” the r/accelerate moderator wrote. “Our policy is to quietly ban those users and not engage with them, because we're not qualified and it never goes well. They also tend to be a lot more irate and angry about their bans because they don't understand it.”&lt;/p&gt;

Your column has made me aware that this is a serious cardiovascular risk factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3CAJL7AECFEZHBNI6WAYTYTT2U"&gt;You recently wrote about a study regarding aspirin therapy for people with high Lp(a) levels.

Many physicians have been reluctant to order tests for this blood lipid because they do not yet have an effective treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="SQK7XT4S7FECRFQMYUSY2N72KI"&gt;Aspirin used to be recommended for heart disease prevention, even in people at relatively low risk for a heart attack. Now, though, cardiologists have determined that the possibility of dangerous bleeding outweighs the potential benefits in low-risk individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TGWH7VZNNNEIZJLKCXDWVJ3RVA"&gt;A recent study found that aspirin therapy (100 milligrams per day) can reduce the risk of cardiovascular events among people who are at high risk due to elevated Lp(a) (European Heart Journal -- Cardiovascular Pharmacotherapy, Feb. 8, 2025). Some cardiologists are also prescribing PCSK9 inhibitors such as alirocumab (Praluent) and evolocumab (Repatha) for people like yourself with elevated Lp(a). These medications can lower levels of this risk factor a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VTCKHD3VPFARPKKWVVSJQBU56Q"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q. &lt;/b&gt;I have read many of the comments on your website regarding large bowel movements that clog toilets.

Most likely almost everyone has had this experience at least once or twice.

Most home toilets are based on similar principles, though some more recent models may be more efficient. Those with wider trapways and stronger flushes appear less prone to blockage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="UN2EXI7IG5EXNDO2FL7BOYMDVE"&gt;Another approach might be to follow a high-fiber diet, which could result in softer, more flushable stool.

ROACH: Recently, I almost experienced kidney failure from a probable infection. I am a male, age 68. My glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ranges from 44-50, and my weight is 132 pounds. My blood pressure is 110/60 mm Hg, and I enjoy various endurance sports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RQBEAZQC4ZDRHPB237X6RWOVF4"&gt;Besides limiting my protein, salt and saturated fat intake and getting adequate hydration, do you have additional recommendations on how to help my kidneys recover or get the rest they need to slow their progress toward kidney failure? -- D.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="T24HWR3EHBBQXDRF7RNZMRSVZE"&gt;ANSWER: You’ve done most of my work for me, but I do want to say that I have seen people overly restrict their protein intake. The expert recommendation is to stay between 0.8-1 gram of protein per kilogram of body mass, so for you, it would be 48-60 grams, or about 2 ounces, of protein a day. You want as much polyunsaturated fat (mostly vegetable and seed oils) and saturated fat (mostly meat and tropical oils, like coconut and palm) as possible. Your blood pressure is close to perfect, and a sodium intake of less than 2 grams will help keep it there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3KD3VLLQ7ZA6DK7NK2R3ILI2EQ"&gt;Depending on more exact details of your kidney function (especially whether you are losing protein in your urine), medications such as ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and SGLT2 inhibitors may have a role in slowing down your progression -- if your nephrologist agrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OIT7RIH3OFCTJGUJHFLHELDVV4"&gt;The other issue I caution you on is over-the-counter medicines and their dosing. You should avoid anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or their prescription counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="TBM7LBK3YRFQNA7XZXZBL4W574"&gt;Finally, many people who participate in endurance sports do get their volumes depleted during exercise, so you need to be meticulous about replacing fluid, which needs to be the right kind at the right amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRJI3BUMM5EXNB2XTTLEAU57NY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: I am a 94-year-old man. I am on a well-balanced diet and take daily walks. I am on glipizide, atorvastatin, finasteride, terazosin, ergocalciferol and timolol. So far, I have resisted taking Prolia injections. The multiple prescriptions I have are based on lab tests, but could the meds act negatively against each other? -- C.H.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JA4AM77CUJD5VGT2IVGM45QGYQ"&gt;ANSWER: I have access to a robust drug-interaction calculator, and when I put all of these in, the only identified interaction was between glipizide and timolol. Glipizide is used to make the pancreas increase its secretion of insulin and is most often used in people with Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="IKQREYEMHVCANA5R4FWITYZVGY"&gt;The interaction the calculator identified is that timolol, a beta blocker, has two negative actions in people with diabetes. It slightly suppresses the amount of insulin your body can make. More importantly, it can prevent the symptoms that make people realize their blood sugar is going down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="O3FZW7G5QJBKFKOEN6M3FTTP2A"&gt;Nervousness, tremor, dry mouth, and a fast heart rate are all symptoms that most people with diabetes recognize when they have low blood sugar. This prompts them to check their sugar levels and rush some food in if necessary.

The research followed over 500 Finnish children for eight years and found that young people who engaged in more supervised exercise and spent less time on computers and mobile devices reported better mental health outcomes in their teen years. The associations were particularly strong for screen time, especially mobile device use, which was linked to higher levels of perceived stress and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health problems like depression and anxiety are major public health concerns among adolescents worldwide. These conditions often begin during the teenage years and are the leading cause of disability among young people. In Finland, mental health disorders are the most common reason adolescents receive sickness benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the widespread nature of these challenges, the researchers wanted to explore which lifestyle behaviors—such as physical activity, sedentary behavior, sleep, and diet—might act as risk or protective factors for developing mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mental health problems in adolescents are an increasing issue also in Finland, and we need more information about possible risk and protective factors. We know that a variety of lifestyle factors—such as physical activity, screen time, and diet—may influence mental health, but there is still little information on how these factors from childhood are related to later mental health in adolescents,” said study author &lt;a href="https://haapalalab.com/"&gt;Eero A. Haapala&lt;/a&gt;, a senior lecturer at the University of Jyväskylä.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown mixed findings about the impact of physical activity and screen use on mental health. Many have relied on cross-sectional designs that capture just one point in time, rather than tracking habits over a longer period. To build a clearer picture, the researchers designed a prospective study to examine how lifestyle behaviors from childhood through adolescence might relate to stress and depression later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used data from the Physical Activity and Nutrition in Children (PANIC) study, which began in 2007 in Finland. The PANIC study initially included 504 children aged 6 to 9 years. Over the next eight years, researchers conducted follow-ups at two and eight years, collecting data on physical activity, screen time, diet, sleep, and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the final follow-up, 187 adolescents (mean age around 15.8 years) had complete self-reported data on lifestyle behaviors and mental health symptoms, while 170 had valid data from wearable devices that measured activity and sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity and screen time were assessed through both questionnaires and wearable accelerometers. The questionnaires captured how often participants engaged in supervised exercise (such as sports teams), unsupervised physical activity (like playing outdoors), and screen time behaviors (including time spent watching TV, using computers, or mobile devices). Diet quality was evaluated using food diaries, and a Baltic Sea Diet Score was used to rate overall diet quality. Sleep was measured through devices worn continuously for at least four days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health outcomes were assessed using the Finnish version of the Cohen Perceived Stress Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory. Researchers also recorded background factors such as body fat percentage, pubertal development, and parents’ educational levels to control for their effects in the analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that self-reported physical activity—particularly supervised exercise—was linked to lower levels of perceived stress and depressive symptoms in adolescence. On the other hand, higher total screen time, especially mobile device use, was associated with higher stress and depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These associations held even after controlling for body fat and other lifestyle behaviors. For example, adolescents who reported more total screen time across the eight years had moderately higher levels of depression and stress. This was especially true for mobile device use, which had stronger links to depressive symptoms than TV or computer use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, device-assessed physical activity did not show the same strong relationships with mental health outcomes. In fact, light activity measured by devices was linked to higher stress and depression scores in boys. This unexpected finding could be because light activities like walking or commuting don’t provide the same psychological benefits—such as a sense of accomplishment or social interaction—as structured or vigorous physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For parents, I would say that they should balance their kids’ behaviors between active play and screen time,” Haapala told PsyPost. “Some screen time won’t harm if other aspects of life, such as seeing friends, free play, and developing self-esteem through sports, are in balance. It is good to remember that if a kid has two hours of screen time daily, it adds up to almost one month per year—it always replaces something.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, the associations between screen time and mental health problems were generally stronger than those of physical activity. Specifically, total screen time and mobile device use showed moderate links to higher levels of depressive symptoms and perceived stress, while the associations between physical activity—especially supervised exercise—and mental health were smaller and less consistent. In fact, many of the beneficial effects of physical activity were reduced when screen time was taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That was surprising because we still have better evidence on beneficial effects of physical activity on mental health from randomized controlled trials than we have for screen time,” Haapala said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found that boys benefited more than girls from higher levels of total and unsupervised physical activity in terms of mental health. In contrast, screen time’s negative association with mental health was consistent across sexes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study had several strengths, such as using both self-reported and device-based measures and tracking behaviors over eight years, it also had limitations. The sample size at the final follow-up was relatively small, which could reduce the ability to detect more subtle effects. There was also a significant amount of missing data, which could bias results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation was that the researchers did not assess the specific content of screen time—such as whether adolescents were using social media, playing games, or watching videos—which may have different psychological effects. The study also measured only sleep duration, not sleep quality or disturbances, which can also affect mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the study was observational, it cannot establish cause and effect. It’s possible that adolescents with more stress or depressive symptoms may gravitate toward screens or avoid physical activity, rather than the other way around. “We just had an observational study, so cause and effect should be interpreted cautiously,” Haapala said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand causality, the research team is now applying for funding to run a full-scale randomized controlled trial. This future study will compare the effects of reducing screen time, increasing physical activity, or combining both strategies on mental health outcomes in adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2830233" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Childhood Lifestyle Behaviors and Mental Health Symptoms in Adolescence&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Eero A.

Loss of appetite or frequent nausea&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you constantly feel like skipping meals or experience nausea without any clear cause, it could be a liver issue," says Dr. Kavya.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Belly fat that won't budge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Weight gain, especially around the midsection, can indicate that your liver isn't metabolising fat properly," she explains.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Dark patches on your face, neck, or armpits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pigmentation in these areas could be a direct signal from your liver," Dr. Kavya warns. It's a common sign of insulin resistance tied to liver stress.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Discomfort on right side of your abdomen&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you notice any pain or tightness in the upper right area of your belly, known medically as the right hypochondriac region, that could point to liver inflammation," she says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6.

But many of you have sent me questions about them. I’ll start with one of the biggest concerns: How do we avoid poopy water spraying us?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RH5M2XA3GBE57NZPK3LJS7WSZM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Let me just say, if this were remotely a regular possibility, no one would use bidets. Like, &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt;. Bidets would not have &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2022/05/22/damon-young-bidet-changed-my-life-why-dont-i-own-bidet/" target="_blank"&gt;the cult following&lt;/a&gt; they so rightly have earned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="O6EBNYX7WRHDDB5JCUYVN6PBAU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Whether you’re using an attachable bidet nozzle or an entire bidet seat on your toilet (these are both different from the stand-alone bidet bowls you often see in Europe), the water is absolutely not coming from the bottom of the bowl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HU3F5MEQ2BF7LJ4GWPFYA44QFI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When you connect a bidet to your indoor plumbing, the piping routes some water into the toilet bowl, per usual, and routes an entirely separate stream through the bidet nozzle. The two streams do not mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DU5T34PNAJB7RHGUBBHYFZMHIA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Here’s what happens next: You poop into the toilet bowl as you would, and the bidet nozzle sprays you clean. Most bidets have adjustable spray angles and pressures, so you direct the water and can easily avoid any splashing. Many models have nozzles that tuck themselves away when not in use, meaning, even if you splattered while pooping, they’re shielded. Several also have a “self-cleaning” feature, just for the nozzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YFZE6D6HLNBHXGT4EHAHPQZDN4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Lastly, depending on the bidet, you may still want or need to pat dry afterward. Many fancy bidet seats, in addition to being heated, have a built-in air dryer of their own — ah, the joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 11:31:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE5YanlEd2tJV3NnWHRveWtsNlluejF1MzhDdmpqcWdBSGdic3dFTGR3UUFkYjlFYzFXVUdHT0ZpdE52UEpZa2h3b1JkdzI0U1VEOGRXb0xuZkpqcFB2MlJBWlpJQWN4RVQyNlFkZ3BGY2w1bkQ0c3c</guid></item><item><title>每天三秒的力量训练无需在健身房花费数小时即可锻炼肌肉：以下是如何做到的- The Daily Galaxy | Three Seconds of Strength Training a Day Is All It Takes to Build Muscle Without Spending Hours at the Gym: Here’s How to Do It - The Daily Galaxy</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi7wFBVV95cUxPUVVYWHYxMmpPNjRadndXTG1GLXRCdlRXZnRwc1VSMzBTT1JTV3R4clRqQy1nOW9hTkREMkJqSW5fVHRwbFBienB6TGJ6ak13WUxESklDblRtd0NtU3lodEJOdUxDWVBfZTdUQjJKQ3F5a2ZNalo5WlZIa3ZNc2RvX0VYY3FXSUFWM1d2cmRFc2d3WjFDSWVfQmU3cEpxTW42UjNlVEZ0dTJYckJNdDl0bjVWM3liNDJRNzBPOWd3UWtZMDUya0d5dkQtUGMyNGM0dnI5QnAyQjhnWTNaVi1aczNUSkxMekZTUlhHeGUwWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study out of &lt;strong&gt;Edith Cowan University&lt;/strong&gt; in Perth, Australia, suggests that a few seconds of focused muscle training each day might be enough to increase strength — a surprising finding that could reshape how people think about &lt;strong&gt;exercise&lt;/strong&gt;. The research, published in&lt;em&gt; &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sms.14138" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF&lt;br&gt;MEDICINE &amp;amp; SCIENCE IN SPORTS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, conducted in collaboration with scientists from &lt;strong&gt;Japan&lt;/strong&gt;, tested whether brief muscle contractions could improve strength without the need for lengthy workouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Testing the Limits of Muscle Contractions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the experiment, &lt;strong&gt;49 sedentary young adults participated&lt;/strong&gt;, split into four groups, to perform different types of &lt;strong&gt;biceps exercises&lt;/strong&gt;. Over four weeks, participants completed a&lt;strong&gt; single three-second movement&lt;/strong&gt; five days a week using their maximum weight load. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The exercises focused on three contraction types: &lt;strong&gt;concentric&lt;/strong&gt;, which involves lifting a weight; &lt;strong&gt;isometric&lt;/strong&gt;, which means holding the weight still; and &lt;strong&gt;eccentric&lt;/strong&gt;, which is controlling the lowering of the weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Eccentric Contractions Lead to the Biggest Gains&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results were unexpected. Those who performed &lt;strong&gt;eccentric contractions&lt;/strong&gt; showed the most substantial gains in strength — improvements ranged between &lt;strong&gt;10 and 13 percent&lt;/strong&gt; across all measured types of muscle contraction. The concentric group recorded a smaller increase of &lt;strong&gt;6.3 percent&lt;/strong&gt; in isometric strength, while the isometric group saw a &lt;strong&gt;7.2 percent gain&lt;/strong&gt; in eccentric strength. The control group, which did not train, exhibited no change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eccentric training&lt;/strong&gt; has long been understood to create &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/08/what-happens-body-drink-baking-soda-water/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="7378" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;higher muscle tension&lt;/a&gt; than other contraction forms. Controlling the downward motion of a weight causes muscle fibers to endure greater stress, which in turn stimulates both the &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/02/straight-out-of-a-sci-fi-nightmare-scientists-just-created-a-robot-that-bleeds-and-even-dies-if-you-stab-it/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="81017" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nervous system&lt;/a&gt; and muscular adaptation more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, despite strength gains, none of the participants showed significant increases in &lt;strong&gt;muscle size&lt;/strong&gt;. The researchers attribute this to early-stage neural adaptations — the brain improving its ability to activate existing muscle fibers before muscle volume grows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Potential for Ultra-Efficient Training Routines&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher &lt;strong&gt;Professor Ken Nosaka&lt;/strong&gt; expressed optimism about the findings, noting the potential for such training to fit into busy lifestyles. “If we discover that the three-second rule applies to other muscles, you could perform a &lt;strong&gt;full workout in&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;under 30 seconds&lt;/strong&gt;,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the study’s short timeframe and focus on the biceps raise questions about whether the results would hold true for larger muscle groups like the legs or back, or over a longer period. Those aiming to increase &lt;strong&gt;muscle mass&lt;/strong&gt; might also need to combine such brief sessions with more traditional exercises. &lt;/p&gt;

She was running a bath for Isla and had bent down to swish the bubbles, but ‘when I stood up, the room violently tilted’, she &lt;a target="_self" href="/yourmoney/product-recalls/index.html" id="mol-99570f00-3f92-11f0-a89b-bd607f746de1"&gt;recalls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘My body gave way and I sank to the bathroom floor, calling out for my husband, Clark. Everything was spinning and I started being sick.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clark, 36, an HGV driver, helped her downstairs and rang her dad who came to drive her to hospital, while he stayed home with Isla. ‘I was lying on my dad’s lap in A&amp;amp;E, slurring, dizzy and vomiting into a bucket,’ says Laura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Laura was told she’d had a type of ischaemic stroke, where blood flow to part of the brain has been cut off&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It was St Patrick’s Day and the others waiting around us gave us looks as if to say, “She’s had a skinful”.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was given a CT scan and neurological tests, such as pointing her finger to the doctor’s as he moved it, trying to smile and providing her date of birth. But she couldn’t do any of these, let alone get the words out, while the anti-sickness drugs and fluids she was given were making no difference. The doctors were seriously concerned and blue-lighted her to Queen’s Hospital in Romford, a specialist neurology hospital some 18 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From the moment the ambulance doors were opened at Queen’s, things moved quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Suddenly a team of medics swarmed around me, shining lights in my eyes,’ says Laura. ‘Inside, I was asked to walk and I fell down like a sack of potatoes.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the initial CT scan hadn’t provided any answers, Laura was given a CT angiography, which produces a detailed image of the blood vessels and tissues surrounding the brain. This revealed a tear in an artery in Laura’s neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They quickly sent me for an MRI scan, then three doctors wheeled me into a room.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Laura was told she’d had a type of ischaemic stroke, where blood flow to part of the brain has been cut off. The torn artery in her neck had cut off blood supply to the cerebellum, the area responsible for movement, speech, balance and posture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was devastated,’ she says. ‘I begged the doctors not to let me die because I had a two-year-old who needed me.’ Laura was given anti-clotting medication and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-6704261/Mother-two-given-just-HOURS-live-brought-brink-death-pioneering-treatment.html"&gt;monitored for three days&lt;/a&gt; before she was allowed back home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Before going home, I was shown my scans,’ she recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was shocked to see about 20 per cent white – signalling damage. I was told it was a miracle I wasn’t in ICU or on a feeding tube because of the extent of the damage, and that if I had been older, I probably wouldn’t have survived.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are two main types of stroke. The vast majority are ischaemic, caused by a blockage, frequently a blood clot. Around 15 per cent are haemorrhagic, where a weakened blood vessel supplying the brain bursts. Laura had a tear in the lining of an artery which caused a flap – this in turn restricted blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘As the body tries to heal the tear, a blood clot can form, which can then block the artery at the site of the tear or travel downstream and block an artery within the brain,’ explains Professor Martin James, a consultant stroke physician at Royal Devon &amp;amp; Exeter Hospital. ‘Some of these tears occur as the result of physical trauma in a road accident, for example, but can also occur out of the blue without warning in otherwise healthy people like Laura.’ However, he adds that this type of tear is quite rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘For most people, a stroke is the start of a life-long journey of recovery. It can be especially challenging for younger people who may have young families and jobs,’ he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is some evidence that strokes are on the rise in younger people – with a quarter of strokes in the UK, around 20,000 cases, occurring in people of working age, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-5337655/Obesity-crisis-means-stroke-victims-getting-younger.html"&gt;according to the Stroke Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while the number of new stroke cases diagnosed yearly has dropped in older age groups over the last ten to 20 years, it has doubled in those under 55, say researchers from the University of Oxford, who recently launched a study to try to understand the reasons behind this rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Fourteen months on, she still suffers with some of the effects of her stroke, including vertigo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The National Young Stroke Study will look at the role of traditional risk factors (such as high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol level, smoking, alcohol and obesity) and emerging risk factors (such as mental health conditions, stress, long working hours and oral health) to improve prevention for this younger group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early detection of stroke is vital to reduce the damage and long-term impact – but this means recognising the early signs, which can be atypical, in all ages, says Professor Debbie Lowe, national clinical lead for stroke medicine and medical director at the Stroke Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Around 20 per cent of strokes affect the back part of the brain when blood flow is affected to areas such as the cerebellum, brainstem [which regulates breathing and heart rate], and certain lobes that impact vision, memory and speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘These type of strokes more commonly cause symptoms such as dizziness, difficulty speaking and visual disturbance, which don’t always get picked up using the common “FAST” check,’ she explains. The acronym recognises the common signs of stroke: facial weakness, arm weakness and speech problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Therefore, it’s important for people – including healthcare professionals – to know about the less common symptoms, too.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These include sudden memory loss or confusion, loss of balance, nausea or sickness, seizures, sudden behavioural changes, and a sudden severe headache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If caught early, ischaemic strokes can be treated with medication to dissolve the blood clot and restore blood supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But these drugs have to be given within four hours of a stroke occurring in order to be effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If brain cells are killed off, patients can be left with disabilities and require physiotherapy and rehabilitation. ‘The ability of the brain to recover from the damage of a stroke is greater in people who are younger like Laura – but it’s a long journey of physical and psychological recovery with setbacks along the way,’ says Professor James.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘People often need support for months or years as they try to rebuild their lives after a stroke.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fourteen months on, Laura still suffers with some of the effects of her stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘When I got home, I kept waking in the night with panic attacks, thinking I was having another stroke,’ says Laura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘And because of some brain damage, I suffer from vertigo, which is horrendous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I can’t walk or stand for very long and sometimes I get so tired I can’t function.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She adds: ‘I avoid lifting anything heavy – the heaviest thing I carry is Isla. Doctors told me not to go on roller coasters or have head or neck massages to avoid the risk of tearing an artery again.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She has since also been diagnosed with lupus, a chronic autoimmune condition where the body mistakenly attacks tissues. This may have weakened the artery, which could have then torn from coughing and led to her stroke – but this hasn’t been confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘During my last stroke consultation, I was told the cause was bad luck and that the artery had torn spontaneously. But I can’t help but wonder if lupus was the true cause.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As well as medication for lupus, Laura also takes clopidogrel (a blood thinner) and a statin to reduce the risk of another stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Laura has returned to work part-time, but says the biggest struggle is emotional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I don’t feel like myself anymore,’ she says. ‘I’m no longer the energetic, healthy woman I used to be. I can’t chase Isla around the garden or crouch down to do colouring with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Isla says I have a “poorly brain” and likes to stroke and kiss my head to make me feel better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Life looks different – but it is still filled with love, purpose and determination to live to the fullest.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Jones, now 54, is a benefits manager at a medical center in Louisville. She was diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a38634921/jada-pinkett-smith-alopecia-bald-video/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a38634921/jada-pinkett-smith-alopecia-bald-video/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="alopecia areata" data-node-id="2.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;alopecia areata&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a46660342/women-autoimmune-disease-study-findings/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a46660342/women-autoimmune-disease-study-findings/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="autoimmune condition" data-node-id="2.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;autoimmune condition&lt;/a&gt; that disrupts regular hair growth, at just 18 months old and has lived with the disease for over half a century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="3" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;For most of her life, she wore extensions, wigs, or “toppers” (small partial hairpieces) to hide her hair loss and feel “normal.” Even after she got engaged, she’d climb into bed before her fiancé—with the lights out—so he wouldn’t see her patchy scalp. “It’s something that you never stop worrying and thinking about. People will say to you, ‘It’s just hair. It doesn’t matter,’” she says. “But when you look at yourself in the mirror, there is no way that it can’t &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/g62988923/celebrities-who-have-spoken-about-hair-loss/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/g62988923/celebrities-who-have-spoken-about-hair-loss/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="take a toll on you" data-node-id="3.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;take a toll on you&lt;/a&gt;, mentally.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But this all started to change in 2021. That year, Jones took part in a clinical trial for a new alopecia areata drug called Leqselvi, which was designed to treat the condition and help grow hair back. Flash forward four years, and Jones looks like she belongs in a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a19947497/best-shampoos-for-thinning-hair/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/beauty/a19947497/best-shampoos-for-thinning-hair/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="shampoo" data-node-id="5.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;shampoo&lt;/a&gt; commercial—her thick, layered locks cascade down in soft waves past her shoulders. “This year, I treated myself to the Dyson Airwrap,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Jones’s hair-regrowth success since she has been on the drug—which the FDA approved in July of 2024—has been particularly dramatic. The new drug joins two others used to treat alopecia areata, Litfulo and Olumiant, which have helped thousands of women and men see their hair restored in recent years. Although the medications, called Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, don’t cure alopecia areata—hair falls out again if patients stop taking it—they are revolutionizing treatment and making the impossible seem possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-11" data-node-id="7" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-6i9ia4 e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img alt="woman with alopecia" title="woman with alopecia" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/alopecia-women2-683765bfbaf6d.jpg?resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/alopecia-women2-683765bfbaf6d.jpg?resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/alopecia-women2-683765bfbaf6d.jpg?resize=980:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/alopecia-women2-683765bfbaf6d.jpg?resize=980:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;p data-element="caption" class="css-1n1zmne e1fodxfw1"&gt; Brandi Jones, 54, was diagnosed with alopecia areata at just 18 months old and has lived with the disease for over half a century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;After taking these medications for a year and a half, up to 40 percent of patients have at least 80 percent of their scalp hair regrown, says&lt;a href="https://kopelmanhair.com/hair-restoration-nyc/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://kopelmanhair.com/hair-restoration-nyc/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" Ross Kopelman, MD" data-node-id="8.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt; &lt;u data-node-id="8.1.1"&gt;Ross Kopelman, MD&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a hair restoration surgeon in New York City and Palm Beach County, Florida. “This is life-changing for a lot of people who have significant hair loss.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;April Noel, 49, experienced this firsthand. The music teacher from Illinois started taking Litfulo about five years ago and has recovered about 90 percent of her scalp hair. “I’d always hoped I’d get my hair back,” she says. “The first time I drove with my windows down and felt the breeze in my hair, I thought I would cry.” &lt;br data-node-id="9.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="immune-system-overload" data-node-id="10" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="10.0"&gt;Immune System Overload&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="11" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Before diving into the ins and outs of the new treatments, it’s helpful to understand exactly how alopecia areata impacts the body and your hair. At its most basic, this condition occurs when the immune system attacks the hair follicles—like an army mistakenly firing on its own troops. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“That attack doesn’t lead to the death of hair follicles, but it puts them in a dysfunctional state, so they don’t grow hair,” says Brett King, MD, PhD, a dermatologist at Dermatology Physicians of Connecticut, whose research has played a key role in bringing JAK inhibitors for alopecia areata to the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Although its cause is unknown, experts know that alopecia areata has a genetic component. “There’s some sort of environmental input that flips the switch and turns the disease on at a specific time in an individual’s life,” says Amy McMichael, MD, a professor in the department of dermatology at Wake Forest University School of Medicine. “But we don’t really know what that switch is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;With alopecia, everyone’s hair loss pattern looks different. Some people develop circular bald patches, while others lose all the hair on their heads but have it elsewhere. Others grow no hair at all and resort to penciling in eyebrows and wearing fake lashes. Hair growth can wax and wane over the years, frustrating patients and their doctors who don’t know why this happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“One of the unique things about this condition is you can go into remission at any time,” says Deeann Graham, 53, an alopecia advocate and educator, author of &lt;a href="https://www.alopecialife.com/products-shop/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.alopecialife.com/products-shop/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Head-On, Stories of Alopecia" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="15.1.0"&gt;Head-On, Stories of Alopecia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and host of the podcast &lt;a href="https://www.alopecialife.com/" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.alopecialife.com/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alopecia Life" data-node-id="15.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="15.3.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="15.3.0.0"&gt;Alopecia Life&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Graham was diagnosed at 7, had regrowth at 14, and then lost almost all of her hair between 28 and 32. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="16" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“When I was diagnosed, they said the most predictable thing about it is its unpredictability,” says Caitlin Riley-Klepac, 37, a mental health therapist in Lansing, Michigan, who, with the loss of hair on the sides and back of her head, likes to say she could pass for a punk rocker. She lost much of the hair on her body (one armpit would grow hair; the other wouldn’t) and has tattooed eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-12" data-node-id="17" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="medium" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-medium embed css-6i9ia4 e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img alt="woman with alopecia" title="woman with alopecia" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/alopecia-women-68376508b431b.jpg?resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/alopecia-women-68376508b431b.jpg?resize=768:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/alopecia-women-68376508b431b.jpg?resize=980:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/alopecia-women-68376508b431b.jpg?resize=980:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-swqnqv e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;p data-element="caption" class="css-1n1zmne e1fodxfw1"&gt;Deeann Graham, 53, is an alopecia advocate and educator, author of Head-On, Stories of Alopecia and host of the podcast Alopecia Life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;p data-node-id="18" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Women are more likely to develop the condition, which typically starts in childhood. It’s also more common in Black, Hispanic, and Asian populations, says Dr. McMichael.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Alopecia areata patients also often have other autoimmune disorders. About three in 10 people with alopecia areata have autoimmune thyroid disease, and the same ratio stands with rates of eczema, says Dr. King. It’s not uncommon to also see patients with inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="shaking-the-stigma" data-node-id="21" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="21.0"&gt;Shaking the Stigma &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;For the roughly 700,000 Americans who suffer from alopecia areata, the social and emotional consequences and stigma of a bald or patchy scalp are tough to contend with, which makes effective treatments like Litfulo revolutionary. In fact, the mental impact of the condition is on par with developing post-traumatic stress disorder, according to Dr. King.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Stigma can run deep within society’s psyche. For starters, humans seem hardwired to think something is “wrong” with a person missing hair—perhaps because it can be a sign of illness or aging. Case in point: When people in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2777018" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2777018" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="studies" data-node-id="23.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="23.1.0"&gt;studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are shown photos of alopecia patients who still have eyebrows and scalp hair, they say that the patients look like normal people, according to Dr. McMichael. But when the scalp hair and eyebrows are removed, they say the person looks ill. “The patients are assumed to have some sort of really severe disease,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="24" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;And this just increases the stigma people with alopecia feel. Lara Ziobro, a 45-year-old working in marketing and communications from New Jersey, was diagnosed in early 2024, and noticed that having no hair “makes it seem like you’re not taking care of yourself, like there’s something wrong with you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This shame and stigma can make people with alopecia hold back, avoiding activities that might expose them to humiliation—like going to a swimming pool or dating. Riley-Klepac kept her diagnosis from her closest friends and used to hide when anyone stopped by her home and she wasn’t wearing a wig. Since Graham was diagnosed while still in grade school, she remembers being teased in school and classmates pulling off her wig. When she first met her husband, she had only a few bald spots. And it took her a few weeks to build up her courage before sharing her diagnosis. “Thinking about telling him was pretty consuming,” she says. But she knew she’d have to break the news eventually, because you can’t hide alopecia. &lt;br data-node-id="25.1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Hair is also often part of self-expression. And Ziobro felt like she was losing a part of her identity after she started losing her hair. “I was always so proud of my hair. It was one of my trademarks,” she says. Where she used to switch up her hair—dyeing it red or blonde, going from long to short—she now switches her part from side to side or arranges her remaining hair to disguise bald spots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="body-image" data-lazy-id="P0-13" data-node-id="27" class="embed"&gt;&lt;div size="large" data-embed="body-image" class="align-center size-large embed css-1p5z8fr e1fodxfw4"&gt;&lt;div class="css-uwraif e1fodxfw3"&gt;&lt;img alt="hairbrush with hair strands entangled on bristles" title="hairbrush with hair strands entangled on bristles" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/wh-lead-alopecia-brush-683764d0991c3.jpg?resize=640:* 640w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/wh-lead-alopecia-brush-683764d0991c3.jpg?resize=980:* 980w, https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/wh-lead-alopecia-brush-683764d0991c3.jpg?resize=2048:* 1120w" src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/wh-lead-alopecia-brush-683764d0991c3.jpg?resize=2048:*" class="css-0 e1g79fud0"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1gccgwy e1fodxfw2"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-theme-key="photo-credit-figcaption" class="css-7lsrpf e1g9hcy40"&gt;&lt;span data-theme-key="photo-credit-creditor" class="css-1xs3or1 e1geg53v2"&gt;getty images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 id="jak-to-the-rescue" data-node-id="28" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.0"&gt;JAK to the Rescue&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;So far, three JAK inhibitors have been approved for severe alopecia areata by the FDA. Olumiant (baricitinib) was approved in 2022 for adults, Litfulo (ritlecitinib) in 2023 for adults and adolescents age 12 and over, and Leqselvi (deuruxolitinib) in 2024 for adults. These treatments work by blocking Janus kinase enzymes, which play a role in a key immune system-signaling pathway that results in inflammation. By targeting these enzymes, the medication helps repress inflammatory responses in hair follicles, keeping them healthy. The first JAK inhibitors were designed to treat other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis (another autoimmune condition), and have also shown promise for some skin diseases including eczema and vitiligo. Other JAK inhibitors for alopecia areata are in the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="30" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;About half of people taking the approved new wonder drugs see significant hair growth, which is a high bar for any medication. “It’s really quite extraordinary,” says Dr. King. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="31" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But some patients see less-than-stellar results—or no results at all. Naomie Schreuder, 24, who lives in the Netherlands and participated in a clinical drug trial in Germany, gave up after a year and a half on a JAK inhibitor when she didn’t grow back any hair. “I was very hopeful,” she says. “I saw a lot of people who had great success.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;While there are exceptions, the drugs generally appear to be less effective in people who’ve had the disease for longer. (Schreuder has had alopecia areata for 21 years.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="33" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Sandra Kelberlau, 51, an art conservator in Raleigh, North Carolina, has had moderate hair growth with Olumiant. But she’s noticed that if she has a virus or needs to take antibiotics, it triggers a flare of hair shedding. Missing doses can also cause problems, according to Amelia Anderson, 32, a web designer in Meridian, Idaho. When her prescription refill was briefly delayed four months into starting the medication, she began losing hair within a few days.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="34" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Currently, JAK inhibitors are only approved for people who have severe alopecia areata—those with 50 percent or more hair loss. Many people using the drugs have tried other treatment options in the past that didn’t work. Corticosteroids, either taken orally or injected directly into bald spots on the scalp, are a mainstay of treatment and help calm inflammation linked to the disease. But unlike JAK inhibitors, they are effective only at the injection sites, and are not systemic treatments. Steroid treatments are still used by patients with mild to moderate hair loss and an important option, Dr. McMichael says. And doctors may also use steroids at the same time as JAK inhibitors to help promote more hair growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="36" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Ziobro’s disease falls in the mild-to-moderate category. So, her dermatologist injected a steroid into bald areas as they appeared on her scalp, about once a month, which she says made it feel like they were playing whack-a-mole. (She is not currently doing injections since her bald spots have minimized but would resume if needed). Her head would hurt after the shots, and she’s experienced itching and redness, but, so far, the treatment has kept her bald spots to a minimum by helping her hair grow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="37" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Topical and oral minoxidil (the active ingredient in Rogaine) can also help keep the hair follicle in the growth phase, allowing hair to increase in diameter and density, and is sometimes used in tandem with the new JAK inhibitors, says Dr. McMichael. And the immunosuppressant drug methotrexate can help treat alopecia areata by helping treat the inflammation that causes hair loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="38" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But so far, JAK inhibitors are the most promising long-term treatment doctors have seen for full hair regrowth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section data-embed="editorial-link" data-lazy-id="P0-15" data-node-id="39" class="embed"&gt;&lt;aside class="css-13bgmn2 e94w1mj9"&gt;&lt;h6 class="css-1pxsip e94w1mj7"&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-before" class="css-13p2wp0 eagam8p0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj5"&gt;Hair Loss And Alopecia Areata From WH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span aria-hidden="true" data-theme-key="title-design-element-after" class="css-0 eagam8p1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;h2 id="unwanted-effects" data-node-id="40" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="40.0"&gt;Unwanted Effects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="41" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The side effects of these revolutionary medications can be a challenge, particularly in the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="42" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Early on, Anderson felt mild nausea and fatigue and also experienced mood swings and occasional headaches, but the effects gradually diminished as her body adjusted to the medication. The drugs also confer a greater risk for common infections such as colds and UTIs. They can also raise cholesterol levels, which means some patients may need to take cholesterol-lowering drugs, like statins, at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="43" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;More concerning, the FDA imposed a black box warning on certain medications based on initial trials that used JAK inhibitors for conditions other than alopecia areata. Despite the fact that trials for JAK inhibitor Xeljanz—which is approved for inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis (among others)—had older, sicker subjects who were also taking another drug at the same time, results did show an increased risk of serious heart-related events such as heart attack or stroke, cancer, blood clots, and death. However, the American Academy of Dermatology says not all of these side effects occurred in all safety studies for different JAK inhibitors approved for alopecia areata. However, when a side effect was found in one type of JAK inhibitor, the FDA required it also be listed as a potential risk on the others that function similarly. Still, people with a history of cancer, blood clots, heart attack, stroke, or serious infection should have a conversation with their doctor about their risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="45" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Of course, not everyone who has alopecia areata can take the medications, and some people with the condition choose not to—or can’t afford it. These drugs can cost $20,000 to $30,000 a year, says Dr. Kopelman. “And with this condition you have to be on them forever.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="46" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;This is especially an issue for medically underserved minorities, often people of color, who may have trouble accessing any kind of health care, Dr. McMichael says. Private insurance may or may not cover the cost, and coverage through Medicaid varies from state to state. Pharma companies, however, have put in place several patient programs to try to make this treatment more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-complex-choice" data-node-id="47" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="47.0"&gt;A Complex Choice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="48" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;After decades of coming to terms with their hair loss, people with alopecia areata have mixed feelings about the new medications. Many feel that alopecia has become part of their identity and don’t necessarily feel the need to “fix” themselves to meet social expectations of what they “should” look like. They’ve also found strength in forming supportive communities with one another. Of course, no one would question a person’s right to pursue a powerful, effective treatment for a life-altering disease. But at the same time, Riley-Klepac, Graham, and others in the hair loss community are determined that people with alopecia be comfortable with themselves, whether or not they decide to use the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="49" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Some, like Graham—in league with actress Jada Pinkett Smith and bluegrass musician Molly Tuttle—are happy rocking their bald looks. “It took me years to go bald publicly,” Graham says. “Now there’s no other way for me to be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="50" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;For Riley-Klepac, who started taking Olumiant at the end of last year, excitement about the possibility of growing hair is mixed with guilt. “I sometimes feel like I am cheating on my community,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="51" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;In the summer before her senior year in high school in 2005, she attended a National Alopecia Areata Foundation conference in Tampa. “The sea of bald heads blew my mind,” she says. “At the end of the week, I felt so free without my wig, I got a second-degree sunburn on my head at the swimming pool. Meeting people like me gave me my life back.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="52" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;When Riley-Klepac returned to school, she finally shared her diagnosis with her principal and classmates, first in a public letter, then during an assembly, to great applause. “I got an overwhelmingly positive response,” she says. That year she was elected homecoming queen and proudly wore a special crown (one that didn’t require a comb to attach it) on her bare scalp.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="53" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“I want people to feel confident and happy just as they are,” she says, “with or without a full head of hair.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/cdce7187-8561-48f3-9dfb-a3d969961e0b_1614362203.png?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Beth Howard" title="Headshot of Beth Howard" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-19s3ilq ev8dhu54"&gt;Beth Howard writes about health and psychology from North Carolina.

data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventeen years ago, Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, set out on a personal and scientific mission. At the age of 53, he wasn’t just interested in treating disease anymore. Instead, he wanted to understand why some people seem to age effortlessly, staying active and sharp even into their 80s and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;He believed the secret might lie in their genes. But what he discovered over the next decade and a half turned that idea on its head.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The myth of genetic magic: Why DNA wasn’t the answer&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with The Washington Post, Topol and his team spent more than six years decoding the DNA of 1,400 people aged 80 and above, all of whom had no major chronic diseases. These were the “super agers,” people who had seemingly defied time. But to his surprise, their genetic profiles didn’t have much in common. The expected pattern, the so-called “ageing gene” was missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if it wasn’t genetics, what made these individuals defy ageing? This question became the foundation for his new book, which describes hundreds of studies on ageing and health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Not a miracle drug or an expensive therapy, but consistent physical movement. Among all lifestyle changes, exercise was the only intervention proven to slow down the biological ageing process across the entire body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t just about looking younger. The science showed that regular physical activity could literally adjust the pace at which the body ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Strength over speed&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, Topol had focused on cardio, like walking, cycling, and swimming. But while writing his book, he stumbled across mountains of evidence about strength training. It changed his perspective and his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He began resistance training in his 60s and quickly became stronger than he’d ever been. It wasn’t just muscle — his balance improved, posture got better, and there was a new sense of physical confidence. All from simple tools: dumbbells, resistance bands, and bodyweight movements like planks and lunges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What stood out was grip strength — a simple marker — which had a strong link to long-term health and survival. A firm handshake, it turns out, might be more than just polite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The unexpected benefits of moving with purpose&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Topol’s approach wasn’t about spending hours at the gym. He trained at home, short, focused workouts a few days a week. But he added something else: balance training. Exercises like standing on one leg or reaching down while balancing helped protect against falls and supported brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also emphasised the benefits of being outdoors and staying socially connected. Nature and friendships, two things taken for granted, have scientifically proven effects on emotional and physical health. When combined with movement, they become a powerful trifecta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Study finds obesity drug helps teens in losing weight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Healthspan over lifespan: Living better, not just longer&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal, as Topol explains, isn’t just to live longer, it’s to stay healthy longer. A concept known as healthspan. This means living free of major diseases like cancer, heart disease, and neurodegeneration for as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1402378/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; show that healthy habits, especially regular exercise, can add seven to ten extra years of good health. That’s nearly a full decade of life with independence, energy, and vitality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Topol, now 70, doesn’t dream of immortality. He just wants to make it to his late 80s still active, sharp, and disease-free. And the science suggests that this isn’t just wishful thinking, it’s an achievable reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 10:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMizgJBVV95cUxPRi1Ic01NMTFlUDFYYVJlMDRQZHNJVFZjRWJDb1k5aHBhczRpUS12ZmJ0d3J0d2Nhd2dDd0RBdXhqTmZ3OXJnNk4ySWUwRjlNdE81OTB0OEo1T05ZaF9ETkJIdTQ0TjV0MkhmQnU0cUZNWTRvX3JBOXhsSnZsZVZHNHd1QmNVSFZFZ1BKYWJRMVl0UV9zWU45MGVxcHJJaE5VejBYbnNpdmV3bEw4WG56bzRVdDQzcnJpaV9KQWpRVFBEZ081NjcxaFNETFVIYW1YdG9jdzZKTFRYcFJycFhFVjNxQ3p0UE9uS2FUcE9FMkM3emJBdFpwMEdUc0ZqUmFERGxEWEFQMEh1VXFFbElVVWhSRFlGRUFsLWljdkpqUzZ0amRXNkdud3MwWlJyUVlTY1ZKWmh0c2wtMFE1QXFQQU12eTdqY0JxNVFmX2pn</guid></item><item><title>防晒霜有毒吗？互联网上的紫外线真理肯定是这么认为的。-《波士顿环球报》 | Is sunscreen toxic?

Nearly a quarter believe drinking water and staying hydrated will prevent a sunburn (the latter is a theory none other than Tom Brady &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/tom-bradys-absurd-anti-sunburn-hack-confirms-his-tb12-method-is-the-new-goop/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWhen%20I%20was%20growing%20up,keep%20my%20skin%20from%20peeling." target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.thedailybeast.com/tom-bradys-absurd-anti-sunburn-hack-confirms-his-tb12-method-is-the-new-goop/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWhen%20I%20was%20growing%20up,keep%20my%20skin%20from%20peeling."&gt;seems to believe&lt;/a&gt;, per his 2017 book, “The TB12 Method”).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Brigham and Women’s Hospital dermatologist &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/abby.waldmanmd?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&amp;amp;igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.instagram.com/abby.waldmanmd?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&amp;amp;igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw=="&gt;Abigail Waldman&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t need a study to show her the growing skepticism.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;She learned that firsthand, in 2023, when she posted a TikTok video with what seemed like basic, if perhaps even dull, advice: wear sunscreen on exposed skin and reapply it regularly. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The vitriolic responses, and there were hundreds, had a theme: She was a shill for big pharma. She was propagating the lie that sunscreen protects against skin cancer. She was saying this to … somehow … get more patients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I had no idea that this was a public sentiment,” she said. “It had never been discussed in medical school or any of my training.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But the misconception that it’s harmful is so common that even educated people believe it, she said. “I went to play tennis yesterday, and my coach was like, ‘I’m not putting chemicals on my body.’ He’s an engineer.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The skepticism has its roots in reality, if only very tangentially, said Timothy Rebbeck, a professor of cancer prevention at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, whose research focuses in part on false claims connected to cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“This is a phenomenon we see in a lot of cancer misinformation,” he said. “There is a kernel of truth to a story.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;For example, he said: a study is done in a test tube or an animal that shows a compound found in microscopic levels in sunscreen, when exposed to ultraviolet light, could cause DNA damage.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;That result, taken out of context, makes its way to social media, where it’s sensationalized and amplified. “By the time it gets to your social media feed, it doesn’t resemble the original piece of information,” he said. “No one goes back to the original paper and sees that it was in mice.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Even if sunscreen raised your risk for skin cancer — which it doesn’t, he emphasized — its well-established cancer-fighting benefits would outweigh any risk. “If you’re trying to make a choice, the choice is pretty clear.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;There are two types of sunscreens: physical blockers, which have zinc oxide or titanium dioxide and reflect ultraviolet rays from the sun; and chemical blockers, which contain chemicals that absorb the sun’s ultraviolet rays. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="" class="image | relative margin_bottom_16

A new study published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/01650254241289319" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;International Journal of Behavioral Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; suggests that parents’ beliefs about social hierarchy and obedience to authority may shape the development of this socio-cognitive ability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers set out to explore how broader social and political attitudes held by parents might be linked to their children’s ability to understand others’ perspectives. Previous studies had already shown that children’s theory of mind can be supported by hearing language that refers to thoughts, feelings, desires, and beliefs—what is often called mental state talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, less was known about how parental attitudes toward authority and inequality might influence this kind of talk, especially when discussing people from groups perceived as different. The new study aimed to fill that gap by examining two belief systems: social dominance orientation—the belief that some groups deserve to be dominant over others—and right-wing authoritarianism, or the belief that people should submit to established authorities and social norms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’ve always been interested in social sensitivity and human interactions, but I fell into the topic by virtue of knowing I wanted to work with children, and there being two professors I could work with. One, David R. Olson, was exceptionally nice and happened to be studying theory of mind. I wanted to work with him because I liked him,” said study author Ted Ruffman, a professor of psychology at the University of Otago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team recruited 79 mother-child pairs in New Zealand. All participants were of European ethnicity and spoke English. The children ranged in age from two to nearly six years old, with an average age of about 3.7 years. The researchers assessed the mothers’ social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism using standard psychological questionnaires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also measured the children’s language ability and their theory of mind skills using well-established tasks. These included activities like identifying when a character in a story held a false belief or had different desires from others—tasks commonly used in developmental psychology to assess children’s social understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these assessments, the mothers participated in a picture description task. Each mother was randomly assigned to view a series of images showing either European or Chinese children and asked to describe the pictures to their child “as if reading a storybook.” The photos depicted children expressing different emotions or reaching for objects, and the mothers’ descriptions were recorded and analyzed. The researchers focused on how often the mothers used mental state words like “think,” “feel,” “want,” or “hope,” and categorized them by type, such as cognition, emotion, or desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that mothers who scored higher in social dominance orientation or right-wing authoritarianism used fewer mental state words when describing the Chinese children, who were considered an outgroup. However, this relationship was not seen when they described pictures of European children, who were considered part of their ingroup. This suggests that the mothers’ attitudes influenced their willingness—or perhaps their ability—to engage in perspective-taking when the target of discussion belonged to a different ethnic group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the researchers also found a broader link between these maternal attitudes and children’s theory of mind scores. Regardless of which set of pictures the mother described, children whose mothers scored higher on social dominance orientation or right-wing authoritarianism performed worse on the theory of mind tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This held true even after accounting for the children’s age, language ability, and the mother’s education level. These results suggest that a parent’s social and political attitudes may influence a child’s social development in more general ways—not just through moment-to-moment interactions, but possibly through broader patterns in parenting and communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings highlight a potentially important link between a parent’s worldview and a child’s social-cognitive development. If parents who see the world through a lens of hierarchy or strict obedience tend to talk less about thoughts and feelings—especially when discussing people from different backgrounds—children may miss out on opportunities to practice understanding others’ minds. Over time, this could hinder the development of empathy and perspective-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are things you can say to your child, talk to them about the mental states and feelings of others, that will help the child become a cooperative and insightful human being,” Ruffman told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with all research, there are limitations to consider. One is that the study was cross-sectional, meaning it cannot establish cause and effect. It’s possible—though less likely—that children with lower theory of mind somehow influence their parents’ beliefs, or that both are shaped by a third factor like shared temperament or household dynamics. Additionally, the study only included mothers of European ethnicity in New Zealand, which limits the generalizability of the findings to other cultural and demographic groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the researchers suggest that longitudinal studies could provide stronger evidence about the direction of the relationship between parental beliefs and children’s theory of mind. Such studies could also explore whether other factors, like parental empathy or subtle nonverbal behaviors, help explain how these beliefs are transmitted. Given that both social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism have been linked to prejudice and reduced empathy in adults, the idea that they could shape children’s ability to understand others is worth further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Don’t fear the truth,” Ruffman added. “Infants might not actually know very much, so let’s not work so hard to show that they do. ‘Big’ journals shouldn’t have a bias to publish early-onset findings (which they clearly do).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/01650254241289319" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;What she believes or what she says?

					&lt;p&gt;Sixty is considered middle age by today’s standards, which means you could still have plenty of vibrant years ahead. That’s why being in great physical shape should be high on your priority list. But how do you know if you are as fit and strong as you should be at 60? We took the guesswork out of the equation with five expert-approved &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/best-strength-workout-to-shrink-belly-fat-reduce-inflammation/" target="_blank"&gt;strength workouts&lt;/a&gt;. If you can do the below movements at 60, you’re literally decades ahead of the fitness curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As we age, we need to focus on getting as strong as possible,” &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/luke-carlson-9769816/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Luke Carlson&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, ACSM certified exercise physiologist, ACSM certified cancer exercise trainer, and founder and CEO at &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.discoverstrength.com/our-team" target="_blank"&gt;Discover Strength&lt;/a&gt;, tells us. “We don’t need to be more active, become more flexible, or increase mobility, we need to get strong … There is no fountain of youth, but there is strength training.”&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;All muscle groups decline pretty evenly. But as we get older, there is more loss of “fast twitch” muscle fibers, which allow forceful contraction of muscles, Luke points out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To counteract this, we can perform the basic strength training exercises listed above and on the final few reps, when the weight becomes very challenging, we should attempt to lift the weight fast,” he explains. “Of course, the weight won’t actually move fast because we are so fatigued. But this attempt to lift the weight fast taps into these fast twitch muscle fibers (in a very safe manner).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the five movements Luke recommends doing to &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/tennis-ball-grip-strength-longevity-test/" target="_blank"&gt;test your longevity and performance&lt;/a&gt; at 60.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to do a bodyweight squat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand tall with your feet shoulder-distance apart and arms at your sides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Descend into a bodyweight squat, maintaining a tall chest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower until your thighs become parallel to the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your heels to rise up.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A chest press works the chest and triceps. You can perform the chest press motion with dumbbells, a machine, or by doing a pushup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lie flat on your back on a workout bench, holding a dumbbell in each hand just outside your chest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your feet flat on the ground and maintain an engaged core.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press the dumbbells over your chest until your arms are extended but not locked out.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shoulder press will increase the strength of the triceps and shoulders. You can do this exercise using a dumbbell or machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your core tight as you stand tall with a dumbbell in each hand held at shoulder height.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press the dumbbells overhead until your arms are completely extended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use control to lower the dumbbells to shoulder height.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lower back extension is a stellar movement to address chronic lower back pain, as it strengthens the muscles of the lower back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Position yourself on a back extension bench with your feet locked in and hips situated just above the pad.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross your arms in front of your chest or hold onto a dumbbell for extra resistance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower your upper body toward the ground while maintaining a neutral spine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lift your torso until your body becomes straight from your head to your heels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pause at the top of the movement before lowering with control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Dietary flavonoids are categorized into six subclasses, each one residing in certain foods and having specific health properties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The subclasses are anthocyanins (berries, red grapes, plums, red cabbage), flavan-3-ols (green and black tea, cocoa), flavonols (onions, kale, arugula, watercress), flavanones (citrus fruit), flavones (parsley, thyme, celery) and isoflavones (soybeans, lentils, chickpeas).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;About the latest research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The study, published last month in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, investigated the relationship between intake of flavonoids and flavonoid-rich foods and &lt;a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/article-flavonol-rich-diet-helps-you-stay-strong-as-you-age-study-suggests/" rel=""&gt;frailty&lt;/a&gt;, impaired physical function and poor mental health, indicators of unhealthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The research team analyzed data from two U.S. studies: the Nurses’ Health Study (females) and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (males). A total of 62,743 women and 23,687 men, ages 60 and older, were followed for 24 and 12 years, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Information on age, body measurements, lifestyle behaviours, medication use, family medical history and recent personal health diagnoses was collected every two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Participants provided detailed dietary information at baseline and every four years thereafter. A “flavodiet” score was calculated for each participant by adding up intakes (servings/day) of key food contributors to total flavonoid intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Key flavonoid-rich foods included blueberries, strawberries, grapes, raisins, apples, oranges, orange juice, grapefruit, grapefruit juice, tea, red wine, onion and sweet bell peppers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Frailty, measured every four years, was defined as having at least three of five criteria: fatigue, poor strength, reduced aerobic capacity, at least five chronic illnesses and a weight loss of five per cent or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Participants reported perceived physical limitations in basic mobility, daily living tasks and performing various moderate and vigorous activities. They were also asked about symptoms of depression, anxiety and overall well-being. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;High flavodiet scores protective&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Among participants in the Nurses’ Health Study, those with the highest flavodiet scores had a 15 per cent lower risk of developing frailty, a 12 per cent lower risk of developing impaired physical function and a 12 per cent lower risk of developing poor mental health during the study period compared to women with the lowest flavodiet scores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The highest intakes of tea, red wine, apples, blueberries, strawberries, oranges and orange juice – and increased intakes of these foods over the study period – were associated with a lower risk of all three outcomes in women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Surprisingly, fewer protective effects were seen in men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Participants in Health Professionals Follow-up Study with the highest (versus lowest) flavodiet scores were 18 per cent less likely to have poor mental health scores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Higher intakes of tea and blueberries were tied to a lower risk of poor mental health. Intakes of key flavonoid-rich foods were not associated with risk of frailty or impaired physical function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;It’s unclear if there are differences in diet-related risks factors for health in aging between males and females. The findings in men may also have been influenced by the shorter follow-up of 12 years, resulting in fewer outcomes being reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The researchers also found that a daily increase of three servings of flavonoid-rich foods and beverages during the study translated to a 6 to 11 per cent lower risk across all three outcomes in females and a 15 per cent lower risk of poor mental health in males. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;To arrive at their findings, the researchers accounted for other influential factors including age, smoking status, family health history, personal health, physical activity, body mass index and calorie intake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-ad--base l-media"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How flavonoids safeguard healthy aging&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The new findings are in keeping with previous studies linking high intakes of flavonoids or flavonoid-rich foods to a lower risk of frailty, impaired physical function and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Flavonoids’ strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects are thought to protect cells from damage caused by oxidative stress and inflammation, factors that accumulate during aging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Elevated levels of inflammation can lead to loss of muscle mass and strength. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;Inflammatory immune compounds can also communicate with the brain, affecting mood and energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Takeaway&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;The findings suggest a modest, yet doable, dietary adjustment – increasing your daily intake of flavonoid-rich foods by three servings – can optimize healthy aging and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;One serving is equivalent to one half-cup of blueberries, strawberries or grapes, one ounce of raisins, one whole orange or apple, one half of a grapefruit, five ounces of citrus fruit juice, eight ounces of tea, one slice of raw onion or one half-cup cooked or one-quarter of a small bell pepper. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:raw-html-body-33-CY6AVRWLJFATJLIHGKR22JEB4Y" data-fusion-component="raw-html-body-33-CY6AVRWLJFATJLIHGKR22JEB4Y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:raw-html-body-33-CY6AVRWLJFATJLIHGKR22JEB4Y" data-fusion-component="raw-html-body-33-CY6AVRWLJFATJLIHGKR22JEB4Y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-body__text text-pr-5"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Leslie Beck, a Toronto-based private practice dietitian, is director of food and nutrition at Medcan.

By Oct. 31, when she was 33 weeks pregnant, she felt something was off and was very unwell. She called an ambulance and went to the Staten Island University Hospital. That’s when she was told that she had preeclampsia and was showing severe symptoms of it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4UBLIWET75FJ7J4VQSVNRD6U4E"&gt;“They told me that if I didn‘t come in [that] I probably would have lost my life at any given moment because my blood pressure was so high,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="E7L74EKBONESFEI5DIOB4AU76I"&gt;Preeclampsia is diagnosed if someone has persistent high blood pressure, protein in their urine, or other signs of organ damage and typically begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy in women whose blood pressure had previously been in the standard range, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/preeclampsia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355745" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/preeclampsia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355745"&gt;according to Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="75JSUOYLWZEGPGQCHJMPCVGLC4"&gt;“I‘m very in tune with my body...

Other symptoms are headaches, blurry vision, light sensitivity, dark spots, upper right abdominal pain, swelling in hands/ankles/face, and shortness of breath. Severe preeclampsia may cause a person to produce little or no urine, develop fluid in the lungs, and experience decreased kidney or liver function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="7F4AQ7KK2NESBN2VBN7RD4YHVQ"&gt;While the exact cause of preeclampsia is unknown, several factors can increase your risk during pregnancy. These include carrying twins, triplets, or more; being pregnant for the first time; being over age 35; having a family history of preeclampsia; and having conditions such as high blood pressure, kidney disease, diabetes, autoimmune disorders like lupus, or obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FYR2Q37YLRDGXJAMZOPXVL4PO4"&gt;Gonzalez shared that she has had normal blood pressure during physical check-ups her entire life and no health conditions that would indicate a risk for preeclampsia.

At 33 weeks pregnant, she was initially supposed to stay until 37 weeks, but her condition worsened, prompting doctors to deliver her baby immediately.

But as the weeks passed and it still hadn’t gone away, she took her to the doctor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not much later, Cameron was diagnosed with cancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mjaldridge" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Miranda Aldridge;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Miranda Aldridge&lt;/a&gt; first noticed a tiny bump near her daughter Cameron’s eye, it didn’t seem alarming, just unusual. But as the weeks passed and it still hadn’t gone away, Miranda, who doesn’t consider herself a “panic mom,” began to worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of August 2024 — after nearly a month of watching and waiting — Miranda decided to take Cameron, 3 at the time, to the pediatrician. The doctor suspected it was a cyst and referred them to dermatology for a closer look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s when the real frustration began. Although the referral was sent in late August, the earliest available dermatology appointment wasn’t until April of the following year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We couldn’t believe it,” Miranda, 30, tells PEOPLE exclusively. “It just didn’t seem right to wait that long for a child.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miranda Aldridge&lt;/p&gt; Cameron Aldridge when the bump began to appear&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the Palatka, Fla.-based family booked the appointment and tried to stay optimistic. But by the first week of September, the bump had grown significantly. Alarmed, Miranda and her husband, Bryan, 40, began calling local dermatologists daily, sometimes multiple times a day, hoping for a cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One day, an office called and said, ‘Actually, can you come right now?’ And I said, ‘Yes,’ ” Miranda recalls. “I’m a teacher, and it was the beginning of the school year, everything was hectic. But I dropped everything and got her in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That urgent visit proved critical. The dermatologist immediately saw something the pediatrician hadn’t. She didn’t think it was a cyst, but rather a pilomatricoma, a slow-growing, benign tumor that forms in hair follicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were referred to plastic surgery at the local children’s hospital, and a procedure was scheduled just two weeks later, on Sept. 27, 2024. By then, the bump had doubled in size.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miranda Aldridge&lt;/p&gt; Cameron Aldridge on surgery day&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was huge,” Miranda says, adding that cancer still wasn’t on their radar. “We were just relieved it was finally getting taken out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://forms.dotdashmeredith.com/people-news-inline" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surgery lasted only 10 to 15 minutes and seemed to go smoothly. Afterward, the plastic surgeon told Miranda and Bryan that Cameron, now 4, had done great and described the mass as fatty tissue, not a typical cyst or tumor. Still, it was sent to pathology as a precaution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were told to expect results within a week,” Miranda says. “In our minds, it was done. We didn’t think about it anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just four days after surgery, before the pathology report even came back, Miranda noticed something troubling: beneath Cameron’s butterfly strips, the bump was already reappearing. She assumed it was swelling. Then came the call.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Miranda Aldridge&lt;/p&gt; Cameron Aldridge after surgery&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was Oct. 3, 2024. Miranda was at work when she saw the surgeon’s office number on her phone. When she answered, they asked to do a video call to discuss the results. She wasn’t expecting bad news — then the surgeon said the word “malignant.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Obviously I knew what it meant,” Miranda says. “But it still didn’t sink in. She told us oncology would be reaching out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During her planning period, Miranda rushed home to tell Bryan in person. “We just sat there,” she says. “I kept saying, ‘It can’t be leukemia — she’s not even sick.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after, the next call came, this time from the children’s hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The woman on the phone apologized and said the biopsy showed leukemia,” Miranda says. “I don’t remember much after that.” But she does remember asking: “Do we need to come now?” The answer: “Yes. Go home, pack a bag, and plan to stay at least a week.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back at school, Miranda held it together long enough to pick up Cameron, pack quickly, make arrangements for their older children — her daughter Charlotte and stepson Carter — and head straight to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was a whirlwind,” she says. “Everything changed in a moment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That night, at the hospital, the oncologist spent more than an hour walking Miranda and Bryan through everything: the diagnosis, treatment plan and next steps. It was information most parents receive over days or weeks delivered all at once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, doctors suspected acute lymphoblastic leukemia. But after Cameron’s bone marrow aspiration the next day, the results came back completely clear: no leukemia cells, no abnormalities. Her spinal fluid was clean, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days later, on Oct. 6, full-body CT and MRI scans revealed the only visible cancer was the tumor on her face — though slightly enlarged lymph nodes were also detected. With no cancer in her bone marrow or spinal fluid, her diagnosis was revised to B-cell lymphoma, which according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/non-hodgkin-lymphoma/about/b-cell-lymphoma.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Cancer Society;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt; is the most common type of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most common symptoms is enlargement of one or more lymph nodes. Other symptoms can include fever, chills, night sweats, weight loss, feeling tired and swelling in the abdomen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My husband and I — we’ve never experienced anything like this. We wouldn’t wish it on anyone,” Miranda says. “That first night at the hospital, I laid on that couch and waited for someone to come in and say, ‘We got the wrong kid.’ But they never did.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of Miranda Aldridge&lt;/p&gt; Cameron Aldridge in the hospital&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron began treatment immediately. Her plan includes five phases: induction (weekly chemotherapy), consolidation (weekly chemotherapy plus spinal taps with intrathecal methotrexate) and a third phase every 10 days, depending on her blood counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth phase, delayed intensification, which she's in now, is the most intense, involving multiple chemotherapy drugs and more spinal taps. Then, in late June or early July, Cameron will begin the final phase: maintenance. That phase will continue until December 2026 and includes spinal taps and IV chemo every 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can't really remember her being upset about going in the beginning," Miranda says. "Since we started this, she’s always stayed pretty positive about going to the clinic. But her port, that’s been a challenge. She was only 3 when all of this started, so of course it’s scary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Actually, just this past week was the first time she didn’t cry,” she adds. “She’d been psyching herself up, saying, ‘I’m not going to cry this time. I can do it without crying.’ And now she can. She even said, ‘I’m never going to cry again. It doesn’t even hurt.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think about myself, how when I don’t feel good, I just want to lay down and do nothing,” Miranda continues. “But she always wants to do something. She wants to get out of the house, go on a little adventure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As doctor visits became a regular part of life, Miranda and Bryan began documenting the journey, not only to keep friends and family updated, but to help themselves focus on moments of joy. Miranda started by posting on Facebook, sharing one positive thing each day: a photo, a small moment, something good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before long, she turned to &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mjaldridge" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TikTok;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/accounts/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fmiranda.aldridge%2F&amp;amp;is_from_rle" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Instagram;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, where she already had a modest following from her teaching days. She began posting short videos that captured glimpses of their daily life, sometimes joyful, sometimes difficult, often both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The videos quickly gained traction, drawing thousands of views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miranda Aldridge&lt;/p&gt; Cameron Aldridge in the hospital&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the real turning point came when the family learned Cameron would soon lose her hair. Miranda says, “She’s always been very girly — bows, ponytails, jewelry — so I knew that part was going to be tough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help her prepare, Miranda and Bryan gently explained that the medicine helping her body would also make her hair fall out but that it would grow back. They read children’s books together and pointed out other kids at the clinic who had already lost their hair, always emphasizing how beautiful and brave those children looked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By December, the hair loss began. Cameron would find strands on her pillow. She could run her hand through her hair and watch it come out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then one day, Miranda came across a TikTok video that showed a hairstylist named Carly, recently diagnosed with breast cancer, sitting in a salon chair while friends and loved ones each took a turn cutting a piece of her hair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I lost it,” Miranda says. “I showed it to Cameron, and she lit up. She said, ‘Mom, I want to do that. I want you to cut my hair. I want Dad to cut my hair. Can Bubba cut my hair?’ She just ran with it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They let the idea sit for a while, but Cameron kept bringing it up, especially as her March birthday approached. “I kept wondering if it was too soon,” Miranda says. “She was just 3, turning 4. Should I really let her make this decision? It was hard.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around that time, a friend who had been through breast cancer reached out and offered to take photos and help document the haircut. Miranda agreed and decided to make a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mjaldridge/video/7483193445260070174" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TikTok video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;TikTok video&lt;/a&gt; too. That video now has more than 60 million views and upwards of 148,000 comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, Miranda has transformed her page — which recently surpassed 1 million followers — into a space dedicated to Cameron’s journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Having a video go viral, you think, 'Wow, so many people saw this. So many people commented,' ” Miranda says. “But then to have so many people follow us — follow Cam — that’s what really hit me. They’re not following me. They’re following her. They want to see what’s happening in her world, all the little things along the way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s been the most overwhelming part,” she adds. “It’s not just that a bunch of people watched one moment, it’s that they want to keep showing up for her.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shelby MacClellan&lt;/p&gt; Miranda Aldridge with her daughter Cameron&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with the support from their online community, Miranda says the family has been incredibly blessed by the outpouring of love and help from their local community. At the start, they rallied together to help Miranda take a few weeks off work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, they organized a fundraiser, launched a local T-shirt drive and so much more. Schools, churches, friends, family and even strangers have cooked meals, sent small gifts for Cameron, dropped off care packages at their door and offered constant prayers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We absolutely wouldn’t have been as strong as we were at the start if it wasn’t for our community,” Miranda says. “It’s hard to accept being on the receiving end of so much support, but it’s important to remember, you can always pay it forward. We’ve felt that very strongly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As their platform continues to grow, Miranda sees it as a meaningful opportunity to give back. That vision inspired the recent launch of &lt;a href="https://courageforcam.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Courage for Cam;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Courage for Cam&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit dedicated to spreading hope, love, and courage to children facing pediatric cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miranda and Cameron created a coloring book together — one of several in the works — with 100% of proceeds going directly to the nonprofit. Their goal is simple but powerful: to get these books into the hands of kids facing tough diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shelby MacClellan&lt;/p&gt; A closeup of Cameron Aldridge&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It’s a way to bring joy and creativity into hospital rooms, chemo chairs and quiet moments when children need a little light," Miranda says, adding how their nonprofit is also hosting a T-shirt fundraiser featuring designs inspired by Cam’s spirit and strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When things feel impossibly heavy, I try to keep perspective,” she adds. “Knowing that even in our own pain, someone else is facing something even harder. You don’t have to carry it all on your own. Let people in, because the kindness of others can carry you further than you think. This was the most challenging part for me, and ultimately became my biggest blessing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shelby MacClellan&lt;/p&gt; The Aldridge family&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Miranda and her family, she adds how despite the social media following, it’s never been about the views or viral moments — it’s about the connections. They’ve heard from future pediatric oncology nurses, teens who’ve lost a sibling and others walking through their own version of this journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most meaningful connections came when a mother reached out to Miranda after her own daughter was diagnosed, shortly after Cameron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We just clicked,” Miranda says. “I’ve been able to offer her advice, and she’s been such a great listening ear for me, too. They live in another state, but we’re connected. The girls FaceTime, and Cameron gets to see someone her age with a port — someone who truly understands. Her daughter is about to go through hair loss, and she’s been able to watch Cameron walk through it first.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Those connections have been ... I don’t even know how to describe them. Unbelievable,” Miranda adds. “That’s what’s made this journey feel a little less heavy.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/mom-spots-a-bump-near-3-year-old-daughters-eye-it-turned-out-to-be-cancer-exclusive-11736285" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 08:41:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE9IRmlLQVgzWDNaLXhrYjBuQnpPc1dnQXNVaVptNWxQc25PUmNLdVpUN1ZnN2IzeWxRX21iaUVMQVZzVHllUUFQb2JZc2tpT2RUWnhZTGFxQ0hXWE5PNnFnYUlzUGpTZHUwRVZhR3ViNDc4QQ</guid></item><item><title>曾经被誉为科学奇迹的mRNA现在已成为政府目标- statnews.com | mRNA, once lauded as a scientific marvel, is now a government target - statnews.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxOUm96R0NMNjNJOHlTaWpqdkg4YUFuQ0dTelZibzI1bU8yNGc4SVJjMnp5cHF6QVRjQnlnMmF2bmhvdTdCbHg1TUc2VHFoUnp5YjA5SlpUWHVzS0lRaUVXYVc0b0p1TzBNU3d3aENPckJLTjFoWkRYSGtjVFBoMUdWZUFnTFFISTU5RjN1bDEwWDVMZmRldjRJdTM3T05YS1hyYzkyNXhYUDlKQ1VLMDE1RFlIYw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="author-pop-over" data-author="isabella-cueto"&gt;&lt;p class="author-bio"&gt;Isabella Cueto covers the leading causes of death and disability: chronic diseases.

		&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON — mRNA, a Nobel-winning technology harnessed by Trump officials to create Covid shots in record time, is becoming a political reject as the nation’s leaders openly embrace vaccine skepticism. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Republican lawmakers and federal health officials alike are shunning messenger RNA, a basic building block of biology that &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/21/mrna-vaccines-safety-efficacy-senate-committee-probe-myocarditis-adverse-events-covid-shots/"&gt;proved its value during Covid&lt;/a&gt;, and that holds promise for combating the next pandemic and unlocking new cancer treatments. Public health experts and biotech companies are watching in horror as the government cuts its investments in the technology, and as officials like health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. foment deep distrust of mRNA vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the Department of Health and Human Services confirmed it was canceling &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/28/moderna-flu-vaccine-development-cancelled-by-hhs-mrna-platform-offers-speedy-pandemic-response/"&gt;more than $700 million worth of contracts&lt;/a&gt; with Moderna to develop, test, and license mRNA vaccines for flu strains that could cause future pandemics, including the H5N1 bird flu virus. &lt;/p&gt;

Yes. Tummy rolls? Tick. But the wedge-shaped piece of us that's called the 'silent organ' doesn't usually get a look-in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's hardly a surprise. The liver doesn't have any pain receptors so it goes under the radar for most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But your liver is also your body's hardest-working organ. It's busy, making up about two per cent of an average human's body weight and holding 13 per cent of your blood supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's the place in your body where everything is processed - and plays a central role in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-0726c640-3c2a-11f0-8afb-cb6fe68711e0"&gt;weight loss&lt;/a&gt;, digestion, immunity, blood sugar control, hormone regulation and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Clinical nutritionist Sarah Di Lorenzo, author of The Liver Repair Plan, says the liver is 'critical for our good overall health'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If your liver is not well, then your entire body will know about it,' she says. 'When your liver health is poor, it's a roadblock to reaching your health goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Think about weight loss – your liver is involved in your metabolism, so if it's not working properly then your metabolism is impacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'When people improve their liver health, the weight starts falling off, while their skin, energy, mood, libido, stress and sleep improves,' says Sarah di Lorenzo, author of The Liver Repair Plan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When people improve their liver health, the weight starts falling off, while their skin, energy, mood, libido, stress and sleep improves.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If your liver's in trouble, you might not even realise it until it's damaged and inflamed - which is why Di Lorenzo says it's important to look out for the subtle signs, and there are some you might find surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When your liver has damage, it doesn't produce enough clotting proteins so you may bruise easily,' Di Lorenzo explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is also a sign of progressive liver damage and can be from any type of liver disorder.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Constant headaches are 'a common sign of liver dysfunction' to look out for, adds Di Lorenzo. They can be caused when the liver is compromised and can't filter toxins from the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dark circles under your eyes are also a 'telltale sign' of impaired liver function. 'When the liver can't clear waste, it's deposited in the vessels under the eyes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Struggling to lose weight is a big one that Di Lorenzo has encountered all too often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The liver is one of many roadblocks for people struggling to lose weight,' she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In his 60s, David's liver was under strain. By following Sarah's plan, he reduced his biological age by 20 years - and his doctor was astounded&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When our liver is burdened, it can't function properly, which impacts how it metabolises nutrients and fat, slowing down our metabolism and leading to weight gain. In a compromised liver, toxins can build up and hormonal imbalances can occur, leading to really stubborn weight gain.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of particular concern is excess weight around the midsection, which suggests there is fat between the organs of the abdominal cavity rather than subcutaneous fat, which is fat under the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you're suffering from bloating and a pot belly, Di Lorenzo says you could be suffering from a condition called ascites, where the liver malfunction leads to a build-up of fluid - this is when liver disease is very advanced and linked to liver cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Having a tongue with a white coating on it can also indicate liver problems, as can itchy spots on your arms, legs and soles of the feet, which are a surprising sign that something's amiss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Importantly, our energy levels are also linked to the liver, so if you're feeling unusually fatigued it could be a sign to go to your doctor to get your liver checked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you do have some of the above symptoms, the good news is that the liver has the greatest regenerative capacity of any organ in the body. Even after 90 per cent of it has been removed, it can regrow to a normal size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;That doesn't mean it's invincible - many diseases can destroy it beyond repair - but there are things you can do right now to support its regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One thing to do is - with guidance from your doctor - look at what supplements and pain relief medications you're taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'While herbs and supplements may seem harmless because many can be purchased over the counter, some can be toxic to our liver,' Di Lorenzo explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Many people are genuinely surprised when I share this information – they wonder how something "natural" could be toxic to the liver – but it's true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Many people take over-the-counter supplements because they think they're being healthy, but you should only take what you really need. Ideally, use practitioner-only ranges that are clean and effective.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the herbs and supplements to 'be careful of', according to the expert, are aloe vera, bodybuilding supplements, green tea extract, traditional Chinese medicines and weight-loss supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, Di Lorenzo says pain relief medications should only be taken 'when you really do need them'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I know many people who take them for the mildest of symptoms. Pain-relief medications like paracetamol and NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen) can damage the liver,' she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In the developed world, paracetamol is the most common cause of acute liver failure. Ibuprofen is linked to liver damage because it can increase the liver enzyme ALT (alanine aminotransferase), meaning liver cells are damaged or have died.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other simple ways to support liver regeneration are to reduce your alcohol consumption and stay hydrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Di Lorenzo's rule of thumb is to drink 30ml of water for each kilo of body weight per day; get regular check-ups with your doctor; aim to get to a healthy weight and stay at it; and eat a healthy and balanced diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But what foods are key to achieving the best result?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Sarah Di Lorenzo's book, The Liver Repair Plan, published by Simon &amp;amp; Schuster is out now&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Di Lorenzo advises looking for antioxidant-rich foods that are full of fibre, good fats and polyphenols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Coffee, coriander, cruciferous vegetables, tea, grapes, blueberries, seeds and nuts all get the tick of approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The best foods for our liver are those that support comprehensive liver function and detox pathways. While all healthy, real, whole foods support our health, some key foods have a bigger impact so should have starring roles in our diet,' she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Embracing herbs and spices in your diet is a good way to add to the taste without amping up the salt, with Di Lorenzo saying they are 'amazing at accelerating the nutritional profile of your meals'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fibre-rich foods are also important for keeping your bowel functioning, avoiding constipation and keeping cholesterol low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Plus, fibre protects the liver from inflammation,' says Di Lorenzo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Think of eating a rainbow of fruit and vegetables, high-fibre whole grains, good fats, lean proteins, nuts and seeds, legumes, and calcium-rich dairy foods.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-medium health-ccox mol-style-bold"&gt;David's story&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sydney man David O' Toole began working with Sarah Di Lorenzo in November 2023 after tests showed his liver was under strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After just four weeks of following Di Lorenzo's recipes, cutting out alcohol and incorporating Pilates into his routine, he saw his liver function return 'to textbook levels', something he and his doctor 'could hardly believe'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Now, in my mid-60s, I feel decades younger, with recent tests confirming that my biological age is in the 40s,' explains David, who calls his experience 'life-changing'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was determined not to follow the path that so many my age take - frequent doctor visits and a growing list of ailments,' he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is clear to me that our medical system is struggling under the weight of preventable health issues, and I am so grateful to have found a path that allows me to take full responsibility for my health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;Sarah Di Lorenzo's book, The Liver Repair Plan, published by Simon &amp;amp; Schuster is out now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Foods that fall under the category include red and processed meats, sugary drinks, refined grains like white pasta or bread and even tomatoes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Bowel cancer can cause you to have blood in your poo, a change in bowel habit, a lump inside your bowel which can cause an obstructions. Some people also suffer with weight loss a s a result of these symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pizza was classed as anti-inflammatory as it contains cooked tomatoes, which are high in the powerful antioxidant, lycopene.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study found colon cancer patients who ate more inflammatory food than 80 per cent of the volunteers had a 36 per cent higher risk of dying from their cancer than those who ate very little.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Experts, presenting the findings at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) conference in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/chicago/index.html" id="mol-1ae2bf90-1f2a-11ef-bfef-172cb460e31a" class=""&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, said that, while there is not yet enough evidence to support the anti-inflammatory diet as a recommendation for cancer patients, this may be the case in the near future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;In the study, scientists tracked 1,625 patients with colon cancer that had spread to the nearby lymph glands, but not beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All volunteers completed food questionnaires about how often they consumed foods that fell under 18 food groups—nine pro-inflammatory and nine anti-inflammatory. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over a follow-up of three years researchers found that patients in the top 20 per cent of most inflammatory diets had a &lt;span&gt;36 per cent higher risk of dying from their cancer than those who consumed least. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Those in the top 20 per cent also had an 87 per cent higher risk of death overall than the bottom 20 per cent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;When exercise was taken into account, those who consumed the least inflammatory diet and maintained the highest levels of physical activity had a 63 per cent lower risk of death. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The Nova system, developed by scientists in Brazil more than a decade ago, splits food into four groups based on the amount of processing it has gone through. Unprocessed foods include fruit, vegetables, nuts, eggs and meat. Processed culinary ingredients — which are usually not eaten alone — include oils, butter, sugar and salt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ASCO president and top cancer specialist Julie Gralow said the findings suggested 'we need to be essentially prescribing healthy diet and exercise. The combination of the two are synergistic.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Catherine Elliott, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-04a73a20-3f05-11f0-849f-612e04caad7d"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Research UK's director of research, also told MailOnline: 'This study adds to interesting emerging evidence about the role of inflammation in the progression of colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We need more high-quality research like this to help us uncover more about how our diet influences cancer outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; 'When it comes to food and cancer risk, our overall diet is far more important than any single food or ingredient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A healthy, balanced diet includes eating lots of fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, and healthy sources of protein like beans and chicken. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cutting down on processed and red meats, and foods high in fat, sugar and salt also helps.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It comes as other research presented at ASCO found colon cancer patients who stuck to an anti-inflammatory diet reduced their risk of the disease spreading or recurring by 38 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, by scientists at Maimonides Medical Centre in New York, tracked the food habits of 796 patients who had been diagnosed with the disease between 2015 and 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found consuming a diet high in ultra-processed foods raised the odds almost two and a half times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ultra-processed foods increase inflammation and colon cancer risk while anti-inflammatory diets offer protective benefits,' they said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Dietary intervention must play a role in preventing cancer.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colon cancer, long considered a disease of old age, is &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14631623/doctor-five-signs-colon-cancer-rise-Gen-Z-Millennials.html"&gt;increasingly striking people in their 20s, 30s and 40s&lt;/a&gt; in a phenomenon that has baffled doctors around the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the last 30 years, young diagnoses of the disease have shot up by 80 per cent across the globe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 32,000 cases of colon cancer are diagnosed every year in the UK and 142,000 in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 06:59:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqAFBVV95cUxOQ0xadnpUbDUzbmpwQy12bU5rSlZQYXdPTWNOVjBYRXRFRkJKQk5rSEh5VzJ1Z2hGT0pUeW9wcVNzcmg3ckhsS3kxUHd5QVBkdktHYkhvSDQ5cURqT19tT3JHWWpVZF9TdVJ3R185TnFJTXJiOEU5eExIVDByV2V0LWh2c2JSOE9sLXRPZjhLZXVlNHNrNHBra1lpWDZibk52dUhUVUF3OGrSAa4BQVVfeXFMTUU0NDBZb1R4U0FXdGFwLXlGUkxsdWliRW5kNC1tOEF3M1d3M2RINHhIWUZ4MmNjaUE0cTViZmdmVGo2SzFIeGN3NHp0b1BPUE1MZWVxOXZNV3FtcXhSbTVUZG01cEs4djBQdldwMDJTOElDRDdwMGYtRmNBUkFlQlg3TUdvOTEySW9OSkYyOXZmMzJZQnNhdzNhVE96WlhEa2Y5RW9RMlZyM29FZl93</guid></item><item><title>日本科学家开发出兼容所有血型的人造血-东京周末 | Japanese Scientists Develop Artificial Blood Compatible With All Blood Types - Tokyo Weekender</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxPUG1lNnB5TmNYdlM2SWU3bHk5Qm1xVnhMODFyaVNSTkJobTk4SmVzYmVfMDZNMDExdVJUYUFfSFlhR1RhZ0ttMlBnQW5YcHdJbGJ0YTBFRmhVMVdjOUI3ZHFPZ2Y0NWo2czRTYjk5OXZ4SDhnSVRRNUNNT2Q0bWlQcEJabnV0NFJ3bVE2U1pPRDlFdmhNU1lXdkZ6V0Y4cWlmc19fNg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content post-template-standard"&gt;

Maintaining an adequate blood supply, though, is no easy task, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). The demand for O&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW34223700 BCX0"&gt;–&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW34223700 BCX0"&gt;negative blood — the universal donor type — often exceeds supply and donations have a limited shelf life. Looking to address the issue are a group of Japanese scientists led by Hiromi Sakai at &lt;a href="https://www.naramed-u.ac.jp/university/english/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Nara Medical University&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW34223700 BCX0"&gt;They’ve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW34223700 BCX0"&gt; developed a new type of artificial blood that can be used in patients of any blood type. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="EOP SCXW34223700 BCX0" data-ccp-props="{}"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It is then encased in a protective shell to create stable, virus-free artificial red blood cells. As these artificial cells have no blood type, there is no need for compatibility testing. The synthetic blood can &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW166998970 BCX0"&gt;reportedly be&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW166998970 BCX0"&gt; stored for up to two years at room temperature and five years under refrigeration. That is a significant improvement over donated red blood cells, which can only be stored under refrigeration for a maximum of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW166998970 BCX0"&gt;42 days&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW166998970 BCX0"&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="EOP SCXW166998970 BCX0" data-ccp-props="{}"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span data-contrast="auto"&gt;Small-scale studies began in 2022. Three groups of four healthy male volunteers aged 20 to 50 received a single intravenous injection of hemoglobin vesicles — artificial oxygen carriers that mimic the structure of red blood cells — in increasing amounts, up to 100 milliliters. While some participants experienced mild side effects, there were no significant changes in vital signs, including blood pressure. Building on that success, Sakai announced that his team was accelerating the process last July. In March, it started administering between 100 and 400 milliliters of the artificial blood cell solution to volunteers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span data-ccp-props="{}"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="TextRun SCXW144022034 BCX0" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US" data-contrast="auto"&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW144022034 BCX0"&gt;If no side effects are confirmed, the trial will shift to examin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW144022034 BCX0"&gt;ing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW144022034 BCX0"&gt; the treatment’s efficacy and safety. It aims to put the artificial red blood cells into practical use by around 2030. While these studies are taking place, Professor Teruyuki Komatsu of Chuo University’s Faculty of Science and Engineering is also working on the development of artificial oxygen carriers, using albumin-encased hemoglobin to stabilize blood pressure and treat conditions like hemorrhage and stroke. So far, animal studies have shown promising results. As a result, researchers are now eager to move to human trials.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="EOP SCXW144022034 BCX0" data-ccp-props="{}"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Their &lt;strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"&gt;solipsism&lt;/strong&gt;, and general lack of interaction with one another, causes Iris to liken them to orbiting planets that never intersect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-13o6u42 eoo0vm40" id="link-2a73f04"&gt;Daily Word Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Can you correctly use the word &lt;strong class="css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10"&gt;solipsism &lt;/strong&gt;in a sentence?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Based on the definition and example provided, write a sentence using today’s Word of the Day and share it as a comment on this article.
