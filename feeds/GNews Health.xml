    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bariatric surgery is generally considered the most effective solution for long-term and significant weight loss, with studies showing patients lose significantly more body weight after surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The expected weight loss is about 10 to 15 percent for Wegovy and Ozempic and 15 to 21 percent for Zepbound and Mounjaro, which compares to 25 to 35 percent for bariatric surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Surgery - which can cost in excess of $10,000 - is more invasive, has associated risks like leaks, bleeding, blood clots, and infections, which can be severe and even fatal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Longer-term issues can include nutritional deficiencies, gallstones, bowel obstruction, acid reflux, and scarring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the Tufts team believe their new drug can mimic the effects of weight loss surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unlike other GLP-1 medications, the scientists say the new drug targets four 'dimmer switches' in the body, which manage appetite, satiety, blood sugar and energy use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The four hormones it acts on are GLP-1, GIP, glucagon and Peptide YY (PYY).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead author Tristan Dinsmore, PhD, a researcher at Tufts University, explained to Fox News: 'We built a single experimental peptide that works like four hormones at once, so we're not pushing one button too hard. Instead, we're nudging four 'dimmer switches' together... [It helps to] balance things out.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tristan Dinsmore, a graduate student in the Kumar lab and the lead author of the study, added: 'There is one more hormone we wanted to bring in to complete a weight control quartet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's called peptide YY (PYY). This molecule is also secreted by the gut after we eat a meal, and its job is to reduce appetite and slow the process of emptying food from the stomach, but via different mechanisms than either GLP-1 or GIP. It may also be involved in directly burning off fat.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;PYY is from a separate and structurally unrelated class of hormones than the first three, so blending the different molecules was a difficult process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Justine Martin lost 33lbs on Mounjaro but needed to stop due to side effects. She reported the food noise coming back, gaining 5.5lbs and her 'resolve hanging by a thread'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the medication is far off from being available as it is still in development and has not yet been tested in human trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy are used by over 15 million adults in the US, or 4.5 percent of the population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite their effectiveness, they have drawbacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their effect may not last after discontinuing use, and side effects including osteoporosis and muscle loss have raised concerns about long-term harms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also induce nausea, which can make it difficult to stay the course of treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For certain weight loss medications, particularly GLP-1 receptor agonists (such as Wegovy and Zepbound), there are reports of severe side effects, including suicidal ideation and gastrointestinal issues like gastroparesis (stomach paralysis).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, evidence is conflicting, and regulatory agencies like the FDA have not established a direct causal link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, after stopping weight loss drugs, patients tend to regain approximately two-thirds of the weight they lost within a year, with significant weight gain occurring as hormone levels return to their pre-treatment state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Scientists claim to have hit upon a new weight loss drug which is more than twice as effective and comes with less side effects than Ozempic and Wegovy (stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy are used by over 15 million adults in the US, or 4.5 percent of the population&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Krishna Kumar, a professor of chemistry at Tufts who led research on the new weight loss drug, explains: 'The biggest problem with GLP-1 drugs is that they have to be injected once a week, and they can induce a very strong feeling of nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'As much as 40 percent of people using these drugs give up after the first month.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mounjaro or Zepbound (the brand names for tirzepatide) have less nausea associated with them and they work by activating both the GLP-1 and GIP hormone pathways, making them 'dual-acting' drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is currently another drug called retatrutide, which targets three hormone pathways, in clinical trials but the Tufts team say their 'four-in-one' hormone drug would be a game-changer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Martin Beinborn, a visiting scholar in the department of chemistry, concluded: 'By hitting four different hormone receptors at the same time, we hope to improve the chances of averaging out such variation toward the goal of achieving greater and more consistent overall effectiveness.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Tufts report appeared in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.5c04095"&gt;Journal of the American Chemical Society.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 20:27:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQVXJ5Yk91VWxpdkZYeTU4eUJOS2pfR3R3a0JudGI3b0ZJcFFUVzBUblExcWNYLW12T1Q2dEtmbVUwYVZ0dVBvZnZ2Ui1RYmxlRlNvYlF0QU5ab3lGZ3NTaDFpZkxHTF9NVFRnOFFrZngydDgweldWcTVSeEt6cWtEYUt5V1hxeWlSV2N0N1ZUNVdpTFJDR3BsRUZIdG3SAaIBQVVfeXFMT25BV28tc0R2NW5DVFpJdE84QnRiYkp5dHFWRVZQLUpZVTdjem55OFpXX3YxbWxUbFZEZENySmtRY1hDOXVjejdPTHFqVW9fOFhzaTk0N0VRQm9rV0JKTDM4ZUh5ZzJqNndtcFFTTXJ5UE1ZRTV1dTljSXdLWVhxT1VvLVR6c3hyenoyMTJiWjZXazhJSGtZSGhUVmwtV0NNVENB</guid></item><item><title>大多数人不正确地测量血压。以下是正确操作的方法- ClickOnDetroit | WDIV Local 4</title><link>https://www.clickondetroit.com/health/2025/09/08/most-people-check-blood-pressure-incorrectly-heres-how-to-do-it-right/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-7 fURyTV iQviKm articleBody" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="dist__Box-sc-1fnzlkn-0 dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-3 bYFsJw cuqaEv article-text"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DETROIT

It’s a question that has puzzled both philosophers and neuroscientists for decades, but has proved notoriously difficult to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, a study that recorded patterns of brain activity in 15 participants suggests that colours are represented and processed in the same way in the brains of different people. The findings were published in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Neuroscience &lt;/i&gt;on 8 September&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now we know that when you see red or green or whatever colour, that it activates your brain very similarly to my brain,” says study co-author Andreas Bartels, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Tubingen and the Max Planck Institute, both in Tubingen, Germany. “Even at a very low level, things are represented similarly across different brains, and that is a fundamentally new discovery.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bartels and his colleague Michael Bannert wanted to explore how different colours are represented in parts of the brain associated with vision, and how consistent this is across different people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-01252-3" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02901-3/d41586-025-02901-3_50911966.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;Brand-new colour created by tricking human eyes with laser&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare activity in the brains of a group of participants while they viewed different colours. This allowed them to create a map of brain activity that showed how each hue was represented neurologically. They then trained a machine learning model called a linear classifier on this data, and used it to predict which colours were being viewed by members of a second group of study participants, on the basis of their brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

I am in a suburban shopping complex on a Tuesday afternoon, getting a massage from an Aescape robot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Aescape &lt;a href="https://www.aescape.com/about" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;describes&lt;/a&gt; itself as a “pioneering lifestyle robotics company” that is “revolutionizing the wellness industry by introducing exceptional massage experiences”. Put simply, they make robot masseuses: cushioned tables with two large, white, robotic arms that rub your body based on your preferences and preselected programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;I love massages – I am never happier than when the profane flesh sack I call my body is being kneaded like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/WHs7CLJErmQ" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Wagyu beef&lt;/a&gt;. So I opt for a 30-minute “Power Up”, which costs $60 and promises to leave me feeling “invigorated and alert”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;ccording to the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/benefits-of-massage-therapy" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Mayo Clinic Health System&lt;/a&gt;, massage therapy can help with a number of conditions including anxiety, depression, sports injuries, digestive disorders, headaches and soft tissue sprains. It can also improve circulation, strengthen the body’s immune response, lower stress levels and increase energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But is a massage from a machine as good as a massage from a person?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="2cd87f66-3485-4c1b-aab5-b832a3d228c2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-47fhrn"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":8,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"What is lymphatic drainage massage and why do celebrities love it?","elementId":"2cd87f66-3485-4c1b-aab5-b832a3d228c2","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/feb/22/what-is-lymphatic-drainage-massage-benefits"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":4}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“There are so many contraptions out there. My mom has a massage chair and I use a Theragun at home,” says Crista de la Garza, a board-certified massage therapist in Colorado. While there can be value in these tools, De la Garza says she is not worried about a robot coming for her job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;First, there are real physical benefits to being touched by a person. During the early pandemic, for example, when people were isolating and social distancing, many reported feeling “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/feb/28/the-power-of-touch-is-this-the-sense-we-have-missed-most" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;skin hunger&lt;/a&gt;” – a sense of deprivation and abandonment that comes from not getting enough physical touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A 2024 paper in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-024-01841-8" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; said that receiving touch was “of critical importance” and found that touch interventions helped reduce pain and feelings of depression and anxiety in adults. The paper also found that touch interventions from objects or robots “resulted in similar physical benefits, but lower mental health benefits”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It is a powerful thing to be touched safely and appropriately and therapeutically,” says De la Garza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In fairness, Aescape’s &lt;a href="https://www.aescape.com/faqs" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; says it “is not about replacing therapists”. Instead, “it’s about enhancing their work and addressing the industry’s labor shortage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="937245ad-92c8-4a5f-85cf-95756c168898" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-fd61eq"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A robot masseuse made by Aescape.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Courtesy of Aescape&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Nothing can replace a human,” the efficient, blond receptionist tells me when I arrive for my appointment. I’m late because of parking woes, but the machine doesn’t care. It’s a regular spa, with manicures, pedicures, human massages and crystals for sale at the front desk. On our way to the robot’s chamber, she says the Aescape has been popular, especially with clients who “aren’t comfortable being touched by a stranger”, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Inside, she hands me a high-compression, Aescape-branded top and leggings to &lt;a href="https://www.aescape.com/news/what-to-wear-to-a-massage" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;wear&lt;/a&gt; during my treatment. Apparently, they help enhance the machine’s “body detection”. I lie down on the table and hold very still while the Aescape scans my body. She shows me the screen controls and an emergency button that I can press if anything goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-17" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

What kind of music would I like to listen to? Lo-fi ambient jazz, classic rock or a playlist called “brat”? I can view an unsettlingly detailed outline of my body – they didn’t need to depict my saddle bags so clearly – or soothing videos of the ocean, a snowy mountain or a rainy forest. I can adjust the height of my headrest and change the pressure of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;One of the things that makes De la Garza skeptical about robot massage is that it “makes you think too much”. Getting massaged by a person involves more surrender – the therapist controls most of the experience, she says, and the client can turn off their brain: “The client’s job is to breathe, communicate as needed, and simply be in a relaxed state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Indeed, I find myself distracted by the urge to tweak the music and scenery. Do I like looking at snow? It’s OK. Can I relax to the “brat” playlist? No – back to ambient lo-fi. Is that really what my butt looks like?

What if the powerful robotic arms skewered my soft flesh like a pile of antipasti? I, on the other hand, was more worried it wouldn’t be strong enough, and that my knots of tension would remain coiled and tight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But the massage is enjoyable. The robot’s blunt, plastic hands are gently warmed. They can’t knead and poke as precisely as human fingertips, but their ministrations feel pleasant. Actually, the hands are more like knobs, roughly the size and shape of small Dutch clogs. It feels a little like someone pressing their fist into your back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;At the end of my session, I feel looser and more relaxed than I had at the beginning. I don’t feel invigorated, exactly, but I do think I could drop into a deep, dreamless sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;It is certainly no substitute for a real massage. I like the surrender and precision of a normal massage, and the Aescape can’t massage the head, hands or feet. But if I can see myself going again if I feel particularly sore after a workout, or if I find myself roaming around a suburban shopping center with 30 minutes to kill. It’s relatively cheap, and you don’t have to tip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 16:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQOU5SWDNlSEFvOGw4TEZ1RlN3aEdzMkxRdk5aZnlXVGZEVThBY2ZMZW5Lb2JFcG1QWWh5RXBZYlMxZVp5RG1JSWJLMnlDM2FEX3Fvdi1pdFBHSE83ZTZidjBCLVN4aUFsUEZBRzRwcm0zV0dvd2dvbjFJUHNsSFI1ZC0wVXJKbHN0</guid></item><item><title>工作人员从坎伯兰建筑区倾倒的自卸卡车中救出人员- WJAR</title><link>https://turnto10.com/news/local/crews-rescue-person-from-tipped-over-dump-truck-in-cumberland-construction-zone-sept-8-2025</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="index-module_storyColumn__EZ7G" id="js-Story-Content-0"&gt;&lt;p class="StoryTags-module_tagWrapperLine__Jfav"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dateline"&gt;(WJAR)  — &lt;/span&gt;The Cumberland Fire Department responded to a tipped over dump truck at a Cumberland construction zone on Monday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department responded around 7:13 a.m. to 50 Lynch Place for the reported accident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responding officers found a heavy-duty quarry-type dump truck with a person inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The department says that wearing a seatbelt saved the victim from further injury, but that they had suffered a significant injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First responders used hydraulic rescue tools to free the victim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crews transported the victim to Rhode Island Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WJAR</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 15:36:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwAFBVV95cUxPLUljZ2d2aHhfQ0ZBaVNsdVFROWFqYlVrYVBqTFl1YmZOOXdaeFZ5Qnd3SHpaUC1rM01jRnRTT0hlLXN2UTNZTU9kUG02T0w2cWE0YW0xRzFhZ2Uxc3JiT210a0tkYzlPR1U2Q1doTkxqbDlnM19vcHJhdk1NX0VMWHlyY3NDRmQzWVhJZjEzeG96eDUza1pLYkNlSmZfY2NUaWxmd2RleVIwZVUxd0hha1dGSldERTNiNVVEODMxR0U</guid></item><item><title>胃肠病学家警告说，到30岁时，每天只喝1杯苏打水就可能导致脂肪肝晚期： “即使是年轻、健康的人……” |健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/gastroenterologist-warns-just-1-soda-a-day-can-lead-to-advanced-fatty-liver-by-age-30-even-young-healthy-people-101757343916280.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/gastroenterologist-warns-just-1-soda-a-day-can-lead-to-advanced-fatty-liver-by-age-30-even-young-healthy-people-101757343916280.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Soda has become a staple in many people's diets, from office lunches to late-night snacks.

The liver often doesn't give early warning signs. By the time you notice symptoms, the damage may already be underway.”&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Quoting a &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2880768/" target="_blank" class="backlink" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="study"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the World Journal of Gastroenterology, Dr. Vivian notes that just 5–7 years of daily soda consumption can push your liver toward:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;– Fatty liver disease (MASLD)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;– Liver scarring (fibrosis)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;– Inflammation and long-term damage&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How to protect your liver&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And here's what many don't realise: &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/fatty-liver-disease" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="fatty liver"&gt;fatty liver&lt;/a&gt; isn't just an 'older person's' problem. I've diagnosed it in people in their 20s and 30s," she says. Dr. Vivian also mentions that the FDA recently approved a GLP-1 medication for MASLD with moderate to advanced fibrosis, a significant step forward, but stresses that prevention remains key.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The good news? Small swaps make a big difference. Choosing water, sparkling water, or unsweetened tea instead of soda isn't just cutting sugar, it's protecting your liver, your energy, and your long-term health," she advises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This report is based on user-generated content from social media.

Labeling the United States as non-Chagas disease-endemic perpetuates low awareness and underreporting," the report noted, adding the insect has been reported in 32 states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other states with human cases include California, Arizona, Tennessee, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi and Arkansas, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report notes that data is "inadequate" to prove that the insects are increasing in geographic distribution or abundance. But it also says that the bugs are "increasingly recognized" because of frequent encounters with humans and due to more research attention.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Invasion into homes, human bites, subsequent allergic reactions or exposure to T. cruzi parasites, and increasing frequency of canine diagnoses have led to growing public awareness," it says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What causes Chagas disease?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi parasites found in triatomine or "kissing" bugs, which can pass the disease to other animals and humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/chagas-disease-which-can-be-deadly-now-considered-endemic-us" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;UCLA Health&lt;/a&gt;, the insect's nickname comes from the bug often biting people on the face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;According to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, about 8 million people globally and 280,000 in the United States have the disease, often without knowing it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"People might scratch or rub bug feces into a bite wound, their eyes, or mouth without realizing it, which allows the parasite to enter their body," the CDC says, adding bugs pass the parasite in their droppings after biting a person or animal. "If these droppings get into someone's body through a cut in the skin, or near the eyes or mouth, it can lead to infection."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease does not spread from person to person like a cold, nor does it spread through casual contact with those infected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without treatment, the condition can be life-threatening, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Symptoms of Chagas disease in adults&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the acute phase, which happens shortly after infection, a type of eyelid swelling known as Romaña's sign may appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This happens when the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite gets into the eyelid, usually by accidentally rubbing the bug feces into your eye or into a bug bite near your eye," the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other acute signs may include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling tired&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Body aches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rash&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Loss of appetite&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diarrhea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vomiting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others may experience symptoms for years or a lifetime, which is known as the chronic phase of infection, and can include heart and digestive issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"(The disease) can destroy the nerves that feed the various parts of your body — so your heart, your esophagus, your colon," infectious disease physician Tom Moore &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/chagas-disease-kissing-bug-north-delaware-valley-cdc/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;told CBS News Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in 2019 as cases made their way north. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both stages, some people might not feel sick while others can have serious health problems, the CDC adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to avoid kissing bugs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no vaccines or drugs that can prevent Chagas disease at this time, according to the CDC, so it's important to protect yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevention methods include staying in well-built places if traveling, using insecticides and bug spray, wearing clothes that cover your skin and not eating raw fruits and vegetables, as the infection can also be acquired orally or through the mouth via contaminated food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts also previously told CBS News Philadelphia that homeowners can seal windows and keep trash, piles of wood and rocks away from their homes to reduce risk. &lt;/p&gt;

In 2024, Lancaster County had a total of five reported human cases and two deaths, and in 2023, it had zero, according to state DEP &lt;a href="https://files.dep.state.pa.us/Water/WNV/WNVResultsArchive/" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primarily an illness of birds, West Nile virus was first found in Pennsylvania in 2000, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.pa.gov/agencies/pgc/wildlife/wildlife-health/wildlife-diseases/west-nile-virus" target="_blank"&gt;Pennsylvania Game Commission&lt;/a&gt;. The virus is typically &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/about/index.html#cdc_disease_basics_prevention-prevention" target="_blank"&gt;transmitted by infected mosquitos&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike some other illnesses, it doesn’t commonly spread between people — coughing, sneezing and touch do not transmit West Nile virus, according to the federal &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/php/transmission/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. West Nile cases usually peak in late August to early September, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="tncms-inline-relcontent tncms-inline-relcontent-fact"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Human cases of West Nile virus in 2025, by county&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adams: 0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Berks: 2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chester: 1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cumberland: 2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dauphin: 0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Franklin: 0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lancaster: 5&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lebanon: 0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Perry: 0&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;York: 2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Statewide: 25&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://files.dep.state.pa.us/Water/WNV/2025-09-05-WNV_Activity_by_County.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection weekly report dated Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Prevention tips&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since there are no licensed vaccines or medications available for West Nile, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/prevention/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC says&lt;/a&gt; the best way to stay safe is to avoid getting bit. Wearing loose-fitting, long sleeved shirts and pants, using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-registered bug spray with ingredients like DEET, picaridin or oil of lemon eucalyptus and treating clothes and gear with permethrin can help protect you, as can taking steps to control mosquitos, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mosquitoes/prevention/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pa.gov/agencies/dep/programs-and-services/integration/vector-management/mosquitoes#accordion-f190f5e8a0-item-4341a84102" target="_blank"&gt;On its website&lt;/a&gt;, the state DEP encourages residents to remove standing water, which can turn discarded tires, bird baths, containers and even bottle caps into breeding grounds for mosquitos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Health risks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people who catch West Nile virus will experience no symptoms, while about 20% will feel like they have the flu. Less than 1% will experience a more serious version of the disease affecting the central nervous system, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. This can cause inflammation of the brain and of the membranes around the brain and spinal cord. About 10% of those who experience this severe form of the illness will die, and permanent symptoms are possible for those who survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age increases the risk of severe illness from West Nile virus. Adults 65 and older are three times as likely to develop neurologic illness compared with those under 65, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. Conditions like cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure and kidney disease also put people at higher risk of severe illness, as do weakened immune systems, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="tncms-inline-relcontent tncms-inline-relcontent-fact"&gt;&lt;h4&gt;West Nile Virus symptoms&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 80% of people who get West Nile virus will feel fine, but others will experience symptoms ranging from mild to life-threatening. Symptoms typically begin two to six days after infection, but sometimes take as long as 14 days to begin.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Symptoms of mild illness:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Body aches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Joint pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vomiting&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diarrhea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rash&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fatigue and weakness lasting for weeks or months&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;In less than 1% of cases, the virus infects the central nervous system, which can cause inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) and of the membranes around the brain and spinal cord (meningitis). Severe central nervous system illness causes death in about 10% of cases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Symptoms of severe illness:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;High fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Headache&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neck stiffness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stupor&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disorientation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coma&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tremors&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Convulsions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle weakless&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vision loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Numbness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paralysis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/symptoms-diagnosis-treatment/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/hcp/clinical-signs/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p class="clearfix"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="tncms-region-article_instory_bottom" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;div id="tncms-block-1010628" class="tncms-block invert-btn-primary"&gt;&lt;section id="block-1010628" class="block emphasis-h3   "&gt;&lt;div class=" card-bg-color"&gt;&lt;div class="card-panel panel"&gt;

Our team found COVID-19 booster shots available at many locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, multiple pharmacy employees said the vaccines could only be administered with a prescription to people who are either 65 or older or have underlying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those rules could change after the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Policy (ACIP) meets later this month to discuss recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines. The CDC, under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. has been reevaluating decades of U.S. vaccine policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACIP recommendations on COVID-19 boosters could impact the price and availability of the vaccine in Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It could be a lot easier, or a lot more difficult, to get this vaccine than it is today," said Will Humble, executive director of the AZ Public Health Association, "and it could also change whether your health insurance plan is going to pay for it or not."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several governors are not waiting for the CDC committee to act. They are making their own state recommendations to ensure the immunizations will be widely available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, was still weighing her options this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm certainly concerned about new guidance coming out around protections for COVID," Hobbs told reporters on Wednesday. "We're going to look at the options we have to keep Arizonans safe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;You can reach ABC15 Senior Investigator Melissa Blasius by email at &lt;u&gt;melissa.blasius@abc15.com&lt;/u&gt; or call 602-803-2506.

      &lt;p&gt;Pneumonia struck first. Then tonsillitis spiraled into sepsis. Malaria battered him next, and after treatment, the other illnesses flared back up again. This unvaccinated 2-year-old boy is trapped in a relentless cycle.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I was very sad. I knew these things could be prevented by vaccines," his mother Alzhraa Fadul says through an interpreter.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I feel guilty that I can't do anything to help my son," the 26-year-old adds. "I'm worried about my son every day. I should've gotten vaccines for my son."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But there was nowhere for Fadul to get them. Her family lives in an abandoned classroom with 10 strangers in Kosti, Sudan, where vaccination campaigns were once &lt;a href="https://www.emro.who.int/ar/sdn/sudan-news/sudan-launches-yellow-fever-vaccination-campaign-among-ethiopian-refugees-and-host-communities.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hailed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a "remarkable achievement" and &lt;a href="https://www.emro.who.int/sdn/sudan-news/sudan-kicks-off-november-subnational-polio-immunization-campaign-to-vaccinate-45-million-children.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;earned&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the country a coveted polio-free status one decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That all changed in April 2023 when civil war &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/04/27/1172123699/sudan-conflict-explained" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;broke out&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Sudan rapidly rose to the top of the list of countries with the highest proportions of unvaccinated newborns — claiming an unwanted leading position last year, with more than half of its babies missing all immunizations. Fadul's son is &lt;a href="https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-health/immunization/" target="_blank"&gt;one of the 14 million kids&lt;/a&gt; worldwide who don't receive any vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We're really in the eye of the storm here," &lt;a href="https://www.unicef.org/sudan/unicef-representative-sudan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sheldon Yett&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says. Yett, who is UNICEF's representative in the country, adds that &lt;a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/no-end-sight-sudans-two-years-war" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;more than 70%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the country's health facilities in conflict-affected areas are in "ruins." "Children who would have otherwise been able to brave the many things that Sudan throws at children are far more vulnerable. Life is pretty grim."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The Central African Republic, Papua New Guinea and Yemen join Sudan among the hardest-hit countries with immunization programs in dire straits. Two of those countries — Sudan and Yemen — &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2013/11/26/247297862/violence-increases-in-central-african-republic" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;are&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nrc.no/perspectives/2024/whats-happening-in-the-central-african-republic" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;active&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/pictureshow/2023/06/21/1183192685/yemeni-civil-war-frontline-photos" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;war zones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In all, &lt;a href="https://prezly.msf.org.uk/a-shot-at-life-how-to-reach-more-children-in-humanitarian-settings-with-lifesaving-vaccination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;about 55%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of unvaccinated kids live in conflict-affected areas. "Being a child growing up in those contexts, you've got the odds stacked up against you," says &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/southeastasia/news/events/detail/2025/06/03/south-east-asia-events/webinar-on-immunization-and-vaccine-research-area-prioritization-for-the-who-south-east-asia-region" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Naor Bar-Zeev&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;,&lt;/u&gt; a pediatrician and vaccine expert at the World Health Organization.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While vaccine experts note that vaccine hesitancy &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/10/1/6" target="_blank"&gt;exists&lt;/a&gt; in these regions, they say that's not the main reason that children &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09169-4" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;miss vaccinations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In most cases, it's either lack of awareness among caregivers or lack of access to health facilities.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It wasn't my choice not to vaccinate my child. It was war that prevented me," Fadul explains. "I would sell everything I have to get a vaccine."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The leading causes of infection among unvaccinated kids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The things we actually worry about are the horses rather than the zebras," &lt;a href="https://www.pediatrics.wisc.edu/staff/conway-james/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. James Conway&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says. Conway, a pediatric infectious disease expert at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, uses this metaphor to explain that while rare complications — zebras — can occur, it's important for physicians to first focus on preventing the most common causes of serious illness — the horses. "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure," Conway adds, noting this cliché is truer than ever in countries like Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2500/aap.2021.42.210065" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Two of those&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; "horses" are pneumococcal disease and rotavirus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pneumococcal disease often causes pneumonia, the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2013-204247" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;leading cause of death&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; worldwide for all children under 5, with an &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/pneumonia" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;annual toll&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of about 700,000.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rotavirus is the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciad060" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;most common culprit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for diarrhea in that same under age 5 group in lower resource countries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Conway says both are especially dangerous for kids living in crowded environments because those infections are more likely to spread and become dangerous once a child is exposed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Overcrowding enhances the transmission of respiratory infections like pneumococcal pneumonia because tight living conditions increase the frequency of person-to-person interactions. Densely populated areas often also have limited access to clean water and sanitation, which facilitates the spread of diarrheal diseases through contaminated water, food and surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's sort of like a bucket of gasoline just waiting for somebody to throw a match in," Conway explains. "All it takes is the introduction of one of these diseases."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Vaccines have been available for decades to prevent both pneumococcal disease and rotavirus. In many parts of the Global South, vaccination campaigns target both.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But in low-resource settings, "access to even basic medical care can be really compromised" because of conflict and other factors, Conway notes. And that would have an impact on vaccine uptake.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other factors that worsen outcomes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The millions of children who don't get vaccines may face other formidable challenges if they fall ill. Malnutrition &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-nutr-062122-014910" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reduces&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the production of cells used by the immune system to fight off infections, increasing the risk of disease. Various micronutrient deficiencies can also worsen outcomes. For instance, vitamin A deficiency &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra2504516" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;increases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the risk of severe complications and death from measles.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"As that battle rages, malnourished kids don't develop an appropriate immune response," Conway explains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Once infected, the body demands even more energy to fend off infection, leading to a vicious cycle. "These infections can progress rather quickly, especially in small babies," Conway says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pneumonia kills nearly three-quarters of a million kids a year&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Cough and difficulty breathing are usually the &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2017.9039" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;first signs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Once the microbe hijacks the body, it damages the lung tissue, making breathing more difficult. It's almost like trying to breathe through a sponge soaked with water.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When the lungs lose their ability to exchange gases, organs receive less oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Eventually, you succumb to the inability to breathe properly and oxygenate your blood," Conway says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As the infection &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccc.2017.08.005" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;overwhelms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the body, severe drops in blood pressure further starve vital organs of oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Studies have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2308.151550" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that some children die of pneumonia in as few as two days. "These things can progress rather, rather quickly," Conway says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The danger doesn't end with pneumonia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Looming over unvaccinated children is yet another deadly threat: diarrhea. It comes from many sources, but many kids get immunized against rotavirus — the leading cause of diarrhea in the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In high-income countries, diarrhea is fairly common but rarely life-threatening because of widespread access to clean water and sanitation, rehydration therapy and adequate nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The data look starker for children in the Global South. That's because patients with diarrhea are treated with oral rehydration. Conway says, "Oral rehydration is something that we take for granted, but it's really not readily available in a lot of these settings."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As with other infections, malnutrition worsens outcomes for kids with diarrhea. A large study &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001256" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;found&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that children with malnutrition and diarrhea were four times more likely to die compared with those with diarrhea and sufficient nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s2214-109x(20)30230-8" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Unreliable access&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to life-saving treatment and poor rotavirus vaccine coverage create a deadly combination. Diarrhea &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30114-8" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;accounts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for about one in 10 deaths among children under 5 in low-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ongoing diarrhea and vomiting can rapidly lead to dehydration. "We've all been dehydrated out hiking or doing something on a hot day, and you get a headache. Gradually, that transitions to being just more and more lethargic, where these kids just don't have the energy to move and do anything," Conway explains.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;If dehydration isn't treated, circulating blood volume and blood pressure plummet. As in pneumonia, the blood pressure drop deprives vital organs of oxygen. The body's balance of salts, acids and blood sugar is also disrupted, causing damage to organs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Once multiple organs cease to function, death is imminent. Depending on the child's health before the illness, death can occur "within a few days" or take a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"While the body will do everything possible to maintain blood flow and perfusion of the brain, that's the last thing that starts to suffer," Conway says. "This lethargy then goes into being unresponsive and can progress gradually to coma and then death."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lingering long-term side effects even after survival&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When resources like antibiotics and oral rehydration are available, some children will recover from vaccine-preventable diseases. But that doesn't mean a child will survive unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"As these viruses run throughout the body, any organ can suffer," Conway says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Measles, mumps and other vaccine-preventable diseases can cause debilitating and permanent damage. Conway says it's not the organism itself causing the damage, but rather the immune response to the microbe.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Hearing loss is one of the most devastating consequences of measles and mumps, causing deafness in &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMra2504516" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;5 to 10%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of cases. The complication is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2188/jea.je20200233" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;rarer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with mumps.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There are quite a few nerves in the body that are quite fine fibers and very susceptible to damage," Conway explains. "Oftentimes, the most vulnerable nerves are the ones that take a hit, and the nerves that impact hearing are really, really vulnerable."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Other complications &lt;a href="http://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMra2504516" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;include&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; infertility and blindness. Conway added that intellectual disability is another risk because these infections attack the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Nerves are one of the parts of the body that don't recover quickly," Conway says. "You can rebuild lung tissue over time if you survive one of these infections, but nerve tissue just doesn't regrow and replace itself, so many kids do end up with neurologic deficits."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some kids get vaccine-preventable diseases even before they're born&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Newborns can also suffer if their mother isn't immunized against diseases like measles, mumps and rubella. Ideally, pregnant people should receive all recommended vaccines — but there may not be &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2022.11.039" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;funding&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for adult immunization. "This idea of immunizing adolescents and adults is just not as common in the Global South," Conway explains.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And if the pregnant person does not have immunity to a virus like &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/-/media/project/acog/acogorg/clinical/files/committee-opinion/articles/2019/01/prepregnancy-counseling.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;measles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they're at risk of getting infected. That can lead to miscarriage, fetal death or stillbirth&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another harmful pathogen is rubella — an infection that has some symptoms in common with measles but is generally less severe.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If the fetus survives an early rubella infection, some babies are born with a constellation of birth defects known as congenital rubella syndrome, which can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/risa.12264" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;include&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; deafness, cataracts, congenital heart disease and neurodevelopmental impairment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The birthing process also poses dangers. Pregnant people &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/-/media/project/acog/acogorg/clinical/files/committee-opinion/articles/2017/09/update-on-immunization-and-pregnancy-tetanus-diphtheria-and-pertussis-vaccination.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;should receive&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a dose of the tetanus vaccine during each pregnancy. But if the person giving birth doesn't have immunity to tetanus, non-sterile delivery practices can result in neonatal tetanus. From 2000 to 2020, cases &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7111a2" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;decreased&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by 88% worldwide, with 2,229 being reported in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Neonatal tetanus is heartbreaking," Conway notes. "These babies are incapable of doing anything on their own. They're incapable of breathing on their own because all the muscles in their body are contracted."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The emotional toll of missing vaccines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A shadow of guilt follows Fadul, the mother from Sudan. Despite the ongoing war making vaccines scarce, she blames herself for not being able to protect her son.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I was sad because I knew we would never get a vaccine," she recounts. "There was no light at the end of the tunnel."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some of the stress &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228435" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;experienced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by parents comes from seeing the devastating effects of vaccine-preventable diseases in their communities, and sometimes in their own children, as with Fadul.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"There is this sense of complacency in the U.S.," Conway says. "Once the system is sort of humming along and working well, a lot of these diseases do fade into the background. When you go into lower-resourced areas, there's still familiarity with these diseases."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There is still an appreciation of vaccines. People not only welcome them, but they demand that their kids get immunized," Conway explains. "Parents, especially mothers, are very wired toward being protective. There's a natural, expected stress that happens when you can't provide whatever it is that your kid needs."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Conway thinks that sense of maternal stress is valid. The first 1,000 days of a child's life — a term &lt;a href="https://thousanddays.org/about/our-story/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;popularized&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the early 2010s to describe the importance of the first two years of life — are some of the most vulnerable periods for growth and development.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The first 1,000 days are really, in many ways, going to determine sort of who and what you are," Conway says. "That's part of the reason that I think the support of aid agencies is so critical in these disrupted situations."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This year's &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/03/28/g-s1-56881/vaccines-gavi-usaid-rubio" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cuts in U.S. funds&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for programs like Gavi, the Vaccine alliance, paint an unclear picture of how Sudan and other countries will handle the many obstacles being thrown their way.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Fadul's son is now weakened by infection and hunger, though still alive, but she fears he can slip over the edge at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Parents in America have never seen what I have. I've seen kids die in front of me," Fadul says tearfully. "I don't want another child right now. This would mean two unvaccinated kids. I want to have another child when I know they'll be safe. But life is not stopping in Sudan. Every hour, women are still giving birth. These children will face the same problem my son faced. I hope that one day these children will no longer suffer."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

About 2,500 students attend the school in grades nine through 12. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials in Wake County, the county in which the school is located, said the person, who was not publicly identified, was present at the school sometime last week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services Division of Public Health said it is working with Wake County Schools to identify and notify anyone who may have had close contact with the person. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/world-health-organization/index.html" id="mol-ec98b1f0-8cb3-11f0-91c6-31447f8d929e" class=""&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; considers tuberculosis to be the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14540025/Woman-contracts-deadliest-virus-wrong-vaccine.html"&gt;deadliest disease in the world&lt;/a&gt; because it kills the most people of any disease, claiming about 1.25million lives every year, mostly in developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Announcement of the North Carolina comes just a few days after &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/maine/index.html" id="mol-ec99ea70-8cb3-11f0-91c6-31447f8d929e"&gt;Maine&lt;/a&gt; officials reported three people in the state tested positive for TB. There was no connection between the patients, suggesting each was infected by a different source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They were located in the Greater Portland area, officials said, and work is now underway to identify and isolate their close contacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There has been a recent uptick in TB cases in the US, with America reporting 10,347 infections in 2024, the most recent year available, up eight percent from the year before and the highest tally since 2011 when there were 10,471 cases recorded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An active case of tuberculosis was reported in someone at Leesville High School in Raleigh, North Carolina (pictured above)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The names and ages of the patients have not been revealed. The above shows a chest X-ray of a person with tuberculosis (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Officials say the risk to the public is low, however. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;North Carolina's CBS17 reported that parents of students in the high school received a notice from the Wake County Health Department’s Communicable Disease division informing them of 'a situation affecting our school.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The notice did not reveal the 'situation' was a case of TB, but said anyone exposed would be contacted by county officials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;TB was confirmed on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A county spokesperson said in an email to CBS 17: 'We have been notified that an individual with active tuberculosis was present at Leesville [Road] High School last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We are working with Wake County Public School System to identify anyone who may have been in close contact with this person. Those individuals will be contacted directly with instructions for tuberculosis testing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, there were 215 TB cases in the state in 2023, the latest confirmed data available. This was an increase from 164 cases in 2022 and the highest in nearly a decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Preliminary CDC data recorded 250 TB cases in North Carolina last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So far in 2025, there have been 128 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;TB has a high fatality rate, killing up to half of patients if left untreated or unvaccinated. That's far above the fatality rate for Covid, below one percent, measles, 10 percent for untreated patients, and Legionnaire's disease, also around 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tuberculosis was effectively a death sentence in the 18th and 19th centuries when there was no cure, although it can now be prevented by vaccines and treated with antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tuberculosis killed more than 16,000 people in the US every year in the 1950s, but deaths have now dropped 28-fold to around 550 people annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tuberculosis infections are on the rise in the US, and nationwide have now reached their highest tally since 2011&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most tuberculosis cases in the US are imported or due to migration into the country, the CDC says, with most patients coming from outside America's borders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further details on the North Carolina and Maine cases, including names, ages and exact locations were not revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Dora Anne Mills, chief health improvement officer for MaineHealth, warned that tuberculosis could only be passed on if someone was in 'close, prolonged contact' with an infectious person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told the Portland Press Herald: 'The vast majority of people do not need to worry about this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's not spread through casual contact like shaking hands or sharing a towel. It's much less contagious than influenza or Covid.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can take days for the disease to infect a healthy person who lives in the same home as a patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maine has already reported 28 cases of tuberculosis so far this year, figures show, just 11 cases below the 39 recorded in all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Children, older adults and those with weaker immune systems are more vulnerable to an infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the early stages, symptoms of the disease include a persistent and unexplained cough and sometimes coughing up blood or chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients may also suffer from unexplained weight loss, loss of appetite, fever and night sweats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In later stages, patients may have severe breathing difficulties, extensive lung damage and the infection may spread to other organs like the liver or back, causing pain in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Patients die from the disease due to respiratory failure, or when damage to the lungs means they can no longer get enough oxygen into the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors can treat the disease with antibiotics and can vaccinate against the disease using a shot called the BCG vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is not routinely offered in the US, because the disease is not common, but can be requested for children, and leaves a small circular scar on the arm, a normal response and sign that the vaccine was effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also be given to adults, but it is less effective in this group and may lead to someone falsely testing positive for the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In developing countries, the vaccine is administered to children under the age of 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Six months after the intervention, 50% of participants were in remission and 80% showed a clinically meaningful response. The antidepressant effects began to wane after 9 months. The study was published in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2025.119655"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Affective Disorders&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression is a mental health disorder characterized by persistent sadness, loss of interest, low energy, and difficulty functioning in daily life. It can impact mood, cognition, and physical well-being, often interfering with work, relationships, and quality of life. Standard treatments include antidepressant medications, psychotherapy, or a combination of both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, many individuals fail to improve with these interventions. When someone does not respond to at least two adequate trials of different antidepressants, their condition is referred to as treatment-resistant depression (TRD). People with TRD tend to experience more severe, longer-lasting depressive episodes and are at greater risk for chronic impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health professionals often try various strategies for TRD, such as switching medications, combining drugs, or augmenting antidepressants with other agents like antipsychotics or mood stabilizers. However, these alternatives often provide limited relief. As a result, researchers continue to explore more effective options—including psychedelic compounds such as psilocybin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Sara Ellis and her colleagues note that previous studies have shown short-term benefits of psilocybin for depression, but few have examined how long those effects last. Their study sought to track changes in depression symptoms over a 12-month period following a single dose of psilocybin in a group of military veterans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound found in certain species of mushrooms, often referred to as “magic mushrooms.” In medical research, psilocybin is being studied for its potential to treat conditions such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and addiction. When administered in a controlled setting with psychological support, clinical trials suggest psilocybin may produce rapid and lasting improvements. However, it can also cause adverse effects such as distressing hallucinations, anxiety, confusion, and nausea, and it remains a controlled substance in many jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this pilot study, the researchers followed 10 U.S. military veterans diagnosed with severe treatment-resistant depression. Although the sample size was small, military veterans represent a high-risk group for depression, particularly forms that are resistant to treatment, making the study especially relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before dosing, participants took part in two 60-minute and one 90-minute preparatory therapy sessions. On the dosing day, they each received a single 25 mg capsule of psilocybin. Sessions were conducted at Stanford University School of Medicine with two licensed therapists present, lasting 6 to 8 hours. Participants’ vital signs were monitored before and after dosing. The next day, they participated in a 90-minute integration session, followed by at least two additional integration sessions—one during the first week and one at 12 weeks post-treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were assessed for depressive symptoms, anxiety, and functional impairment at multiple timepoints up to 12 months after dosing. Measures included the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS), and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). They also completed the Five-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness scale to assess their psychedelic experience, and safety and tolerability were monitored throughout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed a significant reduction in depression scores across all timepoints. At 6 months, 50% of participants met criteria for remission—meaning their symptoms were minimal or absent—and 80% experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the antidepressant effects began to fade after 6 months. By 12 months, 40% of participants still met response criteria and 30% remained in remission. While scores were higher than at 3 or 12 weeks post-treatment, they were still significantly lower than at baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In this first-of-kind study on long-term effects of psilocybin for Veterans with severe TRD [treatment-resistant depression], depression scores showed significant sustained reductions up to 12-months. However, the antidepressant effects began to wane at 6 months, and then more substantially after 9 months, although these increases in MADRS did not reach statistical significance. Further research is needed,” the study authors concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study adds to growing evidence that psilocybin may offer long-term benefits for depression, especially in populations that have not responded to conventional treatments. However, the study had several important limitations. It did not include a control group, and participants were aware they were receiving psilocybin, which raises the possibility of expectancy effects or placebo responses. This introduces the potential for the Hawthorne effect, in which individuals change their behavior because they know they are being observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without a control condition, it is difficult to determine how much of the observed improvement is due to psilocybin itself, and how much might be attributed to psychological support, natural symptom fluctuations, or other factors. The small sample size further limits the generalizability of the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2025.119655"&gt;Long-term outcomes of single-dose psilocybin for U.S. military Veterans with severe treatment-resistant depression – 12-month data from an open-label pilot study&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Sara Ellis, Catherine Bostian, Anna Donnelly, Wendy Feng, Katherine Eisen, Melanie Lean, Elizabeth Conlan, Michael Ostacher, Scott Aaronson, and Trisha Suppes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 14:11:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQWUptRHIyYWtyZ1VDLXU1VUNqbTN6QklBM2ZPWW5mOWZhTjd3VWtZcFpBOFlxM29nV0pxb3k1akt1U1AtSDhtTTkwT056a1JGY2JmcS04YTQ5UFBBZWt4NzFKMXRZaXpWYjFTemdaXzNTNEE1bnRlRGNqM3JDSjhuTGVQMjdydzZKOXBsS3FnZENuVnVLMUxWdnFrM0Ixa3V5b2lMeEJSTmtla29XTHQ1T3FHX0R6djVq</guid></item><item><title>小RFK认为冠状病毒疫苗的批评者将加入关键的疫苗小组-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/09/08/rfk-jr-new-vaccine-advisers/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4CPHUKZRQNEZ3HSYGI5SQRUULM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

However, I made a cup of coffee, sat at my desk and did a little digging to see if it was all too good to be true, or if there was some actual truth to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="189181d7-60c4-4480-b2d5-e81a672fcd0f-2"&gt;Here’s everything you need to know about the study and how you could boost longevity in as little as one minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-531259a1-68cc-4005-8105-23c2f2f7fb5b" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-study-3"&gt;What is the study?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="4f3894db-c4a3-48c2-a517-a8369aa84f7b"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="08e02e9c-e700-41f6-b451-01e1864c2603"&gt;Research published in&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.05.25333017v1" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.05.25333017v1" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; MedRxiv &lt;/a&gt;as recently as 2025 shows that you can stay healthy using vigorous intermittent lifestyle physical activity (VILPA) during everyday life. And, it will contribute toward your weekly recommended target of 150 to 300 minutes of "moderate-vigorous" activity per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is to accrue physical activity with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-exercise-snacking-every-day-for-a-week-here-are-3-ways-it-changed-my-workouts" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-exercise-snacking-every-day-for-a-week-here-are-3-ways-it-changed-my-workouts"&gt;exercise snacking&lt;/a&gt; in short bouts when you get time during the day. It’s time-efficient, saves you the effort of heading to the gym and helps break up sedentary time spent sitting for prolonged periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of mindset, it could also be beneficial for those struggling with motivation or getting back into exercise following an injury, pregnancy or health condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise snacking isn’t a new concept, but the research gets pretty specific on what you need to do to benefit from a short burst of vigorous physical activity here and there to help you plan it — without planning it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-RJdQQbLM7HbTh374G3qvm8" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-RJdQQbLM7HbTh374G3qvm8 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure id="de89c79a-a83b-4e2e-94e6-ee97d8cc3266"&gt;&lt;blockquote class="vanilla-quoteblock"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is to accrue physical activity with exercise snacking in short bouts when you get time during the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="6ffda1cb-1474-4ac9-98a8-ee5b8e6c1ec8"&gt;The study examined the association between VILPA and mortality risk in a “nationally representative sample” of 3,293 US adults who self-reported that they didn’t participate in “structured exercise” regimes. Participants wore accelerometers on their wrists, and bouts of VILPA activity lasted &lt;em&gt;up to&lt;/em&gt; one minute. Effects were studied over years rather than weeks or months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-2d35bc3a-ca34-4a5d-82f5-133c01f81ddb" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-results-3"&gt;What are the results?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="519c616f-6aaa-4b04-bb01-c272db00599f"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Kikostock/Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="3cf3d433-344e-4ffb-8a78-3a79790c3afa"&gt;In total, 290 all-cause mortality events occurred over the follow-up period of several years. Just over five bouts per day was associated with a 44% lower risk of all-cause mortality, with a tapering off at around eight bouts per day. As for how long you’d need to perform vigorous exercise, 1.1 minutes total is suggested as best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers concluded that these short bursts spread throughout the day could have meaningful health benefits, and you can break these up into 10-second or 20-second stints, if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-ee4fb8df-4c5a-47db-a895-4fd53df3211d" data-url="" href="" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="verdict-what-does-this-mean-for-you-3"&gt;Verdict: What does this mean for you?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check id="9c788a88-0362-4105-8284-91dccfb057b3"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty/martin-dm)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="e4f6afef-5bd8-4254-9baa-376d6b4d4f19"&gt;According to the researchers, just 60 seconds of exercise that barely registers as a workout could increase your lifespan and boost your health. Not only are you breaking up sedentary time, which is crucial for lowering your risk of developing chronic health conditions as you age, but you’re also accruing movement during the day while still raising your heart rate and increasing circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of that, vigorous movement works your muscles, bones and joints and strengthens them. Overall, this could help prevent muscle atrophy and bone mass loss while keeping you safe from injury. Strengthening your cardiovascular system can help manage conditions such as high cholesterol or diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re unsure what types of activities to consider, you could try &lt;strong&gt;brisk walking&lt;/strong&gt; the next time you approach a hill, &lt;strong&gt;run around with your dog&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;walk home with your groceries&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;briskly take the stairs &lt;/strong&gt;rather than the elevator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the walkers, I recommend &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/fart-walking-is-trending-heres-everything-you-need-to-know" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/fart-walking-is-trending-heres-everything-you-need-to-know"&gt;fart walking &lt;/a&gt;after a meal or the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-followed-the-japanese-walking-method-for-30-days-heres-what-happened-to-my-back-pain-and-energy-levels" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-followed-the-japanese-walking-method-for-30-days-heres-what-happened-to-my-back-pain-and-energy-levels"&gt;Japanese Walking Method&lt;/a&gt; to add intervals into your walks. &lt;strong&gt;Bikers might consider a faster pedal or sprint&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;gardeners could add some digging or loading heavy wheelbarrow walks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All you need to do is add a bit of intensity to the existing chores you already complete. No need to overthink it; need to grab something from the car? Why not run to do it? The next time you see a staircase, why not perform some &lt;strong&gt;jumps or push-ups&lt;/strong&gt; on it? Even stopping during your walk and &lt;strong&gt;performing 10-20 squats or push-ups &lt;/strong&gt;could count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as with everything in life, the best results come from consistency, so be sure to complete 60-second bursts during the day, daily. If you can add more activity, like gentle jogging, resistance training, yoga, or Pilates, all are great at making you fitter, stronger and more mobile as you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="e1397cf8-739f-4b4b-b8b3-85821d8e4282"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Follow &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US%3Aen" target="_blank" data-url="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqKAgKIiJDQklTRXdnTWFnOEtEWFJ2YlhObmRXbGtaUzVqYjIwb0FBUAE?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US%3Aen" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom's Guide on Google News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get our up-to-date news, how-tos, and reviews in your feeds.

            Parents typically handle every aspect of their kid’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;health care, whether it’s booking appointments, talking to the doctor or doling out prescription medications. Maybe this works fine — until that kid leaves home to go to college or work and ends up in an urgent care in the middle of the night with raging flu symptoms or a broken wrist.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6zdie7000p3b6nssyrk4gn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An estimated 3.9 million students graduate from high school in 2025, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.wiche.edu/resources/report-u-s-high-school-graduates-will-peak-next-year-then-most-states-will-see-steady-declines-through-2041/" target="_blank"&gt;Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education&lt;/a&gt;. In my experience, most of them are not ready to handle their health care as adults.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6zdie7000q3b6n6ivw4z7x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many of these graduates will join the &lt;a href="https://www.validatedinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Higher-Ed-Insights-August-2025-v1.0-1.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;18.4 million students&lt;/a&gt; already in college as of the spring semester. Nearly 72% of college students say they have seen a medical provider in the past year, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.acha.org/wp-content/uploads/NCHA-IIIb_SPRING_2024_REFERENCE_GROUP_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Spring 2024 National College Health Assessment&lt;/a&gt;, so chances are your teen will need to visit a doctor at some point,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;too﻿.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6zdie7000r3b6n9be4bf89@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whether in college or not, your now-adult child needs to learn the skills to take over their own health care. As a family physician focused on young adult health, I want to share my prescription for handling health care at any age.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6zdie7000s3b6n5d67zqoo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Every health care visit starts with the front desk person asking for your identification, health insurance card (if you have insurance) and medical information. Keep pictures of the front and back of your insurance card marked as favorites on your phone. Create an accessible file (like a Google Doc) that lists all your medications (with doses), drug allergies, past medical problems and surgeries, family history, and immunization record. (You can even carry the physical insurance card.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6zdie7000t3b6nrzkdm7ml@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Before you hand over your card, though, consider who pays for the insurance. The policyholder (usually the parent or guardian if you are a teen or young adult) will receive an explanation of benefits, or EOB, after any visit when you use insurance.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6zdie7000u3b6nrinyrtab@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not a bill, but an explanation of your office visit charges. Diagnoses aren’t included, but the EOB does list the names of lab tests, procedures or imaging from the appointment. If a test for pregnancy, sexually transmissible diseases or drugs turns up, your parents can connect the dots.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6zdie7000v3b6nvb6dus4s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And no, the doctor cannot label a chlamydia screening “strep throat test.” That’s insurance fraud. If you are concerned about your parents knowing the reason for your visit, consider going to a public or student clinic with discounted fees for noninsured visits. Universities almost always have free or low-cost STD clinics for their students.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6zdie7000w3b6ncc66wlc3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Why did you make this appointment? Patients often wait until the doctor is standing up to leave before blurting out their real concern, which is typically a sensitive or time-consuming problem, such as wanting to start birth control, having painful periods, or worrying about pregnancy or STDs. Or maybe you have a mental health issue like insomnia, anxiety, depression or addiction.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6zdie7000x3b6n201xpwuz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            With today’s office visits often limited to 10 or 15 minutes, both you and your doctor want to make the most of your time together. Start with your main concern, even if it feels awkward or embarrassing to you. Trust me, the doctor has heard and seen it all before and wants the maximum amount of time to address your problem.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6zdie7000y3b6n3cvb4d97@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In my experience, the No. 1 factor in patient dissatisfaction with a doctor visit is not understanding what to do next if the problem gets worse or isn’t resolving. Never leave the exam room without asking, “What’s next?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6zdie7000z3b6nohca7hbm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Clarify when and how you will hear your test results: what you should do if you have a bad reaction or aren’t getting better; what time frame is reasonable to expect improvement; and how to effectively communicate back with any concerns (usually through the online patient portal).
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6zdie700103b6ng3cxdpt1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People often tell me they went to the doctor and got a prescription, therapy or imaging that didn’t help or didn’t identify their problem. When I ask what the doctor said when they followed up, it turns out they never went back or communicated with the office.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6zdie700113b6non5zx1to@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            We joke that it’s the “practice of medicine,” but it’s true that our initial diagnosis or therapy isn’t always right. We always have a plan B, C and D. Your doctor can’t know you’re not better if you don’t let them know. Please follow up.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6zdie700123b6nqn4l5haa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Your doctor has no way of knowing your personal cost for medications unless you are skipping insurance and paying cash, and we’re not good at guessing. Only 1 in 5 doctors accurately predicted their patients’ out-of-pocket costs, according to a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2785905" target="_blank"&gt;2021 JAMA investigation&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6zdie700133b6n2f0s7w3j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you get to the pharmacy counter to pick up your prescription and find out the medicine is incredibly expensive, you have choices. Ask whether a generic equivalent is available, and if so, ask the pharmacy to contact your doctor for a less expensive alternative. (The pharmacist may ask you to call yourself, but they often do it themselves.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6zdie700143b6nf85js6xl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Never hesitate to speak up! Doctors may assume a decades-old generic medication is inexpensive, yet insurance formularies may make this traditional drug an overpriced option.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6zdie700153b6nlnqkbz8n@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If your doctor prescribes a medication with refills, do not wait until you’re on your last pill to renew it. Pharmacies can take several days or more to refill a medication, so when you pick up a prescription, put a reminder in your phone to request your next routine refill at least three days before it is due.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6zdie700163b6nmdcc21o9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Medications for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;have been especially delayed in the past couple of years, subject not only to the required physician approval but also increasing demand, pipeline delays and supply shortages. In 2023, more than 7 in 10 adults in the US who were prescribed stimulant ADHD medications had problems filling their prescriptions because the medications were unavailable, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/pdfs/mm7340a1-H.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;2024 data&lt;/a&gt; from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6zdie700173b6nb38xp7lz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Let me apologize in advance: I know it’s irritating when you are asked the same questions multiple times, both in person and through online forms. Know that this is not anyone questioning the validity of your answers, but everyone making sure we focus your visit on your chief complaint instead.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6zdie700183b6nkgasc690@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            First, asking the same questions creates a safety net because consistency will catch errors. Second, answers change because nervous patients may vary their responses as they move through the system. Third, when the doctor is running late, it can be more efficient to ask the patient rather than read the receptionist’s and medical assistant’s notes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6zdie700193b6n6e1vre5m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Parents should not be saying, “Go get an antibiotic for that cough you’ve had for a month,” or “You need an X-ray of your ankle or a CT scan of your head.” It is not helpful. Nearly half of American adults say it’s difficult to afford health care costs, &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-costs/americans-challenges-with-health-care-costs/" target="_blank"&gt;according to KFF&lt;/a&gt;, yet patients continue to demand treatments, imaging and procedures that are not needed based on evidence-based guidelines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6zdie7001a3b6ney22mrx2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most respiratory illnesses and post-viral coughs do not improve with antibiotics (because they are not caused by bacteria), and most “sprained” ankles do not require X-rays. Nothing is wrong with encouraging your teen or young adult to head to the doctor, but please don’t set firm diagnostic or treatment expectations unless you are also a medical professional.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmf6zdie7001b3b6nelssvapi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Health care adulting doesn’t mean needing to know everything before you see a doctor, but being prepared, speaking up and asking the right follow-up questions will go a long way toward getting better care. Learning these important skills takes practice to feel comfortable at any age, but doing so will help turn intimidating medical appointments into more efficient and productive — and less stressful — visits.

&lt;p&gt;The group brings together hundreds of grandparents nationwide who lived through diseases such as polio, tuberculosis and measles — illnesses once thought eliminated in the United States, according to leadership council member Teri Mills.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch comes as measles cases surge to their highest levels since the disease was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000. &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/ivac/2025/us-measles-cases-hit-highest-level-since-declared-eliminated-in-2000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Data from Johns Hopkins&lt;/a&gt; shows more than 1,400 measles cases have been reported so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mills, a grandmother and nurse, said the group wants to educate younger generations about the reality of vaccine-preventable diseases.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I have a very vivid recollection of having measles and how awful that was," Mills said. "We're really trying to share our own stories of what it was like for our generation when we had these infectious diseases. We just feel like our children haven't seen these diseases, they don't think they exist."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing coincides with the 70th anniversary of the polio vaccine announcement on April 12, 1955, when Jonas Salk's vaccine was declared "safe, effective, and potent" — a breakthrough that transformed public health.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mills said many parents and grandparents felt tremendous relief when vaccines became available for deadly diseases like polio. The group plans to host events, panels and campaigns to raise awareness about vaccination importance.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organization is free to join and aims to bridge the generational gap between those who experienced vaccine-preventable diseases and younger parents who may not understand their severity.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With flu season approaching and measles cases continuing to climb, the group's message about vaccination could prove particularly timely for Oregon families.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

When it comes to strokes, every minute counts," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Some of the most commonly dismissed symptoms of a possible stroke include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="mb-4"&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sudden, unexplained nausea or vomiting: &lt;/strong&gt;“If you feel nauseated or vomit suddenly, without explanation, and especially if it’s paired with dizziness or imbalance, don’t ignore it,” Shapiro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A “thunderclap” headache that comes out of nowhere&lt;/strong&gt;: This type of headache is typically sudden, severe and hits you “like a lightning bolt,” Shapiro said. “Even if you don’t have other stroke symptoms, this kind of headache warrants immediate attention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One-limb numbness, not weakness&lt;/strong&gt;: This may feel like a “weird dead-arm feeling” or numbness. This symptom is often dismissed because patients say they can still move their limbs, Shapiro said, but sensory changes on one side can be an early sign of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vertigo or sudden loss of balance&lt;/strong&gt;: Shapiro said this is a major cause of misdiagnosis in young women having strokes, sometimes dismissed as an inner ear issue, anxiety or dehydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sudden fatigue or mental fog&lt;/strong&gt;: “Brain fog, confusion or extreme fatigue are red flags when they strike suddenly and don’t go away with rest,” Shapiro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bethany Fonseca poses with her dog, Koba, at a heart walk held in Metropolitan Park in Jacksonville, Florida in September 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;span class="exclude-from-newsgate"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ozempic? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/10/21/stroke-ozempic-new-prevention-guidance/75774688007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:New guidance for stroke prevention includes weight loss drugs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;New guidance for stroke prevention includes weight loss drugs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Young adults should also be aware of factors that put them at higher risk of having a stroke, such as high blood pressure, smoking, high cholesterol, diabetes, drug abuse and binge drinking, Shapiro said. Women who take birth control pills or are pregnant may also face an increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After her stroke, Fonseca lost control of the right side of her body and needed weeks of physical and occupational therapy. It took her a month to learn how to drive again and a full year to feel like herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nearly 15 years later, Fonseca still has trouble with balance and fatigue, but she counts herself lucky. In Brooks Rehabilitation, she saw how strokes caused lifelong disability for many patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It’s still a daily struggle but some people aren’t as lucky as I am,” she said. “If all I have to worry about is balance and tiredness, I count my blessings because it’s so much worse for other people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bethany Fonseca poses with her twin daughters, Karleigh and Kayleigh Fonseca, at an American Heart Association event in January 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adrianna Rodriguez can be reached at adrodriguez@usatoday.com. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/09/08/stroke-symptoms-millennials-gen-z/85989051007/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Stroke at 27: One woman shares her story and a warning;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Stroke at 27: One woman shares her story and a warning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News UK</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 12:08:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBsdEFkM0tkczc4LXV6N0Jubmt3VW13R3VKeWhwTHhLRElFWHN4Zlc0T3pVZV9yU3loZXEzXzkyME1PcDRBbzZZWXJDb01iRk1sVERFSE0zejVvcGxjenk2b3Z4RGVGWFd5QTJQT0VVcEx0RHNN</guid></item><item><title>如果您超过70岁，仍然在没有帮助的情况下完成这8项体力劳动，那么您比90%的人衰老得更好- VegOut</title><link>https://vegoutmag.com/lifestyle/s-if-youre-over-70-and-still-do-these-8-physical-tasks-without-help-youre-aging-better-than-90-of-people/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page__content mt-4"&gt;
							&lt;p&gt;The medical establishment loves to measure aging through clinical tests—bone density scans, cognitive assessments, blood panels with numbers that mean nothing to most of us. But the real measure of how well you're aging happens in the mundane moments: reaching for a jar on the top shelf, getting up from a low chair, or walking up stairs without gripping the rail like it's the only thing between you and disaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These everyday movements are what gerontologists call &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12215002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;activities of daily living&lt;/a&gt;, and they're better predictors of healthy aging than most medical metrics. If you're over 70 and can still do these eight things without help, you're not just getting older—you're mastering the art of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Getting up from the floor without using your hands&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't about yoga flexibility or showing off at family gatherings. The ability to rise from the floor without hand support is what researchers call the &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurjpc/advance-article/doi/10.1093/eurjpc/zwaf325/8163161" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sitting-rising test&lt;/a&gt;, and it predicts longevity better than many elaborate medical exams. It requires leg strength, core stability, and the kind of coordination that typically abandons us first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch how most people over 70 get up from the floor—it's a production involving furniture, grunting, and often a helping hand. Those who can still pop up using just their legs have maintained the muscle mass that melts away at roughly 8% per decade after age 30. They've essentially slowed their biological clock through the simple act of continuing to move like they always have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Carrying groceries up a flight of stairs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This combines the two things aging bodies struggle with most: carrying weight and climbing. It's not just about strength—it's about cardiovascular efficiency meeting functional power. Your heart has to pump harder while your legs push against both gravity and the extra weight of those shopping bags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who bound up stairs with groceries in both hands aren't just physically capable—they've maintained the confidence that comes from knowing their body won't betray them. That psychological component might be even more important than the physical one. Fear of falling makes us move tentatively, and tentative movement becomes weak movement. It's a vicious cycle that those still hauling groceries upstairs have managed to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Standing on one foot for 30 seconds with eyes closed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balance is the invisible foundation of independence, and it deteriorates so gradually we don't notice until it's gone. This simple test reveals whether your proprioception—your body's sense of where it is in space—is still firing properly. Close your eyes and suddenly you're relying on inner ear fluid and muscle memory rather than visual cues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people over 70 can't manage ten seconds, let alone thirty. Those who can have maintained the neural pathways that connect brain to body, the constant micro-adjustments that keep us upright. They've probably never stopped challenging their balance, whether through dancing, gardening, or simply refusing to sit still. Balance isn't just physical—it's proof your nervous system is still engaged in the full-time job of keeping you vertical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. Opening a new jar without tools or help&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is about grip strength, which sounds minor until you realize it predicts overall mortality better than blood pressure. That stubborn pickle jar is actually testing the complex interplay of forearm muscles, finger tendons, and the kind of rotational force that weakens dramatically with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it's also about problem-solving under pressure. People who can still open jars haven't just maintained physical strength—they've kept the determination to wrestle with the world rather than immediately seeking assistance. They approach stuck lids as puzzles rather than impossibilities, trying different angles, using their shirt for grip, employing the physics of thermal expansion with hot water. The jar is just a jar, but opening it represents staying engaged with physical challenges rather than surrendering to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Walking a mile without resting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mile is nothing until it's everything. For many over 70, walking this distance without stopping has become as daunting as running a marathon once seemed. It requires cardiovascular endurance, joint health, and the mental fortitude to keep going when sitting down sounds much more appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who still walk a mile without thinking about it have usually never stopped walking. They're the ones who chose the far parking spot, took the dog around the block twice, walked to the store when they could have driven. They understand intuitively what research confirms: walking speed is one of the most reliable indicators of healthy aging. A mile without resting isn't just about endurance—it's about maintaining the freedom to go where you want, when you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Getting in and out of a bathtub safely&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bathtub is where independence goes to die. It combines slippery surfaces, high sides, and the need to balance on one foot—essentially an obstacle course designed by someone who hates old people. Many over 70 have already surrendered to shower chairs or walk-in tubs, practical adaptations that nevertheless mark a retreat from full physical capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who still step confidently over the tub's edge possess flexibility, strength, and coordination working in harmony. They've maintained the hip flexibility to lift their leg high enough, the core strength to balance during the transition, and the confidence that their body will do what they ask. It's a daily act of faith in their own physical competence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. Trimming your own toenails&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sounds trivial until you try it at 75. It requires spinal flexibility, hip mobility, balance, and the hand strength to operate clippers at an awkward angle. It's geometry and gymnastics combined, a test of whether you can still reach your own feet—something that seemed automatic for the first 60 years of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who still handle their own pedicures have maintained the full range of motion that lets them tie shoes, pick things up off the floor, and generally navigate a world designed for flexible bodies. They haven't yet entered the phase where basic self-care requires scheduling appointments or asking for help. It's dignity measured in the ability to reach your own toes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. Doing a full day of yard work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't about having a perfect lawn—it's about having the stamina for sustained physical activity. Yard work combines bending, lifting, pushing, pulling, and the endurance to keep going when muscles start complaining. It's functional fitness in its purest form, the kind that can't be replicated in a gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The septuagenarians who still spend Saturday mornings pushing mowers and Sunday afternoons raking leaves have maintained what researchers call work capacity—the ability to sustain moderate effort over time. They're tired at the end, sure, but it's the good tired that comes from accomplishment rather than the bone-deep exhaustion that makes others hire landscapers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These eight tasks aren't about proving anything to anyone else. They're about maintaining the physical vocabulary that lets you write your own story rather than having it dictated by limitation. The people over 70 who can still do these things haven't discovered some secret supplement or exercise routine. They've simply refused to stop doing what they've always done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real lesson isn't that everyone over 70 should be attempting these tasks—bodies age differently, and there's no shame in needing help. It's that the best predictor of what you'll be able to do tomorrow is what you're doing today. Every jar you open, every flight of stairs you climb, every time you get up from the floor, you're making a small deposit in your future mobility account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those aging better than their peers understand something fundamental: you don't lose these abilities all at once. You lose them by surrendering them one at a time, each concession seeming reasonable until suddenly you're surrounded by things you can no longer do. The trick isn't to fight aging—it's to keep moving through it, one ordinary task at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

She has struggled with frequent illness ever since first contracting Covid in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Ever since then, I just catch everything,” she said. Though she expressed her frustrations with a weakened immune system, she had her doubts that she would qualify for vaccine coverage under the new guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Her immediate worry is simple: not being bedridden on the day she says “I do”. “Weddings are expensive, and I don’t want to be sick that day if I can prevent it, and so I just want to get the vaccine,” she said. “I’ve gotten my booster every year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Yet the new rules have complicated what was once routine. Instead of stopping by CVS, as she has in past years, Heckle found herself on the phone with her insurer, navigating coverage questions and learning she’d need to go to a different pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I just am really hoping that I don’t have to risk being sick on my wedding day,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Though she was relieved to find out her vaccine would still be covered in some capacity, she’s still worried that her wedding – attended by people of all age groups – will likely host a significant number of guests who won’t be vaccinated. She doesn’t want anyone to get sick because they were there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I don’t know how many of the people who will be at my wedding are trying to get vaccinated, or how many qualify,” she said. “It just feels like it’s so much more complicated than it’s ever been before to get a vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For 18-year-old student Zeke Fraser-Plant, the new guidelines heightened concerns he already carries daily. His parents and a close friend continue to live with long-term effects from contracting Covid: “My father has a lot of problems with brain fog. My mother loses her sense of smell completely. It comes back off and on.” His friend, who caught Covid as a teenager, struggles with memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Fraser-Plant’s his biggest fear has just been made stronger. “I’m absolutely terrified that I might kill somebody I know by bringing it home to them,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Unlike Heckle, Fraser-Plant does not automatically qualify for coverage. He and his family are prepared to pay out of pocket, even considering travel abroad. “It’s also a possibility that we might go out of the country to get the vaccine, if that becomes necessary,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;But cost is only part of the concern. As he prepares to enter community college after a year of service with the Washington Conservation Corps, he worries about being surrounded by classmates who are now less likely to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“With community college, I mean, it’s a total crapshoot,” he said. “I don’t think most people are going to take it well, if you just walk up and ask them about their vaccination status or how seriously they take Covid.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;His unease is understandable: his grandmother recently survived cancer, leaving her immune system fragile. He takes every precaution he can – masking, boosters, vigilance – but fears that there’s only so much he can do with an increasingly unvaccinated public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“With the way vaccination rates are going, it’s just terrifying,” he said. “I just don’t know why more people don’t take these kinds of things seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Haley, a 40-year-old hairstylist from Portland, Oregon, is anxious about her job as someone who interacts with several people each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I am a person in a public job that would prefer to be vaccinated to protect myself and others, and I don’t know if I’ll qualify now,” she said, adding that she feels that the current administration’s views on vaccines are “very, very dangerous”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Roger, an emergency room physician from Alaska, said that healthcare decisions “should be based on scientific evidence, and not based on pseudoscientific ideology”. He says that he still witnesses many people die or become permanently disabled from Covid, and he’s afraid that those numbers are about to soar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I fear that as an emergency physician, I will see more unfortunate children and adults becoming ill and dying due to the lies propagated by this administration,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Elena, who is retired and living in Los Angeles, currently has stage 4 cancer and is on chemotherapy. Though she still qualifies for the vaccine, her 59-year-old husband apparently will not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Would my vaccination protect me if the person I live with gets sick? Possibly not,” she said. “And my chemo is incompatible with the only available treatment for Covid. It seems obvious that household members of immune-suppressed patients should also be eligible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Tammy Hansen, a 61-year-old librarian from Illinois, shares similar concerns of infecting a vulnerable loved one with the virus. She is about to become the caretaker for her 85-year-old mother following a major cancer surgery and ongoing chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“I want the vaccine so I can double protect her from getting Covid,” Hansen said. “My husband is 79 and I also worry about transmitting Covid to him.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;She added: “I swear if I get Covid and give it to my mom and she dies, I’ll be taking some kind of action. These fuckers are nuts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxOZFlHaVBFdG9KVzRzVkdPcHNsbWFvWC1BckozSnZkMzFnajg4ZV9BWnhib25EdmE0YXkweENxNVRfT0Frel85Slc3b3dWdDJRVGM0Zm4wR3JiRTNHZUp1LWZ0WTV2U1hURjdVbHZZRnlNVXN2Mzc5LTVmVk9EZ0RyM2U1ZkR3Nk0</guid></item><item><title>“打涂鸦”过程：如何接种流感和新冠疫苗- SFGATE</title><link>https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/covid-19-flu-vaccine-explainer-21033342.php</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Still, it has sidelined many who came down with COVID-19 and has some health officials concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are five things to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="1-we-are-not-out-of-the-woods-yet" class="subhead"&gt;1) We are not out of the woods yet.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to data released Friday, there are now 14 states with “very high” levels of coronavirus detected in their wastewater — California, Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Indiana, South Carolina, Alabama, Louisiana, Connecticut, Utah, Nevada, Idaho, Hawaii and Alaska, as well as the District of Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate at which COVID-19 lab tests are confirming infection also continues to rise statewide and in the Los Angeles area. For the week that ended Aug. 30, California’s COVID test positivity rate was 12.83%, up from 7.05% for the week that ended Aug. 2. In L.A. County, the positive test rate was 14.83%, up from 9.33%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coronavirus levels in the sewage of Northern California’s most populous county, Santa Clara, were still considered “high” as of Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="2-but-there-may-be-signs-were-reaching-the-peak" class="subhead"&gt;2) But there may be signs we’re reaching the peak.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Orange County, the COVID-19 positive test rate was 13.1%. That’s below the prior week’s rate of 18% but still higher than the rate for the week that ended Aug. 2, which was 10.8%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In San Francisco, the test positivity rate was 8.1% for the week that ended Aug. 30. That’s down from the prior week’s figure of 8.7% but higher than the 5.8% reported for the week that ended Aug. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, wastewater data in L.A. County show that coronavirus levels declined slightly from the prior week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="3-overall-the-summer-spike-has-been-generally-mild" class="subhead"&gt;3) Overall, the summer spike has been generally mild.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite a new variant, there hasn’t been much severe disease from COVID-19 this summer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID hospital admissions in California have been increasing — with the latest rate of 3.93 admissions per 100,000 residents for the week ending Aug. 30, up from 2.38, from the week ending Aug. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But they remain relatively low statewide and in L.A. County. The number of L.A. County residents seeking care for COVID-related illness, or who have been hospitalized, “is quite a bit lower than during summer surges in 2023 and 2024,” the county’s Department of Public Health said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, this summer hasn’t seen COVID activity to the extent of a year ago, when the state experienced its worst summer wave since 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="4-but-the-fall-and-winter-are-an-open-question" class="subhead"&gt;4) But the fall and winter are an open question.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mild summer wave could create conditions for problems later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-07-28/covid-rising-in-california-how-bad-will-this-summer-be"&gt;July&lt;/a&gt;, the state Department of Public Health said that scientists anticipated California would see either a stronger summer COVID wave or a more significant winter wave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="5-there-is-still-massive-confusion-over-the-future-of-covid-vaccines" class="subhead"&gt;5) There is still massive confusion over the future of COVID vaccines.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the leadership of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — a vaccine skeptic — federal agencies have in effect made it more difficult to get vaccinated against COVID-19 this year. The Food and Drug Administration has “approved” COVID-19 vaccines only for those 65 and older, as well as younger people with underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means, across the country, people younger than 65 interested in getting the COVID-19 vaccine must now either consult with a healthcare provider or “attest” to a pharmacy that they have an underlying &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/hcp/clinical-care/underlying-conditions.html" target="_blank"&gt;health condition&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a potential hurdle that can make getting the vaccine more difficult and, some health experts worry, prompt even more Americans to eschew getting vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Hawaii joined California, Washington and Oregon in launching the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/09/04/hawaii-to-join-west-coast-health-alliance-with-california-oregon-and-washington/" target="_blank"&gt;West Coast Health Alliance&lt;/a&gt;: an interstate compact meant to provide science-based immunization guidance as an alternative to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear, however, whether the formation of the West Coast Health Alliance would make it easier for people to get COVID-19 vaccines at the nation’s largest pharmacy retailers, where many people get their shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mainstream medical groups, such as the &lt;a class="link" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-073924/203222/Recommendations-for-COVID-19-Vaccines-in-Infants" target="_blank"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/08/acog-releases-updated-maternal-immunization-guidance-covid-influenza-rsv" target="_blank"&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt;, are offering their own recommendations to advise individuals and families on what vaccines they should get.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQMjVJaTVDek9JUDVXN2Y5LXY5dzFhQXFoemN1OUFrT0RydW91OE4zVDhEcnJrNVJXQkx2LXhldVpDY0hvemYzX18zWGdXLUw3LWxfd2pveFpOTldSZzMtRWNFS0lPRUZ0dHBGZUpMU21YcTVHYjY1X2NZNzVpd2VjZnRXZnVITGpxQlFfZWtZQ09aakVqREtNY2RXbUFfcmV3dFVyb2lINVllYjd2NW5SM0dtb2VFbWdr</guid></item><item><title>“真正的逆转” ：科学家发现导致大脑衰老的蛋白质，并学习如何阻止它- IFLScience</title><link>https://www.iflscience.com/truly-a-reversal-scientists-find-protein-that-causes-brain-aging-and-learn-how-to-stop-it-80715</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="isPasted"&gt;A protein that’s central to brain aging has been discovered by scientists, who’ve gone the extra mile by also finding out how it can be stopped. FTL1, as it’s called, is a key mediator of aging in the hippocampus – a part of the brain that’s particularly badly affected as the years roll by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much as people have tried – and boy, &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/that-millionaire-who-is-trying-to-de-age-himself-is-now-starting-penis-rejuvenation-therapy-70538" target="_blank"&gt;have they tried&lt;/a&gt; – there is as yet no way to &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/putin-and-xi-want-to-achieve-immortality-with-organ-transplants-could-they-80670" target="_blank"&gt;halt&lt;/a&gt; the inexorable march of time and its effects on the human body. In order to tackle aging, scientists first have to understand exactly how it works – what proteins and genes are involved, and how they impact different organs and systems in the body. This new study helps answer some of those long-standing questions as they apply to the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/artificial-sweeteners-like-aspartame-linked-to-16-years-of-extra-brain-aging-in-8-year-study-80669" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a hopeful time to be working on the biology of aging,” said senior author Saul Villeda, PhD, associate director of the Bakar Aging Research Institute at the University of California, San Francisco, in a &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/08/430551/protein-slows-aging-brain-and-we-know-how-counter-it" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team’s study compared old and young male mice. In mouse terms, “old” means 18-22 months of age, and “young”, 2-3 months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focusing in on the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/neurogenesis-confirmed-adult-brains-really-do-make-new-hippocampal-neurons-79875" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;hippocampus&lt;/a&gt; – the seahorse-shaped (if you squint) structure at the heart of the brain’s limbic system with vital roles in learning and memory – the team looked for any proteins that differed between the old and young mice. Helpfully, there was just one: FTL1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ferritin light chain 1, to give it its full name, is involved in the long-term storage of iron, a vital nutrient. The team saw that its levels were increased in the aged brains, which they suggest in their paper is “likely reflective of changes in brain iron metabolism during aging.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further analysis suggested that extra FTL1 could also negatively affect the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/tags/mitochondria" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;mitochondria&lt;/a&gt;, each cell’s own mini power station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Collectively, this body of work posits changes in mitochondria dynamics, and structural alterations to the inner membrane, as potential downstream mechanisms regulating the pro-aging effects of increased neuronal FTL1,” the authors write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their observations, they artificially increased levels of FTL1 in the brains of the young mice. Sure enough, their brains &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/this-is-the-age-when-your-brain-starts-aging-faster-and-it-starts-a-critical-window-78620" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;began to appear older&lt;/a&gt;, and they exhibited behavioral signs consistent with advancing age on tests such as navigating a maze and recognizing objects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They did the same with mouse neuronal cells grown in Petri dishes. Those that had been engineered to produce lots of FTL1 had many fewer branches, or neurites, coming off them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excitingly, the opposite was also true. When the FTL1 was artificially decreased in the brains of the older mice, their nerves began making lots of connections again, and they performed better on the cognitive tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is truly a reversal of impairments,” said Villeda. “It’s much more than merely delaying or preventing symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armed with this knowledge, the team hopes to set the stage for new, targeted &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/anti-aging-breakthrough-as-scientists-reverse-aging-with-simple-drug-cocktail-69812" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;anti-aging drugs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing more opportunities to alleviate the worst consequences of old age,” said Villeda. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as helping stave off the &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/more-evidence-that-a-daily-multivitamin-could-help-slow-cognitive-decline-in-old-age-72597" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;cognitive impacts&lt;/a&gt; of aging, they believe there could be more far-reaching consequences. Rare mutations in the &lt;em&gt;Ftl1 &lt;/em&gt;gene in humans cause a disease called &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/neuroferritinopathy" target="_blank"&gt;neuroferritinopathy&lt;/a&gt;, where iron buildup in the brain causes progressive difficulties with movement, swallowing, and speaking. There’s also some evidence that iron metabolism is altered in &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/tags/alzheimer-s-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team concludes, “[O]ur data raise the exciting possibility that the beneficial effects of targeting neuronal FTL1 at old age may extend more broadly, beyond cognitive aging, to neurodegenerative disease conditions in older people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00940-z" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 09:58:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxNd09uaE4xU1FGTVF0OTlMTTV0RFJ5T25hMFA0THl2aExuWkhhUnRQOUphY0hSLXBJalI1aDFwenUyTXBHSUtUYUIyRHdDYjdiQ19vbkdCZW5sRlpIbDZhY25UWG9fUUVRNTZTVXQxbU5IMEhVSmFBTUpTRDBfcnZrNktZY3JXUVlsRHRZNm9jNzhtM2VfSW1aaHg5aUNyQlFwU2RuZGo4ZmR2cmQwVF9GWHlabHEzdXRCc3lmMFN2NA</guid></item><item><title>希腊酸奶有多健康？ -《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/08/well/eat/greek-yogurt-health-benefits-recipes.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 09:00:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxOd29zcHlGendVQS1uZEpScEgzaWpJSmlfdWNhaWt2WkFhQ1o4QzZKMUEtWXMtQUttQlpUeG9vZk04U1ZMOVFQdUVoWW04ZzI3TmJBUy1VSzJyZnFweVF6UXVJdjdWSVdQZnc4VGNkS1YxVTJ3eEhHMFY4NXljTDd0dTJySi1JNmh2YnlBZUxR</guid></item><item><title>什么样的乳制品对身体有益？科学正在更新答案：疫苗-健康新闻- NPR</title><link>https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/09/08/nx-s1-5528747/what-kind-of-dairy-does-a-body-good-science-is-updating-the-answer</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;When new dietary guidelines are unveiled &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/31/nx-s1-5519288/the-federal-government-will-issue-new-dietary-guidelines-heres-what-to-expect" target="_blank"&gt;later this month&lt;/a&gt;, the Trump administration is expected to upend long-held advice on whole milk and its full-fat friends in the dairy aisle.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For decades, the American public has been advised to opt for fat-free or low-fat dairy options, largely out of concern for limiting the intake of saturated fat in these foods.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While the public doesn't necessarily follow this advice — cheese is the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0271531724000423?via%3Dihub#sec0007" target="_blank"&gt;leading source&lt;/a&gt; of saturated fat in our diet — Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-rfk-jr-makes-major-announcement-with-fda-and-international-dairy-foods-association" target="_blank"&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; to end the "attack on whole milk, cheese and yogurt" and give these foods new prominence in the forthcoming guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So, what's the case for ditching skim milk and other low-fat alternatives?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ehe.osu.edu/human-sciences/directory?id=bruno.27" target="_blank"&gt;Richard Bruno&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of human nutrition at the Ohio State University, says the field of nutrition has wrestled over this question for many years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's been a lot of controversy," says Bruno, who has &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38669850/" target="_blank"&gt;authored&lt;/a&gt; numerous studies on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Views have evolved in recent years as researchers have started to learn "the saturated fat from dairy foods doesn't seem to be behaving the way we think it should behave, based on the historical evidence that saturated fat is linked to heart disease," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because dairy is such a broad category — and fat content varies widely between foods like milk, yogurt and cheese — it's challenging to make sweeping statements. Yet, Bruno and others in the field say once you dig into the data, the rationale for an across-the-board recommendation to favor skim milk and low-fat dairy quickly falls away.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If we are saying that low fat is better than high fat, we should have studies demonstrating that, black and white, because guidelines should be evidence-based," says &lt;a href="https://iid.ulaval.ca/en/members/benoit-lamarche/" target="_blank"&gt;Benoît Lamarche&lt;/a&gt;, who directs the Nutrition, Health and Society Center in Quebec and is a professor at Université Laval.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;That's why Lamarche &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916525001376?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;pulled together&lt;/a&gt; leaders in the field of nutrition last year, including several who had worked on dietary guidelines, to pour over the evidence on dairy fat and its link to cardiometabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Their conclusion?&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The evidence is showing that they have the same effect and the evidence is of low quality and there's just a few studies that have looked at that," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lamarche says the argument against full-fat dairy is largely "circumstantial."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Earlier research showed people who were at a higher risk of heart disease tended to have a dietary pattern that included more full-fat dairy, but there were other factors — and foods in their diet— that could explain this finding.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We don't have the strict and rigorous evidence opposing the two types of dairy and their effect on health," he says. "We need to stop distracting people with this recommendation."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some recent studies have even signaled that consuming higher-fat dairy is not only neutral, but, in some cases, &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; also carry benefits beyond low-fat options, at least when part of a healthy eating pattern.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523121368?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;small trial&lt;/a&gt; found that participants who followed the "&lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/education/dash-eating-plan" target="_blank"&gt;DASH&lt;/a&gt;" diet — developed by scientists at the National Institutes of Health to lower hypertension — and substituted high-fat dairy had comparable improvements in blood pressure as those who ate low-fat dairy and better blood lipid levels, which is a risk factor for heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another study that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41430-017-0042-5" target="_blank"&gt;followed 18 adults&lt;/a&gt; in Europe for three weeks found drinking whole milk actually outperformed skim milk when it comes to raising HDL, or "good" cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Bruno says the hypothesis is that certain bioactive components in the milk fat membrane like phospholipids "alleviate any putative risks that would be associated with that higher intake of saturated fat."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The key, he says, seems to be how the dairy fat is delivered.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22030228/" target="_blank"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; butter — also derived from dairy but primarily composed of fat and water — has the predicted negative consequences on cholesterol; however, that's not true when people consume the same amount of saturated fat in the form of cheese, which comes with calcium, protein, minerals and other components.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In fact, Lamarche notes there's &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11704150/" target="_blank"&gt;strong evidence&lt;/a&gt; from observational studies that cheese is associated with a lower risk of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Is this real or confounded by something else?" he says. "We don't know, but the data is quite consistent on this."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Likewise, there's a well-documented link between yogurt and the prevention of Type 2 diabetes, which led the Food and Drug Administration to &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/hfp-constituent-updates/fda-announces-qualified-health-claim-yogurt-and-reduced-risk-type-2-diabetes" target="_blank"&gt;issue a health claim&lt;/a&gt; on those products (though, of course, the universe of yogurt encompasses everything from whole milk Greek yogurt to sugar-loaded nonfat varieties).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0271531724000423?via%3Dihub#sec0011" target="_blank"&gt;some recent trials&lt;/a&gt; examining higher-fat dairy products show promise, Bruno believes it's "premature to have a one-size-fits-all recommendation that consumers should favor full fat versus nonfat."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even when it comes to milk, the evidence is slim in either direction, and Lamarche argues that guidance in the U.S. and Canada should be agnostic on the question for now, until there's better data.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In its reports, the scientific advisory committee that provides guidance for the federal government on the 2025 dietary guidelines &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/Part%2520A_ExecutiveSummary_FINAL_508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;decided not to change the existing recommendations&lt;/a&gt; in support of low-fat milk because it "could not draw a conclusion about the relationship between consumption of milk with different fat content" — advice that Kennedy may very well ignore given his public comments disparaging the scientific report.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/frank-b-hu/" target="_blank"&gt;Frank Hu&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the department of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, agrees there still aren't clear answers, meaning there's no reason to start promoting full-fat dairy as superior, especially since a glass of whole milk and cheese comes with more overall calories and saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In his mind though, the much bigger problem is that Americans are mostly consuming dairy products in the form of pizza, burgers, sandwiches and other foods that are "loaded with sodium, refined starch and processed meats."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In that context, it probably doesn't make much difference if the cheese you are eating is low fat or high fat. On the other hand, it's relatively easy to "incorporate a moderate amount of dairy into your overall diet whether it's full fat or low fat," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you're replacing your carbohydrates, especially refined carbohydrates and sugar, with dairy products, even some full-fat dairy products, that's probably a good thing."&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NPR</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1AFBVV95cUxPSFhDcTNRS2FSZ0xyTDk2NnlEeGF2TVFuc3lBM181T1k5R2o1LTVYbFZ6ekdxQjdMSUY2UTU1TEVMLXgyYXFWbW5IUE1hcWJuN3BmU1VhSTgzSzZqUXZCZHN1ZnRvNHBVQUFRdjB6UU84bTdDQS1uRVNTQnhCYXVIcDhhY0hLQ0hZTXEwa1dqTlVEOFIwVzMtR0ZSNUQzOTFCVVo4LWpGcGI3UVZ4UzhvRE92bkw5MmxaVEQ5QU9DdjRFNkp6QWJrdUxwZkIxUFZDcUdGZw</guid></item><item><title>斯坦福大脑突破后小鼠自闭症症状消失- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/09/250907172644.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;Stanford Medicine scientists investigating the neurological underpinnings of autism spectrum disorder have found that hyperactivity in a specific brain region could drive behaviors commonly associated with the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a mouse model of the disease, the researchers identified the reticular thalamic nucleus -- which serves as a gatekeeper of sensory information between the thalamus and cortex -- as a potential target for treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, they were able to reverse symptoms similar to those of autism -- including susceptibility to seizures, heightened sensitivity to stimulus, increased motor activity, repetitive behaviors and decreased social interactions -- by giving the mice drugs that suppressed this area of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same drugs are being studied for the treatment of epilepsy, highlighting where the processes underlying autism spectrum disorders and epilepsy may overlap in the brain and why they often occur in the same patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings will be published Aug. 20 in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;. The senior author of the study is John Huguenard, PhD, professor of neurology and neurological sciences. The lead author is Sung-Soo Jang, PhD, a postdoctoral scholar in neurology and neurological sciences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neural circuitry connecting the thalamus and cortex has been implicated in autism in both humans and animal models, but the role of the reticular thalamic nucleus was not clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the researchers recorded the neural activity of this brain region in mice while observing the animals' behavior. In mice that had been genetically modified to model autism (Cntnap2 knockout mice), the reticular thalamic nucleus showed elevated activity when the animals encountered stimuli like light or an air puff as well as during social interactions. The brain region also showed bursts of spontaneous activity, causing seizures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is much more prevalent in people with autism than in the general population -- 30% versus 1% -- though the mechanisms are not well understood. Recognizing this connection, the researchers tested an experimental seizure drug, Z944, and found that it reversed behavioral deficits in the autism mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a different experimental treatment that genetically modifies neurons to respond to designer drugs, known as DREADD-based neuromodulation, the researchers could suppress overactivity in the reticular thalamic nucleus and reverse behavioral deficits in the autism mouse model. They could even induce these behavioral deficits in normal mice by ramping up activity in the reticular thalamic nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new findings highlight the reticular thalamic nucleus as a novel target for the treatment of autism spectrum disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The connection between sleep posture and brain health centres around a system that most people have never heard of: the glymphatic system. This network of vessels acts like a nighttime cleaning crew for your brain, flushing out toxic proteins that accumulate during waking hours.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Lev Fomchenkov, CEO of &lt;a href="https://cosmicnootropic.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cosmic Nootropic&lt;/a&gt;, said: “During sleep, the space between your brain cells expands by about 60%, allowing cerebrospinal fluid to flow more freely and wash away metabolic waste. This includes proteins like beta-amyloid and tau, which are linked to Alzheimer’s disease when they build up over time.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The position you choose for sleep appears to influence how effectively this cleaning process works significantly, potentially affecting your long-term cognitive health and memory preservation. The glymphatic system operates most efficiently when cerebrospinal fluid can flow freely through the brain's channels. Side-sleeping (specifically lying on your left or right side) appears to allow for better fluid movement compared to back or stomach sleeping.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When you sleep on your side, gravity actually helps the cerebrospinal fluid circulate more effectively through your brain tissue,” said Fomchenkov. “This improved flow means better clearance of those harmful proteins that can accumulate and contribute to cognitive decline.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The difference seems significant. Side-sleepers may clear beta-amyloid proteins more efficiently than those who sleep on their backs or stomachs. Back-sleeping can compress certain brain regions, while stomach-sleeping often restricts proper spinal alignment, both of which can impede the glymphatic system's function.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;The Connection Between Toxin Build-Up and Memory Loss&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;When your brain can't effectively clear these waste proteins during sleep, they begin to accumulate in areas responsible for memory formation and retention. Beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles, the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease, don't appear overnight. They build up gradually over years or even decades.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Think of it like not taking out your trash for weeks,” says Fomchenkov. “Eventually, the accumulation becomes problematic. In the brain, this toxic buildup interferes with neural communication and can lead to the memory problems we associate with ageing and dementia.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Poor sleep quality or ineffective toxin clearance not only affects older adults, as even younger people who consistently experience disrupted glymphatic function may be setting themselves up for cognitive issues later in life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Four Ways to Optimise Your Sleep Position for Brain Health&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Train Yourself to Side-Sleep Gradually&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you're a habitual back or stomach sleeper, don't expect to change overnight. Start by placing a pillow behind your back when lying on your side to prevent rolling. After a week or two, your body will begin to adapt to the new position naturally.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Use Proper Pillow Support&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Side-sleeping requires the right pillow height to maintain spinal alignment. Your pillow should fill the space between your shoulder and neck without tilting your head too far up or down. A pillow that's too high or too low can strain your neck and disrupt sleep quality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Add a Knee Pillow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Placing a small pillow between your knees while side-sleeping helps maintain proper hip and spine alignment. This simple adjustment can prevent the lower back strain that often causes people to abandon side-sleeping attempts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Choose the Right Mattress Firmness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Side-sleepers need a mattress that contours to their body while providing adequate support. A mattress that's too firm can create pressure points at the hips and shoulders, while one that's too soft won't provide enough spinal support.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The goal is to wake up feeling rested, not stiff or sore,” notes Fomchenkov. “If your sleep position is causing discomfort, your brain won't get the deep, restorative sleep it needs for optimal detoxification.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fomchenkov said: “Most people think about sleep in terms of duration, i.e., getting those recommended eight hours. However, position may also play an important role in brain health. Your sleep posture can influence how effectively your brain performs its nightly maintenance routine. When the glymphatic system can't function properly, you're essentially allowing toxic proteins to accumulate that could affect your memory and cognitive function years down the line.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What's particularly concerning is that many people dismiss minor sleep discomforts or assume that waking up with a stiff neck is just part of ageing. In reality, these could be signs that your sleep position isn't supporting optimal brain detoxification. Making simple adjustments to how you sleep tonight could be one of the most important investments you make in your long-term cognitive health. The brain's ability to clear waste during sleep is something we should all be paying attention to, especially as we learn more about its connection to neurodegenerative diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Mon, 08 Sep 2025 07:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxNOEpNLXNOWk05MXFOTDZNX1lPbUJVaGJnRUJ2ZzFRRXBRbzBHZmZIcVk5VEt0YzRxTlNqY3doWVNQLWJVS1dES08zOU9GQUdOdjlRZ2w5SE9QMVJyS3RsUzJQNDZLUzFRNk1rc1ktTDUtc3RHa1NST0JybTNYQWoxd1dLZmRrSWtsdnhFbNIBkgFBVV95cUxNM0pCbWtkQ3IzZ0tQT3VRMVhwRHBVMUxLQ09BbDFmRGNnTlRMQlZOTFRPeG0yWDFUZDZCT2xxaGJ3bWN1T1hmaEQwOXBqOXlfVVY0bWJUWENEZW1pckdjSmNVTzRkdmFMNFVla3FtZjMxcFhrdFdUU1YtSHJHdjhWeVh0X1NqS3V2dFZCeDEwbzBMQQ</guid></item><item><title>行人被SF Muni有轨电车撞伤- SFGATE</title><link>https://www.sfgate.com/news/bayarea/article/sf-pedestrian-struck-injured-by-muni-streetcar-21036045.php</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person was involved in a collision with a downtown streetcar in San Francisco on Sunday afternoon, according to the Fire Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;First responders arrived at 1129 Market St. just after 4:30 p.m. on a report of a Muni streetcar versus a pedestrian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Fire Department, when they arrived the person had "self extricated" and no heavy rescue was required.

			&lt;p&gt;Why do health stories about food and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="173374" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; grab so much attention? Because they offer an enticing promise: that a single item on your plate, or even a sudden change in what you crave, might hold the key to spotting disease early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/five-ways-to-cut-your-risk-of-cancer-by-an-oncology-consultant-245858"&gt;compelling idea&lt;/a&gt;, but in reality, the science of appetite, taste, and cancer is far messier than the &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15053851/Doctor-craving-food-three-months-cancer-diagnosis.html"&gt;headlines suggest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This eye-catching idea oversimplifies reality. While cancer can change appetite and taste, there's no solid evidence that a sudden craving, such as an abrupt fixation on sweets, serves as a dependable early warning signal for undiagnosed cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/an-early-warning-signal-of-a-silent-killer-cancer-may-hide-in-your-poop"&gt;An Early Warning Signal of a 'Silent Killer' Cancer May Hide in Your Poop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a classic case where interesting clinical &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2528597/"&gt;anecdotes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11345347/"&gt;stories&lt;/a&gt; have been &lt;a href="https://www.clinicalradiologyonline.net/article/S0009-9260(82)80323-1/fulltext"&gt;stretched&lt;/a&gt; into a sweeping rule that doesn't work as a screening tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The grain of truth behind these headlines comes from clinical observations. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some cancer patients do report &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9407804/"&gt;altered taste and appetite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. In &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.clinicalradiologyonline.net/article/S0009-9260(82)80323-1/fulltext"&gt;older case studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, patients described dramatic changes – tea suddenly tasting awful, or favourite foods becoming repulsive – sometimes before diagnosis, sometimes after treatment began.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173389" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173389" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/avoiding_food_642.jpg" alt="man rejecting coffee" class="wp-image-173389 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/avoiding_food_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/avoiding_food_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/avoiding_food_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173389" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Cancer can cause favourite foods to become repulsive, though it's not a reliable sign of disease. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEef1ZbV2I/"&gt;AndreyPopov/Getty Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These accounts seem compelling, but they were never designed to prove that a particular craving reliably predicts cancer. They show that cancer can affect how we taste and eat, not that a single symptom can replace proper diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern research paints a more complex picture. Studies examining "altered food behaviour" around cancer cover a wide range of changes: cravings, aversions, emotional eating, and treatment-related appetite shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36183484/"&gt;These studies&lt;/a&gt; look at different cancers, stages, and time points – before, during, and after treatment. The overall message is that eating behaviour can change in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12067045/"&gt;context of cancer&lt;/a&gt;, influenced by biology (inflammation and metabolism), physiology (changes to taste and smell), and psychology (stress and mood).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we don't see is a specific craving pattern that reliably warns of cancer in healthy people. Appetite changes can be part of the cancer story, but they're &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16512959/"&gt;not a diagnostic shortcut&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's worth bearing in mind how common appetite changes are in everyday life. Many ordinary factors affect what tastes good and what the body wants, including medications, pregnancy, stress, quitting smoking, and anaemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sudden enthusiasm for a particular food might be &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34684583/"&gt;interesting&lt;/a&gt;, but it rarely points to a single cause. That's why doctors look for clusters of symptoms and lasting patterns rather than drawing &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40640799/"&gt;conclusions&lt;/a&gt; from one change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Chewing ice&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is one area where cravings connect meaningfully to health: ice chewing. Constantly chewing ice (called pagophagia) can signal iron deficiency, which has treatable causes that should be found and addressed. This is completely different from claims that tumours program sugar cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_173388" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173388" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/eating_icecube_642.jpg" alt="woman eating ice cube" class="wp-image-173388 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/eating_icecube_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/eating_icecube_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/eating_icecube_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-173388" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Feeling a constant need to chew ice could be a sign of iron deficiency. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAGfWuDP4Jc/"&gt;Aflo Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ice chewing represents a well-established link between unusual eating behaviour and a specific, testable condition. Iron deficiency itself is both &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31474155/"&gt;common and often missed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iron is essential for making haemoglobin, which carries oxygen in red blood cells, and plays broader roles in energy and immune function. When levels drop, symptoms are often vague: persistent fatigue despite adequate sleep, exercise intolerance, shortness of breath, and headaches, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These overlap with many other conditions, which is why testing matters rather than guessing. Iron comes from red meat, poultry, seafood, beans, lentils, leafy greens, and fortified cereals and breads. However, a "good" &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/causes-of-cancer/diet-and-cancer"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt; doesn't always guarantee adequate iron if losses are high, needs are elevated, or absorption is poor – another reason to &lt;a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/prevention-wellness/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-iron-deficiency"&gt;confirm and treat the problem&lt;/a&gt; with proper testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;No magic clues&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Returning to the headlines, it's easy to see why supposed tell-tale cravings capture attention. They promise a simple signal in a confusing health landscape. But medicine rarely offers magic clues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sensible &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22828477/"&gt;approach&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24309062/"&gt;twofold&lt;/a&gt;. First, treat new, persistent, and unexplained changes in taste or appetite as worth noting – not panicking about. Consider the full picture: other symptoms, recent illnesses, medications, stress, and overall health. If behaviour like ice chewing appears or fatigue becomes stubborn, checking for iron deficiency makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, for &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/16/10299"&gt;cancer risk&lt;/a&gt; concerns, rely on established warning signs and screening tests. Unexplained weight loss, unusual bleeding, changes in bowel habits, swallowing difficulties, new or changing lumps, and age-appropriate screening catch far more cancers than chasing a single craving ever will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The craving narrative carries another danger: it can fuel harmful behaviour, like trying to &lt;a href="https://www.foyles.co.uk/book/how-to-starve-cancer/jane-mclelland/9780951951736"&gt;"starve"&lt;/a&gt; a tumour by cutting out major nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severe restriction can cause dangerous weight loss, malnutrition, and, worse, treatment tolerance, undermining recovery rather than helping. Tumours don't outsmart sensible nutrition. What helps most is maintaining strength with a balanced diet, staying active when possible, following evidence-based screening and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/unlocking-the-bodys-defences-understanding-immunotherapy-226858"&gt;treatment&lt;/a&gt;, and using targeted tests – like iron studies – when symptoms suggest they might be &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10286856/"&gt;helpful&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Appetite and taste are sensitive measures of health and their changes deserve attention. They're part of the medical conversation, not a crystal ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If something feels wrong and stays wrong – whether that's a new aversion to familiar foods, an odd fixation that won't go away, or constant ice chewing – the next step isn't to search Google for hidden meanings. Instead, talk with a doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple tests can quickly rule out common problems, and if something more serious is happening, acting on established warning signs and screening guidelines offers the best chance of catching it early.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264378/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

When your vitamin D levels are low, it can affect multiple systems in your body, often in subtle ways that are easy to overlook. Deficiency can result from limited sun exposure, poor dietary intake, or medical conditions that impair absorption. Symptoms may include fatigue, frequent illness, muscle weakness, or even mood changes. Recognising these early signs and addressing the deficiency through diet, supplements, or sunlight can help prevent long-term health complications and improve overall well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happens when your vitamin D is low: 10 signs to watch&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Fatigue and tiredness&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the earliest signs of low vitamin D is persistent fatigue. Vitamin D helps your body maintain energy by supporting muscle function and overall cellular activity. When levels are insufficient, cells may not function optimally, leading to feelings of tiredness even after adequate sleep. Correcting the deficiency through supplements or sunlight exposure can often help restore energy levels. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8912284/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;published in the Journal Nutrients found that individuals with low vitamin D levels reported higher levels of fatigue and poorer sleep quality. Supplementation with vitamin D improved energy levels and sleep patterns in these individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Frequent illness&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is essential for a strong immune system. Low levels can weaken your body’s ability to fight infections, making you more prone to colds, flu, or respiratory illnesses. Sunlight exposure, dietary sources like fatty fish, and supplements are common ways to maintain healthy levels. Regular testing and personalized supplementation are important, especially for people living in areas with limited sunlight or those with underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Studies have linked vitamin D deficiency to higher disease severity in intensive care patients and increased susceptibility to viral infections like COVID-19. Ensuring adequate vitamin D helps your immune cells respond effectively to pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Muscle weakness and pain&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D plays a vital role in muscle strength and coordination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532266/?" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;published in StatPearls notes that insufficient vitamin D levels may lead to muscle weakness, increasing the risk of falls, especially in older adults. Without enough of it, muscles may feel weak or sore, and you could experience cramps or difficulty performing everyday activities. This is because vitamin D regulates calcium and phosphorus in muscle tissues, which are essential for contraction and repair. Low levels also increase the risk of falls, particularly in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Back pain&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic back pain can be linked to low vitamin D levels. Vitamin D deficiency can weaken bones and muscles, placing extra strain on the spine. Low bone density increases the risk of spinal stress and micro-fractures, especially in the lower back. Supplementing vitamin D in deficient individuals has been shown to help reduce pain in some cases, particularly when combined with calcium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Bone fractures and osteoporosis&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is necessary for calcium absorption and maintaining bone density. Deficiency can lead to soft bones (osteomalacia) and contribute to osteoporosis, which increases fracture risk. Adults with low vitamin D may experience unexpected fractures even from minor falls or bumps. Maintaining adequate levels strengthens bones and reduces the likelihood of injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hair loss&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D influences hair follicle health and the hair growth cycle. Low vitamin D can slow hair regeneration, leading to thinning or hair loss. Conditions like alopecia areata, an autoimmune disorder, are associated with low vitamin D levels, and treatments that include supplementation have shown improvement in hair regrowth. Adequate vitamin D ensures proper follicle function and healthy hair growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Depression and mood changes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D affects brain function and the regulation of neurotransmitters, which influence mood. Deficiency has been linked to a higher risk of depression and mood swings. Low levels can affect serotonin production, which may lead to feelings of sadness or lethargy. Restoring vitamin D levels may support emotional well-being alongside other therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Weight gain&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low vitamin D is associated with increased fat storage. Vitamin D is stored in fat cells, which can prevent it from circulating in the blood efficiently. People with obesity are more likely to have low blood levels of vitamin D. This deficiency can affect metabolism, potentially making weight management more challenging and contributing to further fat accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Eczema and skin issues&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D supports skin barrier function and immune response. A deficiency can worsen chronic skin conditions like eczema, leading to irritation, inflammation, and flare-ups. Adequate vitamin D helps regulate immune responses in the skin and improves its ability to repair and protect itself against environmental triggers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also see: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/too-little-or-too-much-of-this-common-vitamin-may-raise-cancer-risk-experts-find/articleshow/123658338.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Too little or too much of THIS common vitamin may raise cancer risk, experts find&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Slow wound healing&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D plays a role in tissue repair and immunity. Low levels can delay the healing process for cuts, scrapes, or surgical wounds. Without sufficient vitamin D, immune cells are less effective at controlling infection and supporting tissue regeneration, making recovery slower and increasing the risk of complications. Adequate vitamin D intake also supports collagen formation, reduces inflammation, promotes faster wound closure, and enhances overall skin health, ensuring the body recovers efficiently from injuries while maintaining stronger immunity against pathogens. Vitamin D helps regulate calcium balance, supports cellular communication, and works synergistically with other nutrients like vitamin K to optimise healing and bone recovery. Regular sun exposure, fortified foods, and supplements can further boost vitamin D levels, enhancing recovery, preventing deficiencies, and supporting overall musculoskeletal and immune health. low vitamin D can also worsen chronic conditions, impact mood, weaken bones, and impair the body's ability to fight off everyday infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: This article is for general informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

The rising number of people affected by this condition leads to multiple false beliefs about it which create confusion and potentially dangerous misunderstandings. Dr. Saurabh Sethi, a gastroenterologist trained at Harvard and Stanford, recently took to his IG handle to bust 3 major myths about the condition. Take a look...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth 1: Fatty liver is caused by eating fat&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People frequently believe that fatty liver disease develops because of consuming excessive fat in their diet. This is not true. Dr Sethi says that the main risk factors for developing fatty liver disease stem from consuming excessive amounts of sugary foods containing high fructose content, and unhealthy oils instead of healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical research together with expert doctors demonstrate that the liver benefits from fats, which come from sources like extra virgin olive oil, avocados and nuts. The main reason liver fat accumulation occurs, is because of consuming excessive amounts of processed sugars together with unhealthy oils instead of healthy fats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prevention of sugar-rich foods and unhealthy oils takes precedence over fat avoidance in your diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A balanced diet that includes healthy fats serves as a method to support liver operation and maintain overall wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Fatty liver diet: Best and worst foods for your liver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fatty liver is harmless&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The belief that fatty liver disease presents no risk to health and does not need medical attention is completely incorrect. This is false. According to Dr Sethi, the progression of fatty liver disease remains hidden until it causes severe damage to the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excessive liver fat accumulation above 5% of liver weight, results in inflammation and scarring that can progress to liver failure when left untreated. The progression of NAFLD through NASH to fibrosis and cirrhosis, represents three dangerous stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The absence of symptoms in people with fatty liver disease makes it difficult to detect the condition at an early stage. Research demonstrates that untreated fatty liver disease raises the chances of developing liver cancer and fatal liver disease stages. The detection of fatty liver disease at an early stage, requires immediate attention to diet and exercise for proper management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Myth 3: Supplements serve as essential treatment for fatty liver&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Sethi says that many people think supplements play a vital role in treating fatty liver disease, but this belief holds some inaccuracies. The primary treatment for fatty liver disease consists of diet and exercise, although some supplements including milk thistle, omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin E and N-acetylcysteine, show potential benefits for liver &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://liver.org.au/your-liver/liver-diseases/fatty-liver-disease/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that eating unprocessed foods and cutting back on sugary foods and unhealthy oils, leads to substantial liver health improvements. Physical exercise combined with weight reduction, helps patients eliminate liver fat accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplements function best when used as part of a complete treatment plan, but they do not function as standalone solutions for fatty liver disease. Medical supervision becomes necessary when using supplements, because they can produce adverse effects and interact with prescribed medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prevention of fatty liver disease&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People

Credit: Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research indicates that hormonal birth control can influence emotions and memory, shaping the daily reality of women worldwide.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hormonal birth control is a fact of life for millions of women. In the United States alone, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that more than 60 million women of reproductive age have used some form of contraception. While the primary reason is to prevent pregnancy, many also rely on it to help manage health conditions such as endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome, and irregular menstrual cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond its physical effects, many women say that birth control influences their emotional well-being. Shifts in mood, changes in weight, and periods of emotional turbulence are commonly shared experiences. Now, new research from &lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/tag/rice-university/"&gt;Rice University&lt;/a&gt; suggests the impact may reach further, affecting both emotions and memory in unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the study, which appears in the journal &lt;em&gt;Hormones and Behavior&lt;/em&gt;, hormonal contraceptives seem to influence how women process emotions in the moment as well as how they recall emotional experiences later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For women, the findings highlight what many have long suspected: Birth control can affect more than reproductive health,” said Beatriz Brandao, a graduate student in Rice’s Department of Psychological Sciences and lead author of the study. “Hormonal birth control does more than prevent pregnancy — it also influences brain areas involved in emotions and memory, which are central to mental health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How the Study Worked&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers compared women using hormonal contraceptives with women who were naturally cycling. Participants viewed positive, negative, and neutral images while applying different emotion regulation strategies, such as distancing, reinterpretatio,n or immersion, and later completed a memory test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women on hormonal contraceptives showed stronger emotional reactions compared to naturally cycling women. When they used strategies like distancing or reinterpretation, they remembered fewer details of negative events, though their general memory remained intact. In other words, they could recall the overall event but not all of the specifics. That gap may actually be helpful, allowing women to move on instead of replaying unpleasant details. Strategies like immersion boosted memory for positive images in both groups, making happy moments stick more clearly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings add weight to a question many women have had but few studies have answered: How does birth control affect not just the body but the mind? Emotion regulation and memory are tied to mental health outcomes such as depression, and this research suggests hormonal contraceptives may influence those processes in subtle but meaningful ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Researchers’ Perspectives&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised to find that when women on hormonal birth control used strategies like distancing or reinterpretation, they remembered fewer details of negative events,” Brandao said. “That reduced memory for unpleasant experiences may actually be protective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These results are novel and shed light on how hormonal contraceptives may influence emotion and memory processes in important ways,” said Bryan Denny, associate professor of psychological sciences at Rice and co-author of the study. “Beatriz’s work is ongoing and programmatic, allowing for continued investigation of these processes in women taking hormonal contraceptives as well as in naturally cycling women.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These findings are very exciting,” said Stephanie Leal, adjunct assistant professor of psychological sciences at Rice, assistant professor at &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;UCLA&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) is a major public research university located in Los Angeles, California, and part of the University of California system. It excels in neuroscience, climate science, engineering, and health policy. UCLA’s medical center and research facilities are among the most advanced in the U.S.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;UCLA&lt;/span&gt; and senior author of the study. “They suggest that hormonal birth control has the ability to modulate both how women can regulate their emotions as well as how that regulation may influence memory, especially toward negative experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brandao and her collaborators plan to expand the work by studying naturally cycling women across different menstrual phases and by comparing types of hormonal contraceptives, such as pills versus IUDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ultimately, our goal is to understand how reproductive hormones — whether natural or synthetic — shape emotional health so that women can make more informed choices about their reproductive and mental health,” Brandao said.&lt;/p&gt;

Dr. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/sudhir-kumar" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Sudhir Kumar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, a neurologist from Hyderabad, experienced this struggle firsthand when his weight reached 100 kilograms. However, through steady, practical lifestyle changes, he managed to shed 30 kilograms over two years — a transformation that not only changed his physical appearance but also his overall health and confidence. Dr. Kumar’s journey, shared openly on social media, offers valuable insights and inspiration for anyone hoping to make lasting changes without resorting to extreme diets or grueling exercise routines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dr. Kumar’s &lt;keyword id="4470428" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="fitness-journey" source="Orion"&gt;fitness journey&lt;/keyword&gt;: Overcoming &lt;keyword id="28749874" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="weight-struggles" source="Orion"&gt;weight struggles&lt;/keyword&gt; amid a busy schedule revealed&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before starting his fitness journey in late 2020, Dr. Kumar found himself trapped in a cycle that many people struggling with weight can relate to. His work as a neurologist demanded 16 to 17-hour days, leaving very little time for self-care. The long hours meant he often slept just 4 to 5 hours a night, which severely impacted his energy levels and metabolism. On top of this, his diet was far from ideal — frequent overeating, regular consumption of junk food, sugary snacks, and soft drinks added fuel to the fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physically, the consequences were evident. Walking even five kilometers was a major challenge for him, and he experienced difficulty with stamina and endurance. It was clear that drastic changes were needed, but they had to fit into the reality of a busy medical professional’s life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How limiting work hours enabled Dr. Kumar to focus on &lt;keyword id="865258" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="fitness-and-nutrition" source="Orion"&gt;fitness and nutrition&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most important changes Dr. Kumar made was to significantly reduce his working hours. By limiting his workday to 8-9 hours, he was able to reclaim precious time to focus on his health and well-being. This shift was crucial because it not only reduced stress but also allowed him to prioritize exercise and proper meal preparation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people underestimate the impact of work-life balance on health. Dr. Kumar’s example highlights how setting boundaries around work can directly contribute to better physical and mental wellness, making it easier to adopt and maintain healthy habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How better sleep helped Dr. Kumar regulate appetite and boost metabolism&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another cornerstone of Dr. Kumar’s transformation was improving his sleep quality. Increasing his nightly sleep to 7-8 hours was a game changer. Sleep plays a vital role in regulating the hormones that control hunger and fullness. Without adequate rest, the body tends to produce more ghrelin (which increases appetite) and less leptin (which signals fullness), making it harder to avoid overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, sleep supports metabolic health, aids muscle recovery, and boosts mental clarity — all of which are essential for maintaining an active lifestyle and making good dietary choices. By prioritizing sleep, Dr. Kumar laid a solid foundation for sustainable weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How cutting refined carbs and increasing protein aids lasting weight loss&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it came to nutrition, Dr. Kumar took a balanced and realistic approach. He stopped drinking soft drinks altogether and cut down drastically on junk food and sugary treats, which are often major contributors to unwanted weight gain. Instead of following a fad diet, he focused on reducing his carbohydrate intake — especially refined carbs — while increasing the amount of protein he consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protein is known to help keep you feeling full longer and helps preserve muscle mass during weight loss. This thoughtful adjustment in his diet allowed Dr. Kumar to shed pounds without feeling deprived or hungry, making the changes sustainable over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How consistent running helped him lose weight and improve his health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kumar didn’t rush into intense exercise. He started slow, walking five kilometers even though it was difficult at first. Over the course of several weeks, he gradually increased his distance to 10 kilometers, building endurance at a comfortable pace. Eventually, he transitioned into slow jogging and then running, focusing more on how long he stayed active rather than how fast he went.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach helped him avoid injury and burnout. Later, in December 2022, he added strength training sessions three times a week, which helped build muscle, improve metabolism, and further enhance his body composition. The combination of aerobic activity and resistance training proved to be a winning formula for his sustained weight loss. Over time, Dr. Kumar’s dedication to running became apparent through the impressive distances he covered. In 2021, he averaged 15 kilometers per day, completed 339 runs of 10 kilometers or more, ran 69 half marathons, and even completed a full marathon. The following year, while slightly reducing his daily average to 12.6 kilometers, he still managed 304 runs of 10 kilometers or more, along with 43 half marathons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The physical transformation was impressive, but Dr. Kumar experienced benefits far beyond the number on the scale. Losing 30 kilograms brought a remarkable increase in energy and stamina. He reported feeling more focused and productive in both his professional and personal life. Alongside these changes, his self-confidence soared, reflecting the powerful impact of improved health on mental well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical tests showed improvements across the board. His resting heart rate dropped from 72 to an impressively low 40-42 beats per minute, indicating better cardiovascular fitness. Key health markers such as blood sugar levels (HbA1C), cholesterol, and blood pressure all improved, lowering his risk for chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Practical tips from Dr. Kumar’s &lt;keyword id="2835833" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="weight-loss-journey" source="Orion"&gt;weight loss journey&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on his experience, Dr. Kumar stresses the importance of consistency. Showing up to exercise regularly matters more than pushing yourself to run faster or harder every day. He encourages people to focus on enjoying the activity and listening to their bodies instead of chasing personal bests or competing with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also highlights the value of cross-training — incorporating various forms of exercise to keep workouts interesting and reduce injury risk. Diet-wise, he advises mindful eating, suggesting that reducing overall calorie intake and possibly experimenting with time-restricted eating can be beneficial, though it should be tailored to individual needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, he underlines the non-negotiable role of good sleep in any fitness journey, reminding us that 7-8 hours per night is essential for optimal results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The information shared in this article is based on Dr. Sudhir Kumar’s personal health journey and is intended for informational and inspirational purposes only.

			&lt;p&gt;In recent years, an increasing number of scientific investigations have backed an alarming hypothesis:  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="173272" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease may not be merely a condition of an aging brain, &lt;a href="scientists-identify-a-virus-and-two-types-of-bacteria-that-could-be-linked-to-alzheimer-s"&gt;but the product of infection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the exact mechanisms of this infection are something researchers are &lt;a href="scientists-think-alzheimer-s-may-be-caused-by-our-brains-defence-system"&gt;still trying to isolate&lt;/a&gt;, numerous studies suggest the &lt;a href="alzheimers-disease-beta-amyloid-source-outside-brain"&gt;deadly emergence&lt;/a&gt; of Alzheimer's &lt;a href="surgical-tools-could-spreading-alzheimers-proteins"&gt;goes way beyond&lt;/a&gt; what we used to think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such study, published in 2019, suggested what could be one of the most definitive leads yet for a bacterial culprit behind Alzheimer's, and it comes from a somewhat unexpected quarter: gum disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/stomach-ulcer-bacteria-could-be-a-surprise-ally-against-alzheimers"&gt;Stomach Ulcer Bacteria Could Be a Surprise Ally Against Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of their study:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a paper led by senior author Jan Potempa, a microbiologist from the University of Louisville, researchers reported the discovery of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porphyromonas_gingivalis"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Porphyromonas gingivalis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – the pathogen behind &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_periodontitis"&gt;chronic periodontitis&lt;/a&gt; (aka gum disease) – in the brains of deceased Alzheimer's patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't the first time the &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1532-5415.2010.02788.x"&gt;two factors have been linked&lt;/a&gt;, but the researchers went further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In separate experiments with mice, oral infection with the pathogen led to brain colonization by the bacteria, together with increased production of amyloid beta (Aβ), the sticky proteins commonly associated with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, coordinated by pharma startup Cortexyme, which was co-founded by first author Stephen Dominy, wasn't claiming to have discovered definitive evidence of Alzheimer's causation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was clear they thought we had a strong line of investigation here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=" wf_caption"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="/images/2019-01/530-alzheimers-gum-disease-bacteria-1.jpg" alt="530 alzheimers gum disease bacteria 1" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis' gingipains&lt;/em&gt; (red) among neurons in the brain of a patient with Alzheimer's. (Cortexyme)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Infectious agents have been implicated in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease before, but the evidence of causation hasn't been convincing," &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324298"&gt;Dominy said at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now, for the first time, we have solid evidence connecting the intracellular, Gram-negative pathogen, &lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt;, and Alzheimer's pathogenesis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the team identified toxic enzymes called gingipains secreted by the bacteria in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, which correlated with two separate markers of the disease: the tau protein, and a protein tag called ubiquitin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even more compellingly, the team identified these toxic gingipains in the brains of deceased people who were never diagnosed with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's important, because while &lt;em&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; and the disease have been linked before, it's never been known – to put it simply – whether gum disease causes Alzheimers, or whether dementia leads to poor oral care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_152675" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152675" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/dentist_gum_disease_642.jpg" alt="dentist checking x rays" class="wp-image-152675 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/dentist_gum_disease_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/dentist_gum_disease_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/dentist_gum_disease_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-152675" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Does gum disease cause Alzheimer's, or could those with dementia be at greater risk of poor dental hygiene?
