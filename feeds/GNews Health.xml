Can it help us sleep better? Sort our digestion problems? Give our busy brains a moment of peace?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;In the fast-moving world of supplements, it's magnesium's time to shine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And the industry is booming.

"Around the UK, obviously, but also to Australia, parts of Asia, Kuwait, Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"It's one of our biggest sellers and the market just keeps growing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;He is shouting over the hum of the pill presser, a machine that resembles a Dalek, which pops out dozens of small white magnesium tablets a second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Do we actually need it?" I bellow back. "And why now, why has it become so popular?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Influencers, social media - that's what's pushing it," Mr Goring explains. "We've known about magnesium and its benefits for years and now, finally, it's mainstream."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;I can almost hear the eye roll when I contact Kirsten Jackson, a dietitian who specialises in gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Clever marketing schemes," Ms Jackson says, "magnesium is involved in areas people are willing to invest in: their sleep, digestion, mental health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But, she is keen to stress, this does not automatically mean we need supplements to improve those things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Magnesium is one of several minerals in our bodies. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/vitamins-and-minerals/others/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;The recommended daily amount&lt;/a&gt; for women is 270mg and for men, it's 300mg. We store about 25g.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It might make up less than 1% of us but "it is involved in over 300 different processes", Ms Jackson explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It is "especially important for our brain and mood," she says, because it helps nerves send messages properly and supports the building blocks of brain cell membranes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It also helps balance blood sugar levels, regulate blood pressure, and is an essential player in moving calcium and potassium in and out of our cells, which maintains the rhythm of our heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;So, surely popping a pill full of the stuff should keep our bodies running smoothly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It's more complex than that, says Ms Jackson. For a magnesium supplement to work, we need to be lacking the mineral in the first place - and it's difficult to test for any deficiency because the vast majority of our magnesium is stored in our bones and tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But on an individual level, many say the supplement has made a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/7d65/live/0cb54870-b0e2-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7d65/live/0cb54870-b0e2-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7d65/live/0cb54870-b0e2-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/7d65/live/0cb54870-b0e2-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/7d65/live/0cb54870-b0e2-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/7d65/live/0cb54870-b0e2-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/7d65/live/0cb54870-b0e2-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7d65/live/0cb54870-b0e2-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Katie Curran Katie Curran, a woman with green eyes, with blonde shoulder length hair " class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Katie Curran&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Katie says magnesium supplements have helped improve her sleep and calmed her racing thoughts&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;For Katie Curran, a communications specialist who has worked with some of the biggest fashion brands, sleeping well was something she could only dream about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"A year ago, I was struggling," she confides. "It would take so long to get to sleep, my brain was racing, and then I would get off only to wake a couple of hours later."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Katie decided to try magnesium glycinate - a combination of magnesium and glycine, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-023-00970-8" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;an amino acid with limited evidence &lt;/a&gt;linking it to better sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;After two weeks of taking 270mg a day, she says the noise in her head started to quieten. The racing thoughts slowed down, and she began to feel like she could function again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"My sleep definitely improved, I had more energy. I became more active. Other things changed in my life, so I can't put it down to just one thing, but I think the magnesium supplements were an important part of the puzzle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;While being deficient in magnesium can definitely affect sleep patterns, there isn't the evidence to say taking supplements will definitely improve your sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Social media is awash with eager supplement-takers, many with posts stamped with "commission paid" in the corner - meaning they could earn money from their story or reel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;According to these influencers, it feels as though there is little magnesium can't help with, as they recommend a variety of different products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Magnesium is often mixed with other compounds with the aim of helping support various parts of our bodies. For example, magnesium mixed with either L-threonate or glycinate is supposed to target brain health, which helps with sleep and stress relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;If magnesium is combined with chloride, it is recommended for muscle tension and pre-menstrual cramps, while citrate and oxide blends are aimed at digestion and help with constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt; The majority of us can probably relate to having at least one of those issues. But as nutritionist Kristen Stavridis stresses, the problem is there is not enough strong evidence to show the majority of these different magnesium supplements have a positive effect on the healthy population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And even if they did - we would need to be deficient in magnesium in the first place to see a benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We have supplement companies shouting out at us: 'We are all going to die'," Ms Stavridis says, "'Quick! Take my pill and - hey presto - there's your solution'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Many of us are not getting enough magnesium," she continues, "around 10% of men and 20% of women are not getting the&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6060686/" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt; recommended daily intake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"But just taking a supplement is not the answer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/f178/live/c514cad0-b0ec-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/f178/live/c514cad0-b0ec-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f178/live/c514cad0-b0ec-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/f178/live/c514cad0-b0ec-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/f178/live/c514cad0-b0ec-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/f178/live/c514cad0-b0ec-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/f178/live/c514cad0-b0ec-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f178/live/c514cad0-b0ec-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Seeds, nuts, whole grain breads, greens and fruit images" class="sc-5340b511-0 hLdNfA"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-5340b511-2 jVqbAn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 Qwxkf"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 gnQokQ"&gt;Seeds, nuts, whole-grain breads, greens and fruit are all rich in magnesium&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Take sleep health, for example.

Some trials say it can have some benefits, while some randomised controlled trials - the gold standard - are more sceptical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;There is also the added complication of supplements potentially working against each other because of the way they interact in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Taking zinc, for example - a supplement often recommended for peri-menopausal women - can also &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-HealthProfessional/#:~:text=Absorption%20of%20magnesium%20from%20different,in%20the%20body%20%5B17%5D" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;affect the absorption rate of magnesium.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Basically, Ms Stavridis says, it's a minefield, and not just a simple case of "take this" and you'll be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She recommends looking at diet first.

&lt;p&gt;The supplements were: &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud/public-notification-artri-king-contains-hidden-drug-ingredients"&gt;Artri King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud/nhan-sam-tuyet-lien-truy-phong-hoan-may-be-harmful-due-hidden-drug-ingredients"&gt;Nhan Sam Tuyet Lien&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud/public-notification-linsen-double-caulis-plus-lingxianshuangtengsu-contains-hidden-drug-ingredient"&gt;Linsen Double Caulis Plus&lt;/a&gt;. All are known to contain unlisted glucocorticoids, according to the Food and Drug Administration. And testing of two of the man’s supplements by the hospital confirmed the presence of the steroids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors determined that the man had essentially overdosed on the glucocorticoids—he had taken doses that exceeded the normal levels of glucocorticoids in the body. The steroids likely suppressed immune responses, leading to his infections and GI ulcers. But, more significantly, the excess steroid levels also caused his HPA axis to essentially shut down. While it’s possible to get the HPA axis back up and running after withdrawal from excessive steroid use, the amount of time that takes can vary. Further, if a person stops taking large doses of glucocorticoids abruptly, rather than gradually—as in the man’s case—and particularly after chronic use—also as in the man’s case—it can lead to an &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000357.htm"&gt;adrenal crisis&lt;/a&gt;. In retrospect, the man had all the signs of a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors started treating him with hydrocortisone (medication cortisol) to get him out of danger. But it took six weeks before his HPA axis showed signs of recovery on tests. By that time, he had developed recurrent bacterial infections in his blood and had persistent delirium. It was only after several months in the hospital that he was able to be discharged back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, the doctors describe the man’s case as a cautionary tale. Many Americans use supplements, but their efficacy is largely unproven, and they are not rigorously regulated for safety. And even though, in this case, the FDA had issued warnings specifically about the three supplements the man took, his case highlights that public awareness of such dangers remains low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Clinicians must remain vigilant in assessing supplement use and educate patients on potential risks, particularly regarding hidden glucocorticoids, to prevent serious health complications such as adrenal insufficiency,” the doctors conclude.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Superagers retain sharp minds into their 80s and beyond, defying the idea that cognitive decline is inevitable as we age. A 25-year study of these enviable few now reveals some of what's special about their underlying neurology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's really what we've found in their brains that's been so earth-shattering for us," &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/08/what-makes-a-superager"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Northwestern University clinical neuropsychologist Sandra Weintraub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weintraub and colleagues found superagers' brains are oddly resistant to the buildup of Alzheimer's-related protein clumps and tangles. These individuals also have a higher concentration of one specific type of neuron in a critical region of their brain, and exhibit less inflammatory activity in their &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_matter"&gt;white matter&lt;/a&gt; compared to the general aging population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the findings need to be validated in other populations, identifying a distinct neurobiological profile in superagers "opens the door to new interventions aimed at preserving brain health well into the later decades of life," &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/08/what-makes-a-superager"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Weintraub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-treatment-clears-plaques-from-brains-of-mice-within-hours"&gt;New Alzheimer's Treatment Clears Plaques From Brains of Mice Within Hours&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Superagers have memories beyond their 80s that rival those of people in their 50s. This study defines them as capable of remembering at least 9 words out of a list of 15 when tested, which is typical of people at least two to three decades younger. Some studies have found that &lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/stories/2017/04/scientists-have-discovered-why-some-people-are-super-agers/"&gt;less than five percent&lt;/a&gt; of the population can achieve a superager classification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/less-than-5-superagers-what-they-have-in-common-elderly-sharp-cognitive"&gt;High extroversion&lt;/a&gt; is one trait superagers have in common with each other. Oddly, superagers aren't &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/less-than-5-superagers-what-they-have-in-common-elderly-sharp-cognitive"&gt;necessarily leading healthier lifestyles&lt;/a&gt;, with some smoking and drinking alcohol regularly; a factor that suggests a significant component of these folks' age-resisting superpowers is biological.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178198" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178198" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/SuperagerWhoWasPartOfStudySitsWithWife-e1760929873749.jpg" alt="SuperAger Ralph Rehbock sits with his wife in his home.

(Shane Collins/Northwestern University)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weintraub and team monitored 290 people aged 80 and older since 2000 to compare those who would turn out to be superagers with those who age typically. Thanks also to generous donations of 79 superager brains, the researchers identified some key biological differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we realized is there are two mechanisms that lead someone to become a superager," &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/08/what-makes-a-superager"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Weintraub. "One is resistance: they don't make the plaques and tangles [typically associated with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="178196" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease]. Two is resilience: they make them, but they don't do anything to their brains."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells that deliver information to the hippocampus, known as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entorhinal_cortex"&gt;entorhinal neurons&lt;/a&gt;, were larger in superagers, possibly contributing to this resistance or resilience, the researchers suggest in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178199" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178199" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/DonatedSuperagerBrainBeingHeldInLab-e1760929713642.jpg" alt="Donated superager brain being held in lab" class="wp-image-178199 size-full" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178199" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Lab member holds a donated SuperAger brain. (Shane Collins/Northwestern University)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, typically aging people had thinning in the outer brain layer, whereas superagers did not. This area of the brain governs our conscious thoughts, memory, and language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Superagers also had more &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Economo_neuron"&gt;von Economo neurons&lt;/a&gt; and a thicker &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anterior_cingulate_cortex"&gt;anterior cingulate gyrus&lt;/a&gt;, where these neurons are found, even compared to much younger people. This part of the brain is involved in regulating attention, emotion, and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/superagers-with-incredible-memories-have-brains-like-25-year-olds"&gt;Previous studies&lt;/a&gt; already noted that this part of the brain isn't shrinking as expected in superagers.

&lt;p&gt;This brings us to the technique being used here. In this case, the researchers placed the antibody genes in a circular loop of DNA called a plasmid. This is enough to ensure that the DNA doesn’t get digested immediately and to get the antibody genes made into proteins. But it does nothing to help get the DNA inside of cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research team, a mixture of people from a biotech company and academic labs, used a commercial injection setup that mixes the injection of the DNA with short pulses of electricity. The electricity disrupts the cell membrane, allowing the plasmid DNA to make it inside cells. Based on animal testing, doing this in muscle cells is enough to turn the muscles into factories producing lots of broadly neutralizing antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study was meant to test the safety of doing that in humans. The team recruited 44 participants, testing various doses of two antibody-producing plasmids and injection schedules. All but four of the subjects completed the study; three of those who dropped out had all been testing a routine with the electric pulses happening very quickly, which turned out to be unpleasant. Fortunately, it didn’t seem to make any difference to the production of antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there were a lot of adverse reactions, most of these were associated with the injection itself: muscle pain at the site, a scab forming afterward, and a reddening of the skin. The worst problem appeared to be a single case of moderate muscle pain that persisted for a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all but one volunteer, the injection resulted in stable production of the two antibodies for at least 72 weeks following the injection; the single exception only made one of the two. That’s “at least” 72 weeks because that’s when they stopped testing—there was no indication that levels were dropping at this point. Injecting more DNA led to more variability in the amount of antibody produced, but that amount quickly maxed out. More total injections also boosted the level of antibody production. But even the minimal procedure—two injections of the lowest concentration tested—resulted in significant and stable antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Here’s something to unnerve you during your next trip to the supermarket. Research out this week shows that a substantial portion of urinary tract infections can be traced back to store-bought meat tainted with dangerous &lt;em&gt;&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/em&gt; bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers at George Washington University and others examined thousands of samples taken from people with UTIs. They found that roughly one in five infections were likely caused by foodborne strains of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. The results suggest that contaminated meat is an underappreciated source of these often miserable infections, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“These findings highlight zoonotic transmission as an important driver of UTIs,” they wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.01428-25"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in the journal mBio.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The origins of a UTI&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;UTIs are one of the most common infections around, and they’re &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/230/5/e1101/7701247"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; to result in 3 million visits to the emergency room in the U.S. alone every year. Over 80% of UTIs are &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/report/urinary-tract-infection#:~:text=Bacteria%20that%20cause%20UTIs%20include,found%20in%20feces%20(stool)."&gt;caused&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;. These bacteria are found most everywhere, including the guts of people and many of the animals that we regularly eat, though only some strains can make us sick.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The George Washington University researchers have been investigating the possibility of foodborne UTIs for quite a while.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2018, for instance, they &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/store-bought-chicken-could-be-causing-urinary-tract-inf-1828652990"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a study showing clear evidence of human UTIs caused by &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; bacteria first found in store-bought meat, especially chicken. But the researchers say it’s still been unclear just how often UTIs are likely to originate from food, particularly in major metropolitan areas. To help answer this, they teamed up with other researchers at Kaiser Permanente Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Together, they collected a large amount of &lt;em&gt;E. coli &lt;/em&gt;samples from both real-life UTI patients in Southern California and packages of retail meat, ultimately sequencing the genetics of over 5,000 samples. They then developed an algorithm, based on 17 specific genetic markers, to identify whether a particular sample of &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; originally came from animals or humans.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;All told, they found that 18% of human UTI infections diagnosed in the region between 2017 and 2023 were probably zoonotic in origin—foodborne, in other words.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Hidden meat risk&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers note that their findings are limited to a single, if large, region. So more studies should be done to quantify the extent of this issue in other parts of the country. But given their earlier research, it certainly seems likely that tainted meat plays a significant and underrecognized role in UTIs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Urinary tract infections have long been considered a personal health issue, but our findings suggest that they are also a food safety problem,” said senior study author Lance Price, a professor of environmental and occupational health at George Washington University, in a &lt;a href="https://publichealth.gwu.edu/nearly-1-5-urinary-tract-infections-linked-contaminated-meat"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The current findings might also help inform prevention efforts moving forward. The most dangerous foodborne UTI strains tended to come from chicken and turkey, for instance. And people living in low-income neighborhoods were more likely to have foodborne UTIs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the same tips used to prevent foodborne illness in general should also lower your risk of these UTIs. That includes buying meat that’s securely sealed and won’t leak onto your other groceries, thoroughly cooking your meat, and washing your hands after handling raw food.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="39" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh52nhop000a3b77a1483xv0@published"&gt;I came from a liberal background where comprehensive sex ed was standard, and I always thought I’d do the same with my kids. But things have changed, and the “talk” I’d always planned isn’t going to cut it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="156" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh53dt26000r3b777b9uc6j2@published"&gt;The current political situation has thrown me for a loop! I was prepared to answer awkward questions, provide condoms and buy Plan B like a good parent, because abstinence-only sex ed is how you end up with teen pregnancy and STDs. But I wasn’t prepared to need to cover burner phones, passports, and abortion bounty hunters! “It’s important to practice safe sex, but if you think you might be pregnant, don’t Google, pay cash for your pregnancy test, and certainly don’t tell your boyfriend because if you decide to go to Mexico to terminate, Border Patrol can search your phone and jail you and your boyfriend can turn you in for a $10,000 reward.” I’d like to think my girls are smart enough to conclude on their own that safe sex isn’t all that safe anymore, but hormones and developing brains don’t always make the best decisions. Do you have any tips for navigating this situation?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="307" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmh52nhyr000d3b7791rf3ile@published"&gt;Tell your daughters the truth, frightening as it may be. If you live in a place where abortion is illegal or severely restricted, then yes, make sure they know not to text about an unwanted pregnancy or to Google ways to terminate; you should also tell them to make sure they can fully trust their partner not to report them before sharing the news. Do your own research on where the nearest state is that provides abortions and how to go about securing care if the need arises. Make sure that your daughters know that sex always carries a risk, but that it is heightened where they live and encourage them to consider that when deciding what to do and where to go after high school. Make condoms available to them and tell them that if they wish to be sexually active, you’ll take them to get on birth control (if, hopefully, it remains available.) Acknowledge that talking to your mother about sex can be absolutely cringe-inducing, but that it would be better to endure some awkward chats than to find themselves in a difficult situation that could be avoided. Encourage them to wait until they are absolutely sure that they are ready to have sex and to only do so with a person who they can trust. Talk to them candidly about how boys often use girls for sex, or go tell others that they’ve been intimate with them. Tell them about the double standards for girls and boys and that while they shouldn’t determine what they choose to do, they may be penalized for simply honoring their desires. Make sure they are aware of what the major sexually transmitted infections are and how to obtain treatment. These are scary times indeed, but the more you share with your girls, the better prepared they will be.&lt;/p&gt;

We can sometimes have lengthy discussions on a wide range of topics. I try to answer as honestly as possible—within reason, of course, depending on whether it’s appropriate for her to know something just yet. However, I just can’t seem to come up with an appropriate response to: “What is sex?” She has asked twice now. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2017/10/dear-prudence-talking-to-your-child-about-sex.html"&gt;I freeze up and tell her we’ll talk about it when I have time to explain it properly.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Viruses are tiny — and sneaky.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So sneaky that some play a deadly game of hide and seek. The "seek" part is all too familiar: They're always looking for ways to infect humans. Their ability to hide is far less well-known and can have devastating implications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The human body holds several effective hiding spots that some of the world's nastiest viruses have discovered — like the eyes and the testes — that are beyond the reach of the immune system. It's here that submicroscopic viral RNA can safely linger.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Often the human hosts have no idea. They'd fallen ill, then appeared to beat the virus. Their blood tested negative. They show no symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;But that hidden virus is capable of springing back into action. It can emerge from hiding — either sickening the original host or slipping into semen or breast milk and infecting someone new.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Which viruses have mastered this technique? A number of notorious ones from Zika to measles to highly deadly viruses like Nipah, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/10/06/g-s1-91435/virus-marburg-deadly-disease-rwanda" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Marburg&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Lassa fever.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And the virus that terrified the world in 2014: Ebola.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the decade since, the Democratic Republic of Congo has experienced more than its fair share of Ebola crises — with nine outbreaks, including one that is ongoing — and more than its fair share of hidden viruses that spring back into action.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Almost all the outbreaks recently — maybe not every single one of them but the vast majority — are traced back to a previous outbreak," says Dr. Elizabeth Higgs, who is with the Division of Clinical Research at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. She says once the genetics of the virus are sequenced it is clear that many of the outbreaks haven't come from an animal — like a bat — but from a human who unwittingly carried the virus after surviving a previous outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While most survivors will never start a new outbreak, it is happening enough that Higgs says, "I think it's top of the research agenda."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Everybody was panicking"&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Soka Moses first grasped the significance of these virus hideouts a decade ago. It was in mid-March 2015 when people in his West African country of Liberia were heaving a collective sigh of relief.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The country was emerging from a nightmare, recalls Moses, then the medical director at an Ebola treatment center. Nearly 5,000 people died over the previous year. Some perished in the streets, unable to find a hospital bed. Schools shuttered, markets closed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Finally, in early March of 2015, there were no more Ebola cases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the crisis was not over.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Shortly after Liberia had reached zero cases, Moses recalls sitting in a daily meeting led by Liberia's National Epidemic Response Team when "boom! A case was identified." As word got out, he says: "Everybody was panicking: 'Oh, my God. Are we starting this again?'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Part of the panic was the mystery. How could this woman have contracted Ebola when there were no active cases? The virus spreads easily when someone comes into contact with an infected person's bodily fluids, even sweat or saliva, but it was not clear where or how this new patient could have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Family members eventually pointed medical investigators to the woman's sexual partner. Five months ago he'd recovered from Ebola. "[He'd] tested negative on two different occasions," says Moses. "[He was] doing perfectly fine, no symptoms whatsoever."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The man was terrified and, initially, avoided the authorities. "He thought he was in really big trouble," says Moses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Once he was reassured that he was not in trouble, he agreed to cooperate. The challenge for scientists: Find out if the virus was hiding somewhere in his body.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They ultimately determined that the Ebola virus was no longer in his blood … but lived on in his testes and had been transmitted in his semen.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"So that was the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.18584" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;first documented sexually transmitted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; case of Ebola virus disease," says Moses. While he'd read about a 1967 case in which another virus hid out in the body, the implications were now much clearer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This prompted Moses to act. He's now the director of PREVAIL or the Partnership for Research on Vaccines &amp;amp; Infectious Diseases in Liberia, which studies the phenomenon of hidden viruses, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The body's sanctuary sites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Researchers have identified a number of spots where the viruses can hide — not only eyes and testes but also the brain, the placenta and vaginal fluids as well as the mammary glands.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We call them sanctuary sites," says &lt;a href="https://www.usna.edu/NASEC/_files/documents/2023/CAPT_Joel_Montgomery.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Joel Montgomery&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, chief of the Viral Special Pathogens Branch at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For the virus, these are havens protected from the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scientists think this is likely because these body parts are critical for survival — and vulnerable to damage if the immune system overreacts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For example, "in the process of making eggs and sperm, we mix and match the genes. So they're not really us anymore," says &lt;a href="https://medicine.tulane.edu/departments/pediatrics-medicine-infectious-diseases-debakey-pediatrics-med-peds-tips-mentor/faculty" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. John Schieffelin&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor at Tulane University School of Medicine. That means the immune system might see eggs or sperm as foreign invaders and try to attack them, so it's helpful if those parts of the body are outside the reach of the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The brain has a special level of protection&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the blood brain barrier which limits the entry of immune cells. As for the eye? "An eye doctor might scold me for this, but to me, it's really an extension of the brain. There's a large nerve that goes from your eye directly into your brain," Schieffelin says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many mysteries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There's still a lot scientists don't know about how viruses behave in these sanctuary sites.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;For example, exactly how long can a virus stay there? In many cases where individuals were tested, it appears to be a matter of months. In some cases, it's years. There have even been semen samples that test negative for the virus at one point then return to positive later. It's not clear to scientists what prompted this reversal. And researchers haven't followed enough people who've harbored one of these infections long enough to know the outer limit.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another big unknown: What is the virus doing in the sanctuary site? It seems as if it's almost dormant, barely replicating. "But we don't know why someone relapses. We don't know if it's a drop in their immune system or if there's some other factor," says Montgomery.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fear and stigma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Montgomery says the goal is to identify medications for survivors that can reach into sanctuary sites and root out any hidden virus. For this, he says, the size of the molecule in the drug is key.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We really need to explore the use of small-molecule drugs," he says, suggesting the smaller the drug's molecule the more likely it can penetrate the protective barrier around a sanctuary site.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Moses' team has been studying exactly this with the drug remdesivir — and results have been promising. Survivors who got the drug cleared the virus from their semen more quickly than survivors who got the placebo.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While many of the researchers are focused on the biology, something that's never far from their mind is the psychological part of the equation. Ebola survivors can face intense fear and stigma.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When Dr. Dehkontee Dennis — who works at PREVAIL in Liberia — was enrolling for the study, she says she noticed "there was one thing that &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of these men have expressed: They have this fear. They don't want to transmit the virus to their families. They want to have children. They want to stop using condoms [to prevent transmission]."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The flip side of their fear is that many of the community members — who may have lost their partners and other family members to Ebola — fear the survivors may still pose a threat, even if they don't know about sanctuary sites. "Community members did not even want them back in the communities," says Moses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This level of stigma makes it tricky to talk about the risk that the virus could hide in a survivor and then resurface. Survivors and their community need to know there's a chance this could happen, the scientists say — but only in a small percentage of cases.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Reassurance can also come from survivor programs that test semen and vaccination campaigns to protect the community. But scientists say the solution will be finding medications that can ferret out these hidden, potentially lethal viruses.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's great that we have vaccines," says Joel Montgomery of the CDC. "It's great that we have therapeutics. It's great that we're saving people's lives. But now we need to figure out a way to make sure the virus is completely eliminated from them."&lt;/p&gt;

(CREDIT: Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breathing through your backside may sound like science fiction, but a Japanese clinical trial recently suggested that one day it might help human beings with lungs that can’t get enough oxygen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study tested whether a specialized liquid called perfluorodecalin could be safely stored in the rectum for an hour. No one was injured, and that alone is telling news. It is the first time that this “enteral ventilation” approach, based on a fish that breathes from its intestines, has been attempted on humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A strange behavior of serious beginnings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story starts with a kind of eel fish called a loach. When kept in filth, low-oxygen water, it does something strange—it swallows air and absorbs oxygen in the intestines. The strange trick caught the attention of Japanese researcher Takanori Takebe, MD, PhD, a biomedical scientist with appointments in Tokyo and at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital. At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, when ventilators had been used up in hospitals worldwide, Takebe was left wondering whether humans ever learned from the loach’s example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Graphical abstract of the study. (CREDIT: ScienceDirect Med)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notion might seem laughable, but it is science-driven. The active ingredient is odorless, colorless liquid perfluorodecalin—a perfluorocarbon that had previously been under investigation for “liquid breathing.” The liquid can hold several times more oxygen than water and has already been used safely in surgery and eye treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is simple but revolutionary: if the fluid is filled with oxygen and the gut can absorb gases, why not use the gut as an auxiliary respiratory organ in the event of lung failure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The first human test&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new trial translated that question from the lab to the clinic. The phase 1 study took place at a Japanese hospital, where it recruited young men who volunteered to inject small amounts of non-oxygenated perfluorodecalin into their rectum for an hour. Scientists were not testing whether it would save lives—but whether it was safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process was serious, not jesting. Fluid was added gradually through a soft catheter, and volunteers were monitored closely for signs of pain, shifts in vital signs, or chemical indication of the fluid in their systems. The purpose was simple: determine the amount of fluid man could hold safely and whether their bodies reacted negatively to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Takanori Takebe, MD, PhD, a biomedical scientist with appointments in Tokyo and at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital. (CREDIT: Dr. Takanori Takebe)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were surprisingly peaceful. Every one except a few tolerated the process well. Some reported bloating or cramping with higher volumes, but pain disappeared once the fluid was released. No one had negative, severe side effects, and blood tests showed no liver, kidney, or blood chemistry damage. Most significantly, the fluid didn’t intrude into the circulatory system—it stayed right where it was supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Early whispers of promise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even without added oxygen, perfluorodecalin contains more dissolved oxygen than venous blood. In theory, a small amount could diffuse through the intestinal wall and into the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers did note weak signs that this was happening, but not enough to have a clinical effect yet. That’s not surprising—this was a safety study, not a rescue experiment. But it sets up the second trial, which will use fully oxygenated liquid to see if it can measurably boost oxygen in people with low blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Takebe, who himself won an Ig Nobel Prize once—a tongue-in-cheek prize for science that “first makes people laugh, then think”—this is no joke. “Enteric ventilation might be a life-saver as a back-up mode of oxygen delivery,” he said. “Our initial results suggest that it could save patients with severe respiratory failure when conventional ventilation fails.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;SpO2 profiles for the low-, medium-, or high-dosage group Changes in time series of the SpO2 values depending on the non-oxygenated perfluorodecalin dose for each group average. (CREDIT: ScienceDirect Med)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Behind the Humor&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If future tests confirm that oxygenated perfluorodecalin can boost blood oxygen, the procedure might revolutionize the treatment of respiratory distress for doctors. In an emergency, it might save precious minutes as doctors intubate a patient or prepare a ventilator. With fragile newborn lungs, it might be a more compassionate way to deliver oxygen without causing additional harm. And in global tragedies—when hospitals drain machines—there to serve as a low-tech salvation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at EVA Therapeutics, founded by Takebe, are already planning the next round of trials in Japan. They will maximize how much liquid can be used, how long it should stay there, and how much oxygen might make its way into the blood. The hope is one day this strange-sounding solution might make a difference in quiet ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behind the humor is a vigorous warning: medical breakthroughs tend to begin with concepts that sound preposterous. After being dismissed as a curiosity, the breathing of the loach in its intestines now serves as the foundation for a potential new technique for maintaining human life.

                Two-to-three thousand soldiers from Napoleon's army were found in a mass grave in the northern suburbs of Vilnius, Lithuania in 2001.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;By 1812, Napoleon was all powerful. Nearly all of Europe was under his control. He had succeeded in forbidding most of the continent from trading with Britain in an effort to bring the island nation to heel. And he was married to Marie Louise, daughter of the emperor of Austria, a major superpower at the time. (The dazzling emerald and diamond necklace that he gifted her when they were wed was one of the objects stolen in last weekend's &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/19/nx-s1-5579509/thieves-steal-priceless-jewels-louvre" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;heist at the Louvre&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But the Russian Empire had been resisting his efforts to cut off all trade with Britain. That summer, he ordered his army, some 600,000 strong, to invade Russia. It would prove to be a terrible decision.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"This is one of the most infamous military campaigns in the last centuries," says &lt;a href="https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/microbial-paleogenomics/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nicolás Rascovan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the head of the microbial paleogenomics unit at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. "He believed that he was going to be able to conquer the whole world, more or less. It was probably the beginning of the end."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;In October, Napoleon called his soldiers back after barely engaging the Russian army. It wasn't a defeat, but it was no win either. And during the march home, winter arrived early.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They started to die of cold, hunger, and also infectious diseases," says Rascovan. All told, hundreds of thousands perished.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And in a new study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(25)01247-3" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Current Biology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Rascovan and his colleagues say those diseases likely include two unexpected pathogens that would have helped hasten the soldiers' demise.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-94828" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Combined with earlier work, it's become clear that these men were under microbial assault on all fronts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"These wars were anything but glamorous," says &lt;a href="https://www.novetus.at/#kontakt" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Michaela Binder&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a bioarchaeologist with Novetus, an archaeology company based in Vienna, who wasn't involved in the study. "For some of them, the death in battle would have been a relief."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A rich and bloody history, reconstructed&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Typhus and trench fever have long been thought to be among the afflictions that Napoleon's soldiers suffered. This is based on a mix of historical accounts, the discovery of body lice on the remains of soldiers (which carried the pathogens that transmitted the ailments), and &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-abstract/193/1/112/863741" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DNA analyses&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; conducted nearly a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But molecular techniques have improved dramatically since then.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And so a pair of archaeologists asked Rascovan, who studies the DNA of ancient pathogens, to see what other afflictions he might be able to turn up in the remains of a mass grave in Lithuania. The site had been discovered accidentally during a construction project in one the northern suburbs of Vilnius in 2001. Two-to-three thousand of Napoleon's men had been buried there soon after they died.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Europe has such a rich history that we have archaeological sites pretty much everywhere," says Rascovan. "So you dig a hole in the ground and then you find something."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-94829" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Among the remains that the archaeologists had unearthed were 13 teeth, each from a different soldier. These teeth would have had blood flowing through their interiors long ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you have DNA of the pathogen in the blood because you have an infection, that DNA can get into the tooth," explains Rascovan. "So then it's kind of a time machine in which you can really see the blood of the individual back then."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Only after decontaminating the teeth, grinding them into a powder, and dissolving the bone dust could the ancient DNA be studied. But naturally, that genetic code was in rough shape. It consisted of super short fragments that had undergone chemical changes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Rascovan sequenced all of it. Some of the genetic material came from the soldiers themselves. Some of it derived from organisms in the soil in which they were buried. And some of it — perhaps — was from pathogens that helped kill these men.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Once we have a huge list of all the different things that have been detected, we try to find which are the species that match a human pathogen," he says. "It's like doing a puzzle."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;'A story of hardship'&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After Rascovan and his team finished that puzzle, they had two hits. Both of them were bacteria: one that caused paratyphoid fever and the other relapsing fever, a pathogen transmitted by body lice that dated back to the Iron Age.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This paper shows clearly how complex these types of analyses are and the extreme level of skill required to work with these types of data," says &lt;a href="https://www.oeaw.ac.at/en/oeai/institute/team/person/leslie-quade" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Leslie Quade&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a paleopathologist at the Austrian Archaeological Institute who didn't participate in the research.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;She says that discerning the emergence, spread, and evolution of diseases in the past can also help us navigate the pathogens of today.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Understanding how certain types of pathogens developed can give us a better chance of anticipating what a pathogen's next step might be," says Quade. In addition, if a certain once-widespread pathogen has become rare today, these infection-laden historical events may offer lessons to learn to keep it from returning and to contain other similar modern pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These findings are another reminder that war has always been ugly, Binder says. "We have these paintings in the museums of soldiers in shiny armors, of Napoleon on his horse, fit young men marching into battle."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"But in the end, when we look at the human remains, we see an entirely different picture," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's a picture of lifelong malnutrition, broken feet from marching too far, too quickly, and bodies riddled with disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Their bones tell a story of hardship," says Binder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These microscopic clusters, known as alpha-synuclein oligomers, have long been suspected as the starting point for Parkinson's, but they have remained undetectable in human brain tissue -- until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team from the University of Cambridge, UCL, the Francis Crick Institute, and Polytechnique Montréal developed a powerful imaging approach that allows scientists to visualize, count, and compare these protein clumps in human brain tissue. One researcher described the breakthrough as "like being able to see stars in broad daylight."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;, the findings could transform how scientists study Parkinson's, offering new insights into how it spreads through the brain and paving the way for earlier diagnosis and more targeted treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parkinson's: A Growing Global Health Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 166,000 people in the UK currently live with Parkinson's disease, and the global total is expected to reach 25 million by 2050. While existing drugs can ease symptoms such as tremors and stiffness, none can halt or slow the disease's progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For over a century, doctors have identified Parkinson's by the presence of large protein deposits known as Lewy bodies. Yet researchers have long believed that smaller, early-stage oligomers may actually cause the damage to brain cells. Until now, these microscopic structures, just a few nanometers long, were impossible to observe directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seeing Parkinson's at Its Earliest Stages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Lewy bodies are the hallmark of Parkinson's, but they essentially tell you where the disease has been, not where it is right now," said Professor Steven Lee from Cambridge's Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, who co-led the research. "If we can observe Parkinson's at its earliest stages, that would tell us a whole lot more about how the disease develops in the brain and how we might be able to treat it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, the researchers created a method called ASA-PD (Advanced Sensing of Aggregates for Parkinson's Disease). This ultra-sensitive fluorescence microscopy technique can detect and analyze millions of oligomers in post-mortem brain samples. Because the oligomers are so tiny, their signal is faint, but ASA-PD enhances that signal while reducing background noise, allowing scientists to clearly see individual alpha-synuclein clusters for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Illuminating the Invisible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is the first time we've been able to look at oligomers directly in human brain tissue at this scale: it's like being able to see stars in broad daylight," said co-first author Dr Rebecca Andrews, who conducted the work when she was a postdoctoral researcher in Lee's lab. "It opens new doors in Parkinson's research."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers examined brain tissue from people with Parkinson's and compared it to samples from healthy individuals of similar age. They found that oligomers were present in both groups, but in those with Parkinson's, the clusters were larger, brighter, and far more numerous. This difference suggests a strong connection between oligomer growth and disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clues to the Earliest Signs of Disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also identified a unique subset of oligomers found only in Parkinson's patients, which may represent the earliest detectable signs of the disease -- possibly appearing years before symptoms emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This method doesn't just give us a snapshot," said Professor Lucien Weiss from Polytechnique Montréal, wo co-led the research. "It offers a whole atlas of protein changes across the brain and similar technologies could be applied to other neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Huntington's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Oligomers have been the needle in the haystack, but now that we know where those needles are, it could help us target specific cell types in certain regions of the brain."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A New Window Into the Human Brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The only real way to understand what is happening in human disease is to study the human brain directly, but because of the brain's sheer complexity, this is very challenging," said Professor Sonia Gandhi from The Francis Crick Institute, who co-led the research. "We hope that breaking through this technological barrier will allow us to understand why, where and how protein clusters form and how this changes the brain environment and leads to disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research was made possible with support from Aligning Science Across Parkinson's (ASAP), the Michael J. Fox Foundation, and the Medical Research Council (MRC), part of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). The team expressed gratitude to the patients, families, and caregivers who donated brain tissue to research, enabling discoveries like this to advance understanding and potential treatment of Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even as we drift into what feels like unconscious rest, our brains might not be entirely asleep. According to the study &lt;em&gt;DREAM: The Dream EEG and Mentation Database&lt;/em&gt;, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, parts of the brain can remain alert during even the deepest stages of sleep — and dreaming may not be limited to REM sleep after all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This large-scale, international collaboration brings together decades of dream research into one unified, open-access platform. Coordinated by &lt;em&gt;Monash University&lt;/em&gt; in Australia, the DREAM project analyzed 2,643 awakenings from 505 volunteers, drawing data from 20 separate studies across 13 countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Dreams Beyond REM: Sleep Is Less Silent Than It Seems&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For years, REM sleep was viewed as the exclusive domain of dreaming — marked by vivid imagery, muscle paralysis, and rapid eye movements. But the data in DREAM challenge this assumption. Among the 2,643 awakenings, participants reported having dream experiences in about 85% of REM cases, but also in a surprising 40% to 60% of NREM (non-REM) awakenings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even during slow-wave sleep — the deepest and most restorative phase — some individuals described emotional thoughts or fragmented sensations. The researchers examined the final 30 seconds of brain activity before each awakening, using &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61945-1" target="_blank" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61945-1" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EEG and MEG technologies&lt;/a&gt; to capture electrical and magnetic patterns in the brain. What they found was surprising: in NREM dreams, brain waves began to show faster, smaller oscillations, mimicking the patterns of quiet wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other words, the brain — or at least &lt;em&gt;part of it&lt;/em&gt; — may temporarily enter an “awake-like” state, despite the body remaining deeply asleep. These episodes may reflect &lt;strong&gt;brief bursts of conscious processing&lt;/strong&gt;, supporting the idea that consciousness during sleep is more of a spectrum than a switch.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Artificial Intelligence Learns to Read Dreams&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The strength of the &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/five-fingers-dream-of-mao-zedong/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="62726" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;DREAM&lt;/a&gt; project lies not only in the scale of its data, but in its methodology. Each awakening in the study was classified into one of three categories:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an &lt;em&gt;experience&lt;/em&gt; (a clear dream),&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;an &lt;em&gt;experience without recall&lt;/em&gt; (often called a &lt;strong&gt;white dream&lt;/strong&gt;),&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;or &lt;em&gt;no experience&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This triage system allowed researchers to train artificial intelligence models to predict whether a person had been dreaming based on brain activity alone. Simpler brain-wave features gave moderate accuracy in detecting dreams during deep NREM sleep, while more complex models improved accuracy during REM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As reported by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/is-our-brain-ever-fully-asleep-it-may-stay-awake-even-as-we-dream-48184" target="_blank" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.discovermagazine.com/is-our-brain-ever-fully-asleep-it-may-stay-awake-even-as-we-dream-48184" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Discover Magazine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, this is one of the first large-scale efforts to develop non-invasive dream detection tools. With further refinement, such technology could be used to monitor consciousness during sleep — or even serve as an early marker for cognitive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In fact, other research referenced in the article suggests that difficulty reaching REM sleep may signal an early warning sign for Alzheimer’s disease, hinting at a broader medical relevance for sleep-stage mapping and dream monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As co-author &lt;em&gt;Giulio Bernardi&lt;/em&gt; noted in a press release, &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The work presented in the article, coordinated by Monash University (Australia), resulted from the efforts of 53 authors from 37 institutions across 13 countries, and represents a decisive step in the scientific exploration of human consciousness by bringing together and making decades of dream research available in one place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Once again, his brother told him off. Apparently, getting to the bottom of what this trampoline is all about is a one-dog job, LOL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After this extravaganza had gone on for quite some time, the other Golden Retriever brother decided to try reaching under the trampoline, at which point they succeeded in retrieving a small orange ball that had gotten stuck underneath it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And so ended the great Golden Retriever trampoline mystery of October 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;These Dogs Share a Single Brain Cell&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As this other video shows, there can be no doubt that these adorable Golden Retriever brothers share a single brain cell.

How many licks does it take for a Golden Retriever to get to the center of the Tootsie Pop?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;How many times will these affable, yet hapless, dogs lose a ball under the trampoline and then try pushing their way through it, bouncing up and down without success, before they remember that all they have to do is reach under the trampoline to retrieve their ball, just like they did last time?

It might feel harmless, but missing out on proper rest has a quiet way of affecting almost every part of your body. Sleep is not just downtime; it’s when your body repairs, restores and resets itself. When you sleep less than you should, your heart, brain, and metabolism start to pay the price. Over time, poor sleep can build up into serious health problems. Here’s a clear look at how a lack of sleep harms your physical and mental well-being, and why getting those seven to nine hours truly matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What really happens to your body when you don’t get enough sleep&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sleep deprivation increases your risk of heart disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most worrying effects of sleep loss is how it strains your heart. A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12116485/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study published in the American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; found that short sleep duration is strongly linked to higher risks of cardiovascular disease, including hypertension, stroke and coronary heart disease. According to this study, both sleeping too little and too much can increase the risk of early death, but short sleep, less than seven hours a night, is the bigger threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Fix Your Sleep Naturally! Sadhguru’s 5-Step Routine for Deep Rest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you don’t sleep enough, your body stays in a mild state of stress. Your blood pressure remains high, your heart rate increases, and the body releases more stress hormones like cortisol. These reactions might not seem like much in the short term, but over weeks and months, they wear down your cardiovascular system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who regularly sleep under six hours are about 1.6 times more likely to develop hypertension than those who get adequate rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This problem becomes worse with age. Older adults who already have health conditions are more vulnerable, but studies also show that younger adults who sleep less are at a 25% higher risk of developing long-term heart problems. Simply put, your heart needs rest as much as your mind does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Poor sleep habits can slow your metabolism and cause obesity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor sleep doesn’t just make you tired; it affects how your body manages food and energy. Short sleep duration changes how your hormones work. It lowers leptin (which helps you feel full) and raises ghrelin (which makes you hungry). As a result, you crave more food, especially sugary or high-carb snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several reviews have confirmed a U-shaped relationship between sleep duration and obesity risk. This means that sleeping less than six hours or more than nine hours increases your chances of gaining weight. People with sleep deprivation are around 1.5 times more likely to become obese than those who sleep normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your blood sugar also takes a hit. Lack of sleep reduces insulin sensitivity, meaning your body struggles to regulate glucose levels. Over time, this can lead to type 2 diabetes. Some studies even show that men who consistently sleep less than six hours face a higher diabetes risk than women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The takeaway is simple; your metabolism depends on rest. Even with a good diet and exercise, chronic sleep loss can undo your progress by altering how your body stores fat and uses energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Lack of sleep triggers anxiety, stress, and emotional burnout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever been irritable after a poor night’s sleep, you’ve seen how closely sleep and emotions are tied. But the effects go deeper than just being grumpy or tired. According to various reviews, chronic sleep deprivation increases anxiety, emotional instability, and depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you don’t get enough rest, your brain’s ability to regulate emotions weakens. The amygdala, responsible for processing emotions, becomes overactive, while areas that control judgment and calm responses slow down. This imbalance makes it easier to feel overwhelmed, anxious, or angry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some studies found that people who consistently sleep less report higher levels of stress hormones and lower emotional resilience. Over time, poor sleep can also impact relationships and social life. It reduces patience, empathy and focus, all vital for maintaining healthy connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health experts now consider sleep loss not just a symptom of stress or depression, but also a contributing cause. Getting adequate rest improves your ability to handle stress and regulate emotions, making it a key part of emotional well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Building better sleep habits: How to fix your routine for long-term health&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that sleep habits can be improved with simple lifestyle changes. You don’t need special supplements or devices; just consistency and awareness. Health researchers recommend adults sleep for seven to nine hours per night, and older adults for at least seven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Here are a few practical ways to restore healthy sleep patterns:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stick to a schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid screens before bed. Blue light from phones and laptops delays melatonin release, making it harder to fall asleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limit caffeine and heavy meals at night. Both can disrupt your body’s natural rest rhythm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep your room cool and quiet. A comfortable environment improves sleep quality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wind down. Try reading, meditation, or light stretching before bed to signal your body it’s time to rest.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts also suggest that workplaces and schools need to recognise sleep as part of overall well-being. Adjusting schedules, promoting flexible work hours, and discouraging late-night work can go a long way in improving community health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of sleep doesn’t just make you tired; it affects nearly every system in your body. From raising blood pressure and blood sugar levels to influencing mood and weight, the effects are wide and serious. The evidence clearly shows that consistent, quality sleep is essential for good health. It supports your heart, metabolism and mental stability. If you’re sleeping less than seven hours most nights, it’s worth taking a step back and rethinking your routine.

The infection often remains asymptomatic, allowing the bacteria to persist for years, but it can lead to ulcers and, in severe cases, gastric cancer. High-risk populations include people in East Asia, Eastern Europe, South America, older adults, and those with certain dietary habits or family history. Early detection, lifestyle modifications, and targeted treatment can prevent infection-related cancer and reduce the global burden of stomach cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;H. pylori bacteria and their role in &lt;keyword id="20349122" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="stomach-cancer-risk" source="Orion"&gt;stomach cancer risk&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common bacterium, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), has been linked to a significant proportion of stomach cancer cases worldwide. According to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03793-6" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;a study published in Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, nearly 76% of gastric cancers may be attributable to this bacterium. Researchers estimate that approximately 16 million people born between 2008 and 2017 could develop stomach cancer in their lifetime, with around 12 million of these cases directly linked to H. pylori.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Cancer is curable if detected early: Signs to pay attention to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;H. pylori lives in the stomach lining and can silently persist for years without producing noticeable symptoms. While most people remain unaware of its presence, the bacterium can sometimes lead to peptic ulcers and, in severe cases, gastric cancer. Asia is projected to account for the majority of H. pylori-related cases, with nearly 8 million expected, while North and South America may see about 1.5 million cases combined. Understanding the role of H. pylori in stomach cancer is vital because it identifies a largely preventable risk factor. Unlike cancers caused by genetics or lifestyle alone, early detection and treatment of H. pylori infection can dramatically reduce future gastric cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who is most at risk of H. pylori infection and gastric cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain populations are more vulnerable to H. pylori-related stomach cancer. People living in high-prevalence regions, particularly East Asia, Eastern Europe, and parts of South America, face a higher lifetime risk. First-generation immigrants from these regions may also carry the bacteria if they were infected during childhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other risk factors include a family history of stomach cancer, older age, smoking, obesity, and diets high in salted, smoked, or processed foods. Adults over 60 are especially susceptible, and some genetic predispositions can further increase vulnerability. High-risk individuals should remain vigilant and consider screening for H. pylori if symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Signs and &lt;keyword id="29822654" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="symptoms-of-H-pylori" source="Orion"&gt;symptoms of H. pylori&lt;/keyword&gt; infection to watch for&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;H. pylori often develops in childhood and remains dormant for years. Although many carriers never experience symptoms, about 30% develop complications such as ulcers or gastritis. Common warning signs include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Burning stomach pain or discomfort&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Feeling full quickly after meals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nausea or frequent burping&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Unexplained weight loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Indigestion and bloating&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the bacteria can go undetected for years, persistent digestive discomfort should never be ignored. Timely medical evaluation can prevent serious complications and lower the risk of gastric cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prevention and lifestyle changes to lower stomach cancer risk&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although H. pylori is a major risk factor, lifestyle and preventive measures can significantly reduce the likelihood of developing stomach cancer. Key steps include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintaining a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Regular physical activity to support overall health&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoiding or quitting smoking, which compounds gastric cancer risk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Limiting alcohol consumption&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seeking a timely medical evaluation for persistent digestive symptoms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community awareness is also crucial. Educating families about the bacteria, safe hygiene practices, and risk factors can reduce transmission and promote early detection, particularly in high-prevalence regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Screening, diagnosis, and treatment options for H. pylori&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Screening for H. pylori infection can be done using breath tests, stool tests, or blood antibody tests, while in some cases, an endoscopy may be recommended to examine the stomach lining more closely. If the bacteria are detected, treatment typically involves a combination of antibiotics and proton pump inhibitors to eradicate the infection and allow the stomach lining to heal. Although routine screening is not advised for populations in countries with low stomach cancer rates, high-risk individuals, including those with a family history, older adults, or people from regions with high prevalence, should undergo testing. Family members may also require evaluation, as the infection can spread within households. Early detection and timely treatment can prevent ulcers, reduce gastric cancer risk, and address a largely preventable cause of this disease.

A &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6770596/"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt; titled 'Sodium Intake and Hypertension' found on PubMed Central reads, "A reduction in salt intake can have a favourable effect on the cardiovascular system, inducing a reduction in BP values in hypertensive patients, but also with possible benefits in the vascular function and in the viscoelastic properties of the large arteries."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, avoid adding salt in cooking or reduce it from your diet as much as possible. Also, read food labels to identify hidden sodium (which is generally found in processed foods, sauces, canned meals) and avoid such foods. The goal is to reduce the “extra” salt you add, because even small reductions, like 1 teaspoon per day, can impact your BP, according to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/changes-you-can-make-to-manage-high-blood-pressure/shaking-the-salt-habit-to-lower-high-blood-pressure"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 11:46:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>这种饮料可以修复你的肝脏，平衡荷尔蒙，甚至对抗癌症-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/this-one-drink-could-fix-your-liver-balance-hormones-and-even-fight-cancer/articleshow/124765863.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;div class="MwN2O"&gt;&lt;div class="vdo_embedd"&gt; &lt;div class="T22zO"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;While they might be extremely difficult and tiring to peel, and this may be the reason you've been avoiding adding them to your grocery list, pomegranates are one of the healthiest fruits out there.

They are said to have non-coeliac gluten sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We wanted to understand whether gluten itself, or other factors, truly cause their symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What we did and what we found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our study combined more than 58 studies covering symptom changes and possible ways they could arise. These included studying the immune system, gut barrier, microbes in the gut, and psychological explanations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across studies, gluten-specific reactions were uncommon and, when they occurred, changes in symptoms were usually small. Many participants who believed they were "gluten sensitive" reacted equally – or more strongly – to a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="178903" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2013.04.051"&gt;One landmark trial&lt;/a&gt; looked at the role of fermentable carbohydrates (known as FODMAPs) in people who said they were sensitive to gluten (but didn't have coeliac disease). When people ate &lt;a href="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/high-and-low-fodmap-foods/"&gt;a low-FODMAP diet&lt;/a&gt; – avoiding foods such as certain fruits, vegetables, legumes, and cereals – their symptoms improved, even when gluten was reintroduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2017.10.040"&gt;Another showed&lt;/a&gt; fructans – a type of FODMAP in wheat, onion, garlic, and other foods – caused more bloating and discomfort than gluten itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178919" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178919" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/onion_garlic_642.jpg" alt="onions and garlic" class="wp-image-178919 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/onion_garlic_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/onion_garlic_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178919" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A fermentable carbohydrate in onions and garlic caused more problems than gluten.

This could be FODMAPs such as fructans or other wheat proteins. Another explanation could be that symptoms reflect a disorder in how the gut interacts with the brain, similar to irritable bowel syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some people may be truly sensitive to gluten. However, current evidence suggests this is uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;People expected symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A consistent finding is how expecting to have symptoms profoundly shapes people's symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-1253(23)00317-5"&gt;In blinded trials&lt;/a&gt;, when people unknowingly ate gluten or placebo, symptom differences &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-1253(25)00090-1"&gt;almost vanished&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some who expected gluten to make them unwell developed identical discomfort when exposed to a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg" alt="Win a $10,000 Space Coast Adventure Holiday" class="alignnone wp-image-177074 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Astro.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This nocebo effect – the negative counterpart of placebo – shows that belief and prior experience influence how the brain processes signals from the gut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118229"&gt;Brain-imaging research&lt;/a&gt; supports this, showing that expectation and emotion activate brain regions involved in pain and how we perceive threats. This can heighten sensitivity to normal gut sensations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are real physiological responses. What the evidence is telling us is that focusing attention on the gut, coupled with anxiety about symptoms or repeated negative experiences with food, has real effects. This can sensitise how the gut interacts with the brain (known as the gut–brain axis) so normal digestive sensations are felt as pain or urgency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_178924" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-178924" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/brain_scan_expectation_642.jpg" alt="brain scans" class="wp-image-178924 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/brain_scan_expectation_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/brain_scan_expectation_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-178924" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Brain scans show expectation can activate regions involving pain. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADnBGtNmtE/"&gt;LarisaBozhikova/Getty Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognising this psychological contribution doesn't mean symptoms are imagined. When the brain predicts a meal may cause harm, gut sensory pathways amplify every cramp or sensation of discomfort, creating genuine distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This helps explain why people remain convinced gluten is to blame even when blinded studies show otherwise. Symptoms are real, but the mechanism is often driven by expectation rather than gluten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what else could explain why some people feel better after going gluten-free? Such a change in the diet also reduces &lt;a href="https://www.monashfodmap.com/about-fodmap-and-ibs/high-and-low-fodmap-foods/"&gt;high-FODMAP foods&lt;/a&gt; and ultra-processed products, encourages mindful eating and offers a sense of control. All these can improve our well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People also tend to eat more naturally gluten-free, nutrient-dense foods such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, and nuts, which may further support gut health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The cost of going gluten-free&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cgh.2017.06.037"&gt;approximately 1% of the population&lt;/a&gt; with coeliac disease, avoiding gluten for life is essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for most who feel better gluten-free, gluten is unlikely to be the true problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's also a cost to going gluten-free unnecessarily. Gluten-free foods are, on average, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.gastro.2024.02.051"&gt;139% more expensive&lt;/a&gt; than standard ones. They are also often lower in fibre and key nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avoiding gluten long-term can also reduce diversity in your diet, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2018.03.017"&gt;alter your gut microbes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.14258"&gt;reinforce anxiety about eating&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is it worth getting tested?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike coeliac disease or a wheat allergy, non-coeliac gluten sensitivity has no biomarker – there's no blood test or tissue marker that can confirm it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnosis instead relies on excluding other conditions and structured dietary testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on our review, we recommend clinicians:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;rule out coeliac disease and wheat allergy first&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;optimise the quality of someone's overall diet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;trial a low-FODMAP diet if symptoms persist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;only then, consider a four to six-week dietitian-supervised gluten-free trial, followed by a structured reintroduction of gluten-containing foods to see whether gluten truly causes symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach keeps restriction targeted and temporary, avoiding unnecessary long-term exclusion of gluten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If gluten doesn't explain someone's symptoms, combining dietary guidance with psychological support often works best. That's because expectation, stress, and emotion influence our symptoms. Cognitive-behavioural or exposure-based therapies can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2014.01.007"&gt;reduce food-related fear&lt;/a&gt; and help people safely reintroduce foods they once avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This integrated model moves beyond the simplistic "gluten is bad" narrative toward personalised, evidence-based gut–brain care.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/267098/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

"Choose organic produce when possible, use protective gear if you’re working with chemicals, and drink filtered water to avoid contaminants."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;No. 4: Prioritize sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During deep sleep, the brain clears out waste products and repairs itself, Michalopoulos noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chronic sleep deprivation or conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/sleep-disorders" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt; can increase the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s," he said. "Stick to a consistent sleep schedule, avoid screens before bed and create a calming bedtime routine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/even-small-amounts-alcohol-linked-higher-dementia-risk-older-adults-study-shows" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EVEN SMALL AMOUNTS OF ALCOHOL LINKED TO HIGHER DEMENTIA RISK IN OLDER ADULTS, STUDY SHOWS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Vibhash Sharma, a neurologist and medical director of UT Southwestern’s neuromodulation movement disorders clinic in Dallas, Texas, reiterated the importance of quality sleep for Parkinson’s prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As poor sleep quality and chronic sleep deprivation are associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative disease, quality and adequate sleep is important for supporting brain repair and clearing abnormal proteins linked to Parkinson’s disease," he told Fox News Digital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;No. 5: Manage stress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress is a part of life, but &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health/stress-and-anxiety" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;chronic levels&lt;/a&gt; can take a toll on your brain, Picone cautioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://foxnews.onelink.me/xLDS?pid=AppArticleLink&amp;amp;af_dp=foxnewsaf%3A%2F%2F&amp;amp;af_web_dp=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fapps-products" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It’s been linked to inflammation and oxidative stress, both of which are thought to play a role in Parkinson’s," she said.

            A type of mosquito that was believed to have evolved in the London Underground has a much older origin in the Mediterranean, according to a new genetic study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00023d60cr43gqeu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The myth originated during World War II when Londoners sheltering from German warplanes in subway stations had to endure bites from mosquitoes. The pests were so well adapted to the city’s subterranean tunnels that, in the following decades, biologists started to suggest they might have evolved down there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00033d608cjvbmpo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The mosquito in question is commonly known as the northern house mosquito, and it exists in two forms, identical in appearance but different in behavior. One is called Culex pipiens form pipiens, which only bites birds and lives in open air environments, and the other is called Culex pipiens form&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;molestus — from the Latin word for annoying — which bites humans and thrives belowground.

            It was the latter variant, some biologists thought, that could have adapted to thrive in London’s Tube stations. “That theory was made really famous by a genetic study published in 1999, which claimed, based on what I would say was limited evidence, that the ‘London Underground mosquito’ seemed to have evolved (on site) from aboveground population,” said Yuki Haba, a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University and first author of the new study that &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ady4515?adobe_mc=MCMID=32040115521268807963986547309462626171%25257CMCORGID=242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%25252540AdobeOrg%25257CTS=1761227097" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Thursday in the journal Science.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In the study, Haba and his colleagues analyzed the DNA sequences of hundreds of mosquitoes from all over the world, including some historical samples that were alive during World War II, and concluded that molestus did not rapidly evolve below the surface of the English capital but has a much longer history.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00063d60x4oyxi69@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a lot older than the London Tube, and it seems to have evolved around the Mediterranean region, particularly in the Middle Eastern region,” said Haba, adding that the split between the aboveground pipiens and the belowground molestus could have occurred as early as 10,000 years ago, and as late as 1,000 years ago, but most likely between 3,000 and 2,000 years ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00073d60vfnq3jsn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The evolutionary analysis suggests that those ancestral molestus populations were aboveground,” he added, “and they kind of gradually dispersed to other places of the world, including the London Underground.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe00093d602tlzq08j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The team’s quest to test the “London Underground mosquito” hypothesis rigorously started in 2018. “We literally googled Culex pipiens and emailed every author of every paper that we found about the mosquito, telling them we needed samples to understand the origin and genetic diversity of the species,” Haba said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000a3d60avpflu6o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Thousands of emails and a few years later, the researchers had collected dead mosquitoes — preserved in ethanol — from more than 200 sources across 50 countries. They couldn’t get any live ones from the London Underground itself, as the scientists were denied permission to collect insects directly from the Tube. They instead used historical samples collected throughout the 1900s, conserved at London’s Natural History Museum and analyzed by the Wellcome Sanger Institute, a genomics research center.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000b3d604zjes5f3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In total, the researchers analyzed 357 contemporary mosquitoes and 22 historical specimens, and used additional mosquito samples from a separate study, which beefed up the overall count to about 800.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000c3d60e5utgax3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our data shows that molestus is descended directly from pipiens populations that still thrive in the Mediterranean region,” said Lindy McBride, senior author of the study and an associate professor of evolutionary genomics and neuroscience at Princeton University. This finding suggests that it “evolved at Mediterranean latitudes, but probably in the Middle East, where it’s actually too arid for the bird-biting variant to exist.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000d3d60oxin9equ@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At roughly that time, people in the area were starting to create agricultural communities that used irrigation systems, providing ideal places for the mosquito to breed and enabling it to colonize these arid areas and then adapt to humans, McBride said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000e3d60k07xmk17@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The findings are corroborated by the fact that molestus was first &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3426333/" target="_blank"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; as a species in 1775 in Egypt by naturalist Peter Forsskål. “It had probably been there for 1,000 years, at least, before that,” McBride said. “It was then documented in southern Europe in two places, Croatia and Italy, in the 1800s and then the first records from belowground sites in Northern Europe are from about 1920.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000f3d60iryuy50o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This sequences of detection suggest that molestus traveled north, and once it hit climates too cold to survive in the open, it found refuge underground. “They can’t survive the cold winter, so they would have been confined to southern France, Italy, Greece, Spain,” McBride said. “They couldn’t have gotten much further north than that until there were underground structures to occupy during the winter.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000g3d6017nfk1ja@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are over 3,000 species of mosquitoes, and they have by now colonized every continent except Antarctica. A mosquito was just found for the first time in Iceland, a country previously believed to be free of the insects due to its cold climate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Richard Nichols, a professor of genetics at Queen Mary University of London, was not involved with the research but was one of the authors of the 1999 paper that popularized the “London Underground mosquito” hypothesis. Nichols said in an email that he thinks the new study is wonderful and convincing, and although it comes to different conclusions than his own research, “that’s how science works.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000j3d60rbhirb28@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The 1999 study, he continued, showed that the underground mosquitoes in London were genetically distinct from the aboveground populations, and had distinguishing characteristics that helped them live underground, such as the ability to go through the life cycle without a blood meal, indiscriminate biting when the opportunity arose, and an ability to mate in confined spaces and breed throughout the year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000k3d604iio6tm7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We interpreted these results to imply that some of the above underground population had adapted to the London (Tube) system and become reproductively isolated from them,” he said, acknowledging that the data from the new study, which is sourced from more places and has greater genetic diversity, reveals new information that was not available at the time. “In those days we could only readily survey 20 genes — not whole genomes,” he explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000l3d60w124hfbd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our results still stand, but the interpretation has changed.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000m3d60vzsl76i8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cameron Webb, an associate professor of medical entomology at the University of Sydney and NSW Health Pathology in Australia, called it a fascinating and comprehensive study of the evolution of this globally important mosquito. “While often portrayed as having adapted specifically to the London Underground, this mosquito is actually well known to be associated with subterranean habitats around the world,” Webb, who was not involved with the work but has conducted research on molestus mosquitoes, wrote in an email. The study demonstrates the ancestral basis for the ability of this mosquito to exploit the London Underground, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmh3ratfe000n3d6010wyn7z0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The “London Underground mosquito” highlights the need to better understand the biology of less-studied mosquitoes to see how they may exploit the changing urban landscape and bring with them increased pest and public health concerns, Webb concluded. “As the design of our cities adapts in response to a changing climate, we must ensure we don’t create more opportunities for mosquitoes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

I have no underlying health issues except slightly high blood pressure. I have had all the COVID vaccines that have been offered. I did have a slight case of COVID in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;I received the 2024-25 COVID vaccine on Aug. 1. Then they came up with an updated version for 2025-26. I would need to wait two months to get another vaccination. Is it worth getting the updated version to protect me this coming winter, or would this be "overkill"?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— C.R.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear C.R.:&lt;/strong&gt; The 2024-25 vaccine has activity against the variants of the COVID vaccine that are circulating now, so you did get some benefit from the vaccine. The 2025-26 vaccines are intended to provide better protection against the strains that are expected to circulate in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;At age 80, you are at an increased risk from COVID-19, but the fact that you have had all the vaccines, including the most recent one in August, does mean that you have protection from severe COVID. If you had an immune system disease, chronic heart/lung disease, or other conditions, I would definitely advise that you get the new vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The downside of getting the new vaccine as soon as possible is a sore arm and maybe foregoing additional protection in early 2026. You could get it now or in a few months if the amount of the virus is high in your community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Dr. Roach:&lt;/strong&gt; What do you think of the Sinclair Method for dealing with an alcoholic?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;— M.D.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear M.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; Naltrexone is approved for the treatment of alcohol use disorder under the Food and Drug Adminstration. (The terms "alcoholic" and "alcoholism" aren't used in a medical sense anymore. They seem to be judgmental and downplay the fact that this condition can be successfully treated.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Sinclair Method uses naltrexone, a medication that is often used for the treatment of opioid use disorder, to reduce the enjoyment people get with consuming alcohol, which makes for less cravings and more control over drinking. A major advantage of this method, which is used by many programs, is that it does not require total abstinence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;This can be beneficial for some people who feel awkward in social situations where drinking is considered normal. The treatment only works as long as people are using naltrexone. In the Sinclair Method, naltrexone is not necessarily given every day, only when a person is going into a situation where they will be drinking. This can be especially helpful in a person who intends to have one drink but ends up drinking more than they want to, especially when they "binge" (4 or more drinks for a woman, 5 or more for a man).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Naltrexone can be given every day by mouth or as an injection every four weeks. Although most people have few side effects, some side effects and liver problems can occur, so monitoring blood tests periodically is recommended when people are using naltrexone daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Naltrexone cannot be given to people who are being treated with opiates for pain as it will make the opiates ineffective. Naltrexone is also given to people with opioid use disorder for the very same reason it is used for alcohol: to reduce the pleasure "reward" from using it. It has been used in other situations as well, such as gambling and overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In my opinion, medication therapy is underused for people with moderate or severe alcohol use disorder. The long-term consequences of continued heavy drinking are immense for a person's physical and mental health, their social and family life, and employment. Naltrexone is one of several medications that are effective at helping people reduce or stop excess alcohol use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Many regular doctors are comfortable prescribing medication treatment for alcohol use disorder, but an addiction specialist is the expert in this case.&lt;em&gt; Readers may email questions to ToYourGoodHealth@med.cornell.edu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 09:02:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxQcExfTmNwWWI4NFFGNWxsNnkwVTdTRzFray1DRFNQcHBRZzdOS09fMXNLNUo5TFpwYTUxV0NZMFpxUXRYaVZVdDRxUUVvTVAzaDVCM2pDaGJtNlNDTnVBRHpvRUNSUl9TUDJUNVBNYnZUUFpUN0lfOW9lbXQ5c2o3Y3Q3eENYeWhIZ2NSX09iY2FJVWhwN21ORXI5TlRkSGZRR28xR1B4T2tid3dNMzEzbVg0YW9iT1g4SUJnNEExcF9WNF9CVVhpWQ</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，即使鳞片没有移动， Semaglutide也能帮助您的心脏- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/semaglutide-helps-your-heart-even-if-the-scale-doesnt-budge-study-shows-2000676206</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl "&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The benefits of semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, aren’t just limited to treating obesity. New research shows that semaglutide can protect people’s hearts regardless of how many pounds they lose while taking it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists examined data from a large-scale clinical trial of people with obesity and pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Compared to people on placebo, they found, those on semaglutide were less likely to develop heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems—even when people hadn’t lost much weight at all. The results indicate that semaglutide can improve heart health in more than one way, the researchers and outside experts say.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The findings “highlight that the cardioprotective effects of semaglutide may be independent of adiposity and weight loss,” Laurence Sperling, a preventive cardiologist at Emory University not affiliated with the study, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Good for the heart&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Semaglutide and other GLP-1 drugs have heralded a new era of obesity (and diabetes) treatment. But for a time, it was unclear if these drugs would also improve people’s cardiovascular health, and to what extent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk (the makers of Ozempic and Wegovy) funded a large, randomized, controlled, and double-blinded study designed to answer that open question—the SELECT trial. It involved roughly 17,000 people with obesity and a history of cardiovascular disease, who were followed for up to five years. The primary results from the SELECT trial, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2307563"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; almost two years ago, showed that high-dose semaglutide (the version approved as Wegovy for treating obesity) reduced people’s risk of heart attacks and other major cardiovascular events by 20% during the study period. Based on these findings, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-treatment-reduce-risk-serious-heart-problems-specifically-adults-obesity-or"&gt;expanded&lt;/a&gt; its approval of Wegovy to also cover the prevention of cardiovascular disease in high-risk groups.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since obesity is known to increase the risk of heart disease, it’s easy to assume that semaglutide’s heart benefits are mostly tied to helping people lose weight. But &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1050173824000197"&gt;some evidence&lt;/a&gt; has already suggested it’s more complicated than that. In this new research, some of the researchers who conducted the SELECT trial took a closer look at their data.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;They ultimately found no clear relationship between how much weight someone had lost early into the study (20 weeks in) and their reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The heart-protective benefits of semaglutide were also largely the same across different baseline weight groups. In other words, someone who was overweight (a body mass index between 27 and 30) at the start of the study tended to see a similar reduction in heart disease risk as compared to someone with the highest level of obesity (a BMI over 40).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This gives us important information that maybe we should be looking at the indication for these drugs beyond just whether your BMI is more than 27,” Howard Weintraub, preventive cardiologist and clinical director at the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at NYU Langone Heart, told Gizmodo. Weintraub was one of the lead researchers of the original SELECT trial but wasn’t involved in the new research.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The study did see an association between someone’s waist circumference throughout the study and heart disease risk. The more a person’s waist shrunk, for instance, the greater reduction in risk they had. Waist circumference is another measure of excess body fat. So semaglutide’s slimming of body fat does seem to help explain why it prevents heart disease—but only partly. The researchers estimated that just a third of semaglutide’s effect on lowering cardiovascular disease could be accounted for by a trimming waistline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings were &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01375-3/fulltext"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in The Lancet.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Beyond weight loss&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The authors say these findings could have far-reaching implications for how semaglutide and similar GLP-1 drugs should be used. If its heart benefits are largely independent of weight loss, then it wouldn’t be helpful to limit the prescribing of these drugs based solely on BMI. People taking semaglutide who lose enough weight to no longer qualify as obese might still benefit from continuing the drug for its heart-protective effects—just as those who don’t lose much weight may, too.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It’s even possible that GLP-1 therapy could one day be reframed as a standalone treatment for heart disease, regardless of BMI. Richard Kovacs, the interim chief of cardiovascular medicine at Indiana University’s School of Medicine, who is not involved with the study, notes that these findings could shape future guidelines in how doctors manage cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This is a potential guideline changer because of its robust effect here. This is a well-run, large trial that we’re all familiar with. It’s an important analysis of it,” Kovacs, who is also the chief medical officer for the American College of Cardiology, told Gizmodo. At the same time, he adds, it would probably still take more data from at least one other large randomized trial for such a change to happen easily.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;One important question left to answer is exactly how these drugs can improve our heart health. The researchers argue that some of the drug’s protection likely stems from its anti-inflammatory effects, both on excess body fat and elsewhere. But the drug’s influence on blood sugar control or our blood vessels could also be playing a part.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet another question is whether these heart-bolstering effects can be seen in people who aren’t overweight or obese—something that Kovacs suspects will be put to the test soon enough. And it’s still important to study whether similar benefits are apparent with other GLP-1 medications, including newer drugs that are combining GLP-1s with other compounds.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For now, this research is continuing to demonstrate that there’s still so much left to learn about these already game-changing drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“I don’t think we know everything that the GLP-1 agonists do yet,” Weintraub said. “So doctors will need to look at this beyond the prism of a TikTok video, where kids are looking to lose a couple of pounds to look better. That may certainly happen, but I think the cosmetic issues and the role of weight loss are just a small part of it.

                                        &lt;p&gt;Shakea Roper didn’t imagine she would become a leader in her neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I really am more of, like, an introvert,” the 41-year-old social worker says. “I wave to my neighbors if they wave, I might have a little chit-chat, but that's the extent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, Roper has created a weekly walking group in one of Kansas City’s historically disadvantaged neighborhoods that encourages a healthy lifestyle and builds community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have to start at home,” she says. “Now that I've done it and got a taste of it, I think it's awesome!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unanticipated role resulted from years of trial, error and neglect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I got diagnosed with congestive heart failure in 2019, and I still wasn't taking it as seriously as I should,” admits Roper, who offers mental health services at her practice, &lt;a href="https://clearedheadspace.com/" class="Link" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cleared Headspace&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But repeat hospital visits, a family history of heart problems, and worried health care professionals put her choices in stark terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Around 2022, my doctor told me if I don't start exercising and eating right, things like that, that I might not have more than five years to live,” she says. “I remember one summer, I think it was three times I had to get admitted to the hospital.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this played out in front of Roper’s children, too — Phoenyx is now 11 years old, and Keayani is 24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roper turned to walking “because I can’t run yet, for one,” she says. “You have to walk before you run.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it wasn’t as simple as stepping out her front door and doing laps around the block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I live in the Marlborough neighborhood, and that leads to some concerns about safety,” Roper says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are times when you see sirens going, there are times you hear arguments. … There's been times where there's, like, standoffs between the police,” she says. “I did not feel safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=""&gt;&lt;b&gt;Making a connection in Marlborough&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seeds of an organized walking group were planted last fall, after Roper signed her business up for a booth at the Marlborough Health and Wellness Fair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just before the fair, Roper met the executive director of the Marlborough Community Coalition, Diane Herschberger, and took the opportunity to mention wanting to find someone to walk with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I made sure to follow up with Diane,” Roper says, “and then she introduced me to Sarah, who’s been wonderful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah Sommerkamp, Marlborough Community Coalition’s contracted program manager, was already a prolific walker in the neighborhood thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/your-voice/residents-in-south-kansas-citys-marlborough-neighborhood-work-to-reduce-violence-by-listening-to-others#:~:text=Residents%20in%20south%20Kansas%20City's,frequency%20of%20violent%20crimes%20happen.%22" class="Link" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a previous door-knocking campaign&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; aimed at reducing crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Diane was like, ‘There's this person who's interested in starting a walking group,’” Sommerkamp remembers learning after the fair. “And I was like, ‘Oh, that's cool!’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, the group has grown slowly but steadily. A grant through the Marlborough Community Coalition provided a small budget for gifts and prizes, and T-shirts with the group’s name on them: “Marlborough Unstoppables.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group started with 30-minute walks around the track at Center Elementary School, at 85th Street and Brooklyn Avenue, on &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=1118206760333298&amp;amp;set=a.457848636369117" class="Link" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Wednesdays and Fridays at 5:30 p.m., and Saturdays at 9 a.m.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; They have recently added Monday and Tuesday walks at 10:30 a.m. on the Harry Wiggins Trolley Track Trail. Roper estimates five to eight people show up consistently, and they have 12 to 15 members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The group is growing because of what is being offered, like friendship, community, we're doing something that's good for your health,” Sommerkamp says. “The raffles and the T-shirts, those are just fun. But it's really about the people.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roper’s 11-year-old daughter often spends sessions zooming around the concrete track on a scooter. Last month, the 24-year-old stuck to a table and bench with a book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fact that my daughter enjoys going on these walks and also joining in and being social and encouraging and being able to help keep people accountable — it's good for her health, but I also think it's good for her character development,” Roper says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors agree small changes can make a difference in people’s health. According to the Mayo Clinic, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/walking/art-20046261" class="Link" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a daily brisk walk can help&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintain a healthy weight, prevent and manage heart disease and type 2 diabetes, improve cardiovascular fitness, and strengthen bones and muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=""&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘I’m not at the highest level!’&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep the group inclusive, Roper takes care to make sure any other routes are appropriate for all skill levels. And during summer’s dog days, the group walked in Ward Parkway Shopping Center to avoid the heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are places that you can sit down, so if you go around and you need a break, no one's going to bite your head off,” Roper says. “No one's going to judge you if you're not at the highest level — I’m not at the highest level!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, members of the group walked in a 2.5-mile neighborhood fun run/walk organized by Sommerkamp, and some are taking part in a fall scavenger hunt that explores green spaces in Marlborough and beyond until Nov. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At some point we want to start walking the actual neighborhood,” Roper says. “I think that it’s going to help with the safety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42949-020-00005-7" class="Link" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;A 2021 study from the city-focused online journal npj Urban Sustainability&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found a 5% increase in street activity in Chicago was associated with 9% less violent crime, and a 5% increase in street activity in New York City was associated with 2.7% less violent crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People are less likely to do crime in front of other people — they don't want to get caught,” Roper says. Plus, “the more presence that we have, the more people will be able to see it outside their window, even if they haven't seen a flier.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

I have asthma; I didn't have to take my inhaler.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Enh" data-align-center&gt;

Along with an unfriendly clime, these winter months can usher in some unwelcome feelings in the guise of the “winter blues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the winter blues, and how can you get your energy back if all you want to do is bundle up and hibernate the season away? We spoke with several experts to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The winter blues are fairly common, Amy Sedgwick, director of clinical operations at &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/MountainsideTreatment/"&gt;Mountainside, a rehabilitation center&lt;/a&gt;, explains. She explains that the winter blues are usually amplified feelings of stress and/or sadness that many experience around the holiday season, typically starting when daylight saving time ends in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Less sunlight, shorter days, and the pressure to remain upbeat during the holiday season can cause people to feel withdrawn and upset, even if they have never been diagnosed with depression,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that the winter blues, or feeling down or depressed when the days are shorter and the nights are longer, could be a sign of &lt;a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/seasonal-affective-disorder" rel="nofollow"&gt;seasonal affective disorder&lt;/a&gt;. This is a specific type of depression that is only present during certain parts of the year, and wintertime is the most common season for it to crop up. If you are feeling exceptionally sad and/or hopeless, it may be time to see a doctor or mental health professional. But for your average cases of winter blues, these tips from experts should help get you out of your funk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lack of energy often accompanies a general feeling of being down in the dumps. How can you get a little pep back in your step if you just want to cover yourself in blankets and binge Netflix?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;People who don’t feel like hibernating slugs every winter swear by these 7 energy habits:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Exercise&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2025-10/people-dont-feel-like-hibernating-slugs-every-winter-have-these-habits-exercise.png" alt="woman who exercises so she doesn't feel like a hibernating slug every winter" title="people who don't feel like hibernating slugs every winter swear by these energy habits exercise" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;PeopleImages / Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sedgwick says &lt;a href="https://www.yourtango.com/health-wellness/tibetan-exercises-daily-stay-young-forever"&gt;exercise is your best bet&lt;/a&gt; for blasting the blues away and improving your energy stores. “Physical movement releases endorphins and has a mood-boosting effect,” she says. “Going ice-skating, participating in winter sports with friends, or committing to a gym routine can provide a self-esteem boost and encourage people who are feeling sad or isolated during the winter months to become more active and motivated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other than the physiological benefits, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9914638/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;research shows that&lt;/a&gt; exercise can provide a mental break from negative thoughts and worries, acting as a form of active meditation. Beyond accomplishment, exercise is linked to an overall improvement in self-esteem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/if-you-usually-get-depressed-during-winter-these-simple-habits-will-make-you-less-sad"&gt;If You Usually Get Depressed During The Winter, These 5 Simple Habits Will Make You Less Sad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2.

He suggests opening your shades or curtains ASAP in the morning and sitting by a window as often as you can, especially if you work at a sedentary job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunlight exposure helps regulate the body's internal clock and suppresses the production of melatonin, &lt;a href="https://newsinhealth.nih.gov/2013/01/beat-winter-blues" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;one study explained&lt;/a&gt;.

Nearly 38% of adults are now estimated to have Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), based on a systematic review published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.journal-of-hepatology.eu/article/S0168-8278(23)00324-0/fulltext" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Journal of Hepatology.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty liver diagnosis, as most of us think, is simply the accumulation of fat in the liver, but to our surprise, it is more than simple fat buildup. Dr. Robert DeBease, a functional medicine expert, says that it's more complicated than that. In his opinion, a fatty liver issue is more of a matter of what's going on with the nutrients within your body, and specifically points to copper, vitamin A, and even the sugar in fruit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Fatty liver diet: Best and worst foods for your liver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fat is not the only culprit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, let's reconsider the simple concept of fatty liver. Dr. DeBease explains that having this condition isn't so much about fat. Rather, "hidden triggers," and these are copper, vitamin A, and fruit sugar (fructose). The liver, is the toxin filtering organ, and its key responsibility is to keep the iron out of the liver and into the blood, thereby keeping the body in motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where it gets confusing. If you don't have adequate copper or vitamin A, that iron becomes held back in the liver. Visualize the iron as a truckload that can't depart the warehouse. This inventory begins to destroy liver cells and makes fat start to accumulate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, in supporting your liver, it's not merely about consuming less fat—it's about aiding this iron-shuttling process to function properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;This is where fructose comes into play&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, there's sugar found in fruits, known as fructose. One might think fruits are healthy all the time, but Dr. DeBease shares a cautionary note for those with fatty liver.He advises eliminating fruit totally from the regimen and the reason being is that fructose is primary is metabolised by the liver and that metabolism uses a ton of energy. If we consume excess fructose, the liver becomes overloaded and begins to "burn out." The liver cells are damaged over time, particularly if copper and vitamin A levels are already low in the body. This creates a persistent problem, perpetuating the cycle of fatty liver disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. DeBease recommends not only reducing carbs overall, but avoiding sugars from fruit particularly. For a person with fatty liver, fruit doesn't appear as harmless as it does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's one more level here. Copper and vitamin A collaborate inside the body in much the same way that our actions and mind does. They assist in transferring iron from the liver to the blood. If there's not enough of these nutrients, that entire system collapses. Iron becomes stuck, and as a consequence, liver cells are injured and fat starts accumulating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To overcome this, Dr. DeBease suggests consuming foods that are high in copper and vitamin A. Carrots, sweet potato, kale, eggs, and pumpkin, he calls it nature's best food sources!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can we do differently to avoid this disease&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. DeBease's action plan for patients with fatty liver is quite articulate, and it consists of four key steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliminate all fruits from your diet, not just high-sugar ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduce the overall consumption of carbohydrates.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shed light on quality proteins and good fats.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Include nutrient-dense organ meats such as liver in your weekly diet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;He believes these changes help reduce the iron backlog in the liver, replace nutrients you’re missing, and give your liver a way to repair itself and clear out the excess fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Connections to stress hormones&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's also interesting is how he relates liver function to the adrenal glands, which are a major player in managing stress. If the liver is not in good health, it will overload your adrenal glands because the liver turns cortisol on and off, which is the hormone that assists you in coping with stress. When the adrenal system of the body becomes overburdened from compromised liver function, one can experience even more issues in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To tie this all together, in the end, Dr. Robert DeBease's theory makes us look at fatty liver disease differently. It's not merely about the visible fat, but also about underlying nutritional imbalances and metabolic stressors. He makes individuals pull out fruit, consume fewer carbs, opt for nutrient-dense animal proteins, and replenish copper and vitamin A with whole foods. His approach is more about providing the body with what it requires in order to eliminate iron, facilitate repairs naturally, and restore balance to the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if one is dealing with fatty liver, now is the time to look far beyond from standard diet and health tips, instead support the body from the inside out, ensure that it has all the right nutrients in appropriate amounts. Avoiding the culprits for far too long can silently damage the liver and the body alike, see the bigger picture here, according to Dr. DeBease, a healthier and a more resilient liver and a stronger and balanced body overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Disclaimer: This is for informational purposes only.

So when levels of these important hormones are reduced, there is more inflammation in our muscles and joints leading to worsening pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some women can experience hip pain due to osteoarthritis, which is more common in menopausal women..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is also something called greater trochanteric pain syndrome (sometimes called trochanteric bursitis), which is a painful condition affecting the outer disc of the hip and thigh. This is often triggered by low hormone levels.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, how we experience pain can also be affected by hormonal changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-KxTGFn4ikg7SpPgYbLESU7" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-KxTGFn4ikg7SpPgYbLESU7 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Another thing that can happen is that the hormones progesterone, estradiol and testosterone can affect our pain receptors. This basically means that when levels of these hormones are low, our perception of pain changes, and we can feel it more than usual.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spoke to Newson in more detail about these symptoms and what can help reduce them. We know exercise is essential so I also asked pelvic floor therapist &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thepelvicinstitute.com/meet-the-team" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.thepelvicinstitute.com/meet-the-team" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Dr Amanda Neri&lt;/a&gt; to create a hip mobility workout, featured below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;section class="article__schema-question" id="99a72309-50e2-40b3-9c43-a09dc0721224"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How does perimenopause and menopause affect women and what can they do about it?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;article class="article__schema-answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The changes women experience during peri- and menopause are directly due to low hormone levels,” says Newson. “In my opinion, the best way to treat the symptoms is using HRT that is the same structure as natural hormones—called body-identical—rather than synthetic ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These are progesterone and estradiol and are made from plant sources like soy. They are not associated with risks, which the synthetic hormones are, and they are available on the NHS—the UK’s publicly funded healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These hormones will reduce inflammation and change the way pain is perceived—in beneficial ways. Once these hormones are replaced, then women often have more energy and motivation, as well as less muscle and joint pains so then they can exercise more.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section class="article__schema-question" id="7e00e97a-4e73-4b2d-abaf-9dfd77812017"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Can diet and exercise improve menopause-related hip pain?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;article class="article__schema-answer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Regular exercise can reduce inflammation in our bodies as well as improve blood flow and reduce pain,” says Newson. “Reducing or cutting out inflammatory, processed food can also be really beneficial at improving pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means cutting back on things like sugary foods, sodas, fried food, pastries, alcohol and refined carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Movement can really help with menopause-related hip issues but it’s important not to push yourself in ways that increase or worsen pain,” says Newson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many women find that they need to stretch more before exercising or change the type of exercise they do. Some women prefer Pilates or yoga rather than high-intensity classes. Everyone is different though so it is important to find an exercise that you enjoy and can do regularly,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your peri- or menopause symptoms are affecting your ability to exercise, Newson recommends seeking advice from a healthcare professional who understands hormones, especially testosterone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Research has shown that 73% of women who were prescribed testosterone found that it helped them to increase their physical activity. Testosterone can also work to improve mood, motivation, energy and stamina.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;a id="elk-five-movements-to-help-manage-stiff-hips" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-five-movements-to-help-manage-stiff-hips"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Five movements to help manage stiff hips&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="5730ab71-d1c3-40df-a98e-36d3fe79ba7b"&gt;For movement to help manage menopausal hip pain, pelvic floor therapist Dr Amanda Neri has created this routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="7932c68c-672a-435b-88db-fab8d59f5ec8"&gt;You will need a mini or loop resistance band (like this &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=110083&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FFit-Simplify-Resistance-Exercise-Instruction%2Fdp%2FB01AVDVHTI%2Fref%3Dsxin_16_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa%3Fcontent-id%3Damzn1.sym.a1bc2dac-8d07-44d1-9477-59bc11451909%253Aamzn1.sym.a1bc2dac-8d07-44d1-9477-59bc11451909%26crid%3D270E6G0GYNTO1%26cv_ct_cx%3Dloop%2Bresistance%2Bbands%26keywords%3Dloop%2Bresistance%2Bbands%26pd_rd_i%3DB01AVDVHTI%26pd_rd_r%3D5ae08136-f2fd-4cb9-b46e-49f9d6efad0f%26pd_rd_w%3DHzzj0%26pd_rd_wg%3DErYBR%26pf_rd_p%3Da1bc2dac-8d07-44d1-9477-59bc11451909%26pf_rd_r%3DJCWK3K3K5JR64TE2959D%26qid%3D1760953562%26sbo%3DRZvfv%252F%252FHxDF%252BO5021pAnSA%253D%253D%26sprefix%3Dloop%2Bresistance%2B%252Caps%252C220%26sr%3D1-1-9428117c-b940-4daa-97e9-ad363ada7940-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9zZWFyY2hfdGhlbWF0aWM%26psc%3D1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dfitandwell-gb-1167674368504617640-20" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.amazon.com/Fit-Simplify-Resistance-Exercise-Instruction/dp/B01AVDVHTI/ref=sxin_16_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa?content-id=amzn1.sym.a1bc2dac-8d07-44d1-9477-59bc11451909%3Aamzn1.sym.a1bc2dac-8d07-44d1-9477-59bc11451909&amp;amp;crid=270E6G0GYNTO1&amp;amp;cv_ct_cx=loop+resistance+bands&amp;amp;keywords=loop+resistance+bands&amp;amp;pd_rd_i=B01AVDVHTI&amp;amp;pd_rd_r=5ae08136-f2fd-4cb9-b46e-49f9d6efad0f&amp;amp;pd_rd_w=Hzzj0&amp;amp;pd_rd_wg=ErYBR&amp;amp;pf_rd_p=a1bc2dac-8d07-44d1-9477-59bc11451909&amp;amp;pf_rd_r=JCWK3K3K5JR64TE2959D&amp;amp;qid=1760953562&amp;amp;sbo=RZvfv%2F%2FHxDF%2BO5021pAnSA%3D%3D&amp;amp;sprefix=loop+resistance+%2Caps%2C220&amp;amp;sr=1-1-9428117c-b940-4daa-97e9-ad363ada7940-spons&amp;amp;sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9zZWFyY2hfdGhlbWF0aWM&amp;amp;psc=1" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="hawklinks" data-placeholder-url="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=110083&amp;amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FFit-Simplify-Resistance-Exercise-Instruction%2Fdp%2FB01AVDVHTI%2Fref%3Dsxin_16_pa_sp_search_thematic_sspa%3Fcontent-id%3Damzn1.sym.a1bc2dac-8d07-44d1-9477-59bc11451909%253Aamzn1.sym.a1bc2dac-8d07-44d1-9477-59bc11451909%26crid%3D270E6G0GYNTO1%26cv_ct_cx%3Dloop%2Bresistance%2Bbands%26keywords%3Dloop%2Bresistance%2Bbands%26pd_rd_i%3DB01AVDVHTI%26pd_rd_r%3D5ae08136-f2fd-4cb9-b46e-49f9d6efad0f%26pd_rd_w%3DHzzj0%26pd_rd_wg%3DErYBR%26pf_rd_p%3Da1bc2dac-8d07-44d1-9477-59bc11451909%26pf_rd_r%3DJCWK3K3K5JR64TE2959D%26qid%3D1760953562%26sbo%3DRZvfv%252F%252FHxDF%252BO5021pAnSA%253D%253D%26sprefix%3Dloop%2Bresistance%2B%252Caps%252C220%26sr%3D1-1-9428117c-b940-4daa-97e9-ad363ada7940-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9zZWFyY2hfdGhlbWF0aWM%26psc%3D1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-custom-tracking-20" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="Amazon US" data-merchant-id="1471" data-merchant-network="Amazonus" data-merchant-url="amazon.com"&gt;set on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;) for this sequence.

                                    &lt;span class="half-and-half__title h5"&gt;New cancer therapy ‘a major step forward’&lt;/span&gt;
                
                                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A pioneering procedure that deploys ultrasound to destroy tumours is “a major and exciting step forward in cancer treatment”, doctors said this week.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Histotripsy uses sound waves to create microscopic bubbles from gases present in tumour tissues. The bubbles form and collapse in microseconds, destroying cancer cells without the need for surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. With treatment taking as little as 30 minutes, patients can recover quickly and spend less time in hospital.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Roger Jackson, 80, is the first patient in Europe to receive the treatment for his liver cancer. “I feel privileged,” he said. “It’s impressive to think that sound waves can treat cancer, without the need for patients like me to go through intensive surgery, at what already is a stressful time.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jackson (pictured) was treated at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, England, which is currently the only hospital in the country offering the therapy.     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Histotripsy represents a hugely exciting and new era of cancer innovation and care,” said the hospital’s chief exec Roland Sinker. “With faster recovery times … this not only reduces the strain on our hospital beds, but also frees up surgeons to focus on the more complex cancer cases.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Studies are underway to explore histotripsy’s effectiveness on other cancer types. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

While common symptoms include abdominal pain, jaundice, and unexplained weight loss, recent research shows that certain leg symptoms may appear first. Patients may experience pain, swelling, redness, or warmth in the legs, which can serve as early warning signs of pancreatic cancer. Recognising these subtle indicators is vital for timely diagnosis and treatment, potentially improving survival rates. With pancreatic cancer causing over a million deaths globally each year, awareness of both traditional and early leg symptoms is crucial for prevention and early intervention. This aggressive cancer often spreads quickly to nearby organs and is frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage, making early detection and awareness even more essential. Take a look...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Pancreatic cancer From signs to treatment process, expert explains how to manage the condition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leg pain, swelling, redness: Spotting common symptoms of pancreatic cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;1. Pain in the legs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persistent or unexplained pain in the legs can be a subtle yet significant warning sign. This discomfort may arise from deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a condition where a blood clot forms in a deep vein, often in the legs. According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/pancreatic-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/signs-and-symptoms.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in the context of pancreatic cancer, DVT can occur due to the body's altered clotting mechanisms, which are influenced by the presence of cancerous cells &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;2. Swelling in the legs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unexplained swelling in one or both legs, especially if it develops suddenly, can indicate the presence of a blood clot or other circulatory issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In pancreatic cancer patients, such swelling may be linked to DVT or the compression of blood vessels by tumour growth, leading to impaired blood flow. Persistent swelling accompanied by pain, redness, or warmth should be evaluated promptly, as early detection can prevent serious complications and improve treatment outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;3. Redness in the legs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redness or a reddish hue in the skin of the legs can be a sign of inflammation or infection. In the case of DVT associated with pancreatic cancer, the affected area may appear red due to increased blood flow as the body attempts to combat the clot. This discolouration is often accompanied by warmth, tenderness, and mild swelling, indicating underlying circulatory issues that require immediate medical evaluation to prevent potentially life-threatening complications such as pulmonary embolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;4. Warmth in the legs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sensation of warmth in the legs, particularly around the swollen or painful areas, can indicate inflammation. This warmth is often a response to the body's immune system reacting to the clot or tumour. In pancreatic cancer, such symptoms may be among the first to manifest, preceding more typical signs like jaundice or abdominal pain. Persistent warmth accompanied by redness, tenderness, or swelling should not be ignored, as it may signal deep vein thrombosis or tumour-related vascular complications requiring prompt medical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;See More: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/cancer-breakthrough-scientists-discover-protein-that-could-stop-tumour-growth-in-the-pancreas/articleshow/124158628.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Cancer breakthrough: Scientists discover protein that could stop tumour growth in the pancreas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why do these symptoms matter&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presence of these leg symptoms, especially when they occur without an obvious cause, should not be dismissed.

There are not enough specialists, beds or treatment options, she believes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Children and adolescents with OCD across England can receive treatment at a national centre at the Maudsley Hospital in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;However, the average wait time for a referral to the service rose from 15 weeks in 2020, to 41 weeks in 2024, according to a response to the BBC's Freedom of Information Act request. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;But the hospital trust says that wait time is being cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Ade Odunlade, chief operating officer for South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust said: "We have worked incredibly hard to reduce delays and have lowered the average wait for assessments to around 20 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"We empathise with anyone who has had to wait for their assessment as we know how difficult that is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The trust says it has now been able to secure additional funding which will allow them to employ further staff and drive down the waiting list even further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;It expects an approximate wait for assessment of about 12-16 weeks by early Spring 2026, it told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 gXrNRM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-5340b511-1 cMIbKV"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251021-134202-667692b2c6-web-2.32.2-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-5340b511-0 gUePlo hide-when-no-script" aria-label="image unavailable"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/87c3/live/b7696630-ae75-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/87c3/live/b7696630-ae75-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/87c3/live/b7696630-ae75-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/87c3/live/b7696630-ae75-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/87c3/live/b7696630-ae75-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/87c3/live/b7696630-ae75-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/87c3/live/b7696630-ae75-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/87c3/live/b7696630-ae75-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Marie Fuller A woman with short dark brown hair, wearing black sunglasses and a black and white checked shirt is hugging a young girl, also with shoulder-length brown hair.

&lt;p id="b54d8892-8894-4516-bdc9-c94268d719dc"&gt;Like most desk workers, I deal with a stiff lower back. The truth is, sitting down all day isn’t good for us because it restricts muscles and joints, particularly around the hips and lower back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why I’m always looking for stretches that will relieve tension in that area. Fortunately, my favorite yoga instructor Adriene Mishler—better known to her 13 million &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; subscribers as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/tag/yoga-with-adriene" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/tag/yoga-with-adriene"&gt;Yoga With Adriene&lt;/a&gt;—recently shared a routine dedicated to mobilising the lower back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="b54d8892-8894-4516-bdc9-c94268d719dc-2"&gt;It’s just 10 minutes long and it doesn’t require any equipment, so I was keen to give it a go as a much-needed break from my working day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what happened when I tried it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-to-do-yoga-with-adriene-s-10-minute-lower-back-mobility-routine" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-yoga-with-adriene-s-10-minute-lower-back-mobility-routine"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do Yoga With Adriene’s 10-minute lower-back mobility routine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="16fbca9f-3276-466a-87ce-a47b6a0bd852"&gt;You don’t need any equipment to do this routine, although you might want to roll out your yoga mat, or at least a folded towel, to cushion your knees, because you kneel for some of the poses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-my-experience-trying-yoga-with-adriene-s-lower-back-mobility-routine" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-experience-trying-yoga-with-adriene-s-lower-back-mobility-routine"&gt;&lt;span&gt;My experience trying Yoga With Adriene’s lower-back mobility routine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="6464552e-19ce-4b33-8497-0aa3415ea63c"&gt;I feel like I’ve tried every stretch under the sun, but there were a couple of movements in this routine that I hadn’t come across before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One involved bringing my knees to my chest and then pushing them away from the body, which activated my pelvic floor muscles and stretched my lower back. The other was pelvic tilts, which felt so good in my lower back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-hnqDtVAMxmuELfFheZEADf" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-hnqDtVAMxmuELfFheZEADf slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These exercises not only stretched my lower back, but also activated the muscles surrounding it, which should help to reduce stiffness in the long term, so I’ll definitely come back to these moves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest of the video took the same approach to a series of exercises, performing them dynamically first—moving in and out of position—and then passively, holding the stretch for a few breaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moves include supine twists, extended child’s pose and cat-cow, all of which felt great for my stiff back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, this was a satisfying routine for someone like me with an achy lower back and my entire body felt less stiff after doing it. I’d recommend it for anyone who needs a short break from a sedentary routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="2b349082-5d31-4c67-9fcd-82e9461157ab"&gt;It’s been a hit in the comments too, and a few people have said it reminds them of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-05m7bboK0" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-05m7bboK0" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;lower back love video&lt;/a&gt; Mishler published in 2014.
