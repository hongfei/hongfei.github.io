  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="105" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmaq5nmkc002d3b751duddgsz@published"&gt;My boyfriend and I are at odds because he has grown out his beard and I refuse to have sex with him again until he gets rid of it. I think beards are gross—they are dirt magnets and I can’t stand the feel of them. I was at a sex party once and ended an encounter with a guy who was eating me out because the feel of his beard against my pussy was awful. My boyfriend says it’s his body, so it should be up to him. As far as I’m concerned, not if it causes me physical displeasure. That should give me the final say, right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmaq5nmkc002g3b758eko15yu@published"&gt;In a sense you have the final say because you get to say no to sex for whatever reason. Your body, your choice. But the same principle applies to your boyfriend. If he wants a beard, he gets to have a beard. You have a good reason for wanting him to get rid of it: You find it uncomfortable during oral sex. But he has a good reason for wanting to keep it: He likes it. In the case of such a draw, it’s the body owner’s choice. The beard stays if he wants it to.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmaq5nmkc002h3b751fyxb6ig@published"&gt;Now, your decision to refrain from sex may eventually win him to your side. One might call this manipulation, and maybe it is in some sense, but again, you have a valid reason for not wanting your bush to come in contact with his. Could you do stuff sexually anyway that &lt;em&gt;doesn’t &lt;/em&gt;involve beard-on-skin contact? Sure, but if things like kissing and oral are essential to your sex life, I can understand how that kind of activity would be much less attractive in light of his facial hair.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="183" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmaq5nmkc002i3b75f6zhv3ci@published"&gt;The problem with this kind of bargaining is that it might not be bargaining at all. It may lead to a stalemate. And then what? If you both hold out, neither of you win, per se, because you’re cutting off a presumably important part of your relationship. There can only be losers here. Maybe you wear him down and he relents and you’re happy and at least he’s getting laid. Maybe you never have sex again and decide to break up. I would encourage some kind of compromise here—perhaps you can find a length of beard that is beardy enough to satisfy his aesthetic purposes but not so beardy that it feels terrible against your vulva. Maybe he settles for a mustache or resolves to be the first guy in history to make a soul patch look cool. You should be willing to give at least a little here, as generosity is a good force to bring to the coupling and finding a mutually satisfying path forward is what you do in relationships. If you can’t, his beard may be an irreconcilable difference.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="137" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmaq5k6pa001z3b75tpg5bdel@published"&gt;There are a few subcategories of premature ejaculation. There’s lifelong PE and then there’s &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/premature-ejaculation/symptoms-causes/syc-20354900"&gt;acquired PE&lt;/a&gt;—the latter is seen in people who previously had no sexual problems of this nature, like your husband. PE can have &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15627-premature-ejaculation"&gt;psychological roots&lt;/a&gt;—things like stress and anxiety can contribute, so if your husband has any new stressors or changes in his life, that may explain it. As the sexuality counselor Ian Kerner put it when I emailed him for &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/10/bi-boyfriend-piv-problem-advice.html"&gt;a past column&lt;/a&gt; about this issue, regarding acquired PE: “In almost all cases, the cause is performance anxiety which is governed by our sympathetic nervous system that mediates fight or flight response.” In other words, worrying about coming too fast can sometimes make it worse. And feeling guilty or ashamed about it can cause some people to rush through sex, exacerbating the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="53" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmaq5k6pa00203b754d8eikcu@published"&gt;Keep in mind that PE can also indicate physical issues like a hormonal problem or enlarged prostate. When someone sees a shift in sexual functioning—especially one this severe—it’s best to go see a doctor to make sure there isn’t an underlying health issue. Get your husband to the urologist as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

And then there is the stop-start method, which, much as it sounds, involves him penetrating for as long as he can without getting to the point of no return. As he approaches, he pulls out, takes a breather, and then continues. He repeats this as many times as possible. If those methods don’t work, sometimes a low dose of an SSRI is prescribed (since that class of drugs can delay ejaculation). A numbing spray may help, as may wearing a condom, though neither address the root cause of acquired PE, and might diminish his sensation in unenjoyable ways. Try any or all of these, and see &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/10/bi-boyfriend-piv-problem-advice.html"&gt;this past column&lt;/a&gt; for more in-depth advice on treating this condition.&lt;/p&gt;

Right now you simply don’t know. Attempt to collect more information. Don’t badger her with requests. Instead, bring up how much you miss her head—they were the best you’ve ever had, which might feel good for her to know—and how much of an important feature of your sex life to you that it was. Why is she no longer into it, and is there anything you can do to help her get into it again? Perhaps it’s something you’ve been doing that turns her off—maybe she doesn’t like the way that you talk to her while she’s sucking you off, or maybe you’ve held her head in such a way that makes her uncomfortable. Maybe it’s not you at all but some kind of other external influence or inner voice.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="104" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmaq5k6pb00273b75ic9v9cl2@published"&gt;If she becomes uncomfortable during these conversations, back off for a little while and return again in a few weeks/months. Underscore the importance of blowjobs (though keep the drama out of the equation and avoid exaggerating terms like “heartsick” to describe your relationship to her head). You should also assess whether this indicates larger issues around sex or communication. Is your sex life otherwise perfect? Is she fully satisfied? Understand that things like this exist in context and your self-awareness may not be sharp as you think it is. You can always discuss joint sex counseling if you can’t get any clarity from her.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="126" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmaq5k6pb00283b75aoookn62@published"&gt;The fact is it’s your wife’s right to say no to anything. It’s her right to change her mind. You are not entitled to the blowjobs that she once gave you. You never were. I don’t think this is a matter of “convincing” her to give you head, I think this is an opportunity to seek more information and bolster your communication. Once things are clearer, you still must take no for an answer, but at the very least maybe your wife could help you come up with a satisfying alternative path to your own satisfaction. Does she really think that you should live the rest of your life without blowjobs? The answer to that may be illuminating and help you figure out potential next steps.&lt;/p&gt;

In a rat model mimicking human exercise, scientists found that dopamine and noradrenaline levels increased in the hippocampus during low-intensity activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These neurotransmitters were traced back to specific brainstem regions, the ventral tegmental area and locus coeruleus, which also showed activation.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin, collectively known as monoamines, are critical neurotransmitters that regulate neuronal activity and plasticity and are produced by neurons that cluster in the brainstem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The monoamines transmitted to the hippocampus promote neuronal and synaptic plasticity, contributing to the regulation of memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, this research team hypothesized that the monoaminergic system originating in the brainstem may contribute to hippocampal activation during light exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this hypothesis, this study established a rat treadmill running model that mimicked the physiological responses in human exercise to evaluate the effects of exercise at different intensities on hippocampal monoamine concentrations and the activation of brainstem monoaminergic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopamine and noradrenaline levels increased in the hippocampus, even with light exercise. Furthermore, in the brainstem, the dopamine-producing neurons in the ventral tegmental area and noradrenaline-producing neurons in the locus coeruleus, both of which could be the origins of these neurotransmitters, were also activated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the activation of these two regions were positively correlated with hippocampal neuronal activation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study findings indicate that dopamine originating from the ventral tegmental area and noradrenaline originating from the locus coeruleus may significantly influence the neural circuits that activate the hippocampus during light exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further research is required to clarify the neural circuit mechanisms of memory enhancement activated by light exercise and support the effectiveness of exercise prescriptions on enhancing memory and brain plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This research was supported in part by KAKENHI Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (A) (18H04081; 21H04858; 24H00670) (to H.S.); KAKENHI Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Innovative Areas: Next Generation Exercise Program for Developing Motivation, Body and Mind Performance (16H06405) (to H.S.); Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST)-Mirai Program (JPMJMI19D5) (to H.S.); Grant-in-Aid for Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Fellowships (20J20887) (to T.H.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this exercise and neuroplasticity research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://soyalab.taiiku.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/index_en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SOYA Hideaki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tsukuba.ac.jp/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Tsukuba&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;SOYA Hideaki – University of Tsukuba&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202400418RRR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Light-exercise-induced dopaminergic and noradrenergic stimulation in the dorsal hippocampus: Using a rat physiological exercise model&lt;/a&gt;” by SOYA Hideaki et al. &lt;em&gt;FASEB Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light-exercise-induced dopaminergic and noradrenergic stimulation in the dorsal hippocampus: Using a rat physiological exercise model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exercise activates the dorsal hippocampus that triggers synaptic and cellar plasticity and ultimately promotes memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, these benefits have been explored using demanding and stress-response-inducing exercise at moderate-to-vigorous intensities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, our translational research with animals and humans has focused on light-intensity exercise (light exercise) below the lactate threshold (LT), which almost anyone can safely perform with minimal stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that even light exercise can stimulate hippocampal activity and enhance memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the circuit mechanism of this boost remains unclear, arousal promotion even with light exercise implies the involvement of the ascending monoaminergic system that is essential to modulate hippocampal activity and impact memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this hypothesis, we employed our physiological exercise model based on the LT of rats and immunohistochemically assessed the neuronal activation of the dorsal hippocampal sub-regions and brainstem monoaminergic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, we monitored the extracellular concentration of monoamines in the dorsal hippocampus using in vivo microdialysis. We found that even light exercise increased neuronal activity in the dorsal hippocampal sub-regions and elevated the extracellular concentrations of noradrenaline and dopamine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, we found that tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) were activated even by light exercise and were both positively correlated with the dorsal hippocampal activation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that light exercise stimulates dorsal hippocampal neurons, which are associated with LC-noradrenergic and VTA-dopaminergic activation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sheds light on the circuit mechanisms responsible for hippocampal neural activation during exercise, consequently enhancing memory function.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 18 May 2025 14:32:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBNMnAzNlAxYjF6TUdURDE5MjRYcW5IbmFhLXI1TFJmVzR6TG1MaDl2TUhvMmFyNkM2R0t0OVpkNnItX0kzMVRIUG1lQ3M0MFRZdkhaQUFNQ1hfRjVhdDlMY2FrVzJDTzFPakQwS1RmR1VIUTZz0gF6QVVfeXFMTm1Ud0ppWjk2X3VuS21jeEFwc1BhQ3Nld0xPbWxKQS1LOGJFc3BxTC03Q3VOa29DX3hETlZBU3NiS29taDU4RERKZUxpbFphZEk3NXR6TG45TkNrZHZrSm9LRW1JN0hDbUNxdjNNX2ZDcHdUSko5c1pHVUE</guid></item><item><title>长时间坐着可能会缩小大脑-神经科学新闻 | Sitting for Hours May Shrink the Brain - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE5JNzRpb2JjN0RqZ3VCVFJVZjhBQ1c1YmxCNzloODJTZzBvWTk4RWI4VUQzZDdPUzBDVVlydTdxd2p0aF9jQmZvTWtVSmRKWmVha0RZNFRlcHBOS1N4Z3Z3MFE1Wmx0ZEdxM3dudFpVWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Prolonged sedentary behavior in adults over 50 is linked to cognitive decline and brain shrinkage in regions vulnerable to Alzheimer’s disease. Even among those who exercise regularly, spending more time sitting was associated with worse cognitive outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect was strongest in individuals carrying the APOE-e4 gene, a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s. These findings suggest that breaking up sedentary time throughout the day may be a key strategy for protecting brain health and reducing Alzheimer’s risk, especially in genetically vulnerable individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Independent of Exercise:&lt;/strong&gt; More sitting led to cognitive decline even in regular exercisers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic Risk Factor:&lt;/strong&gt; Effects were more pronounced in APOE-e4 carriers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Sedentary behavior was associated with brain shrinkage over 7 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Vanderbilt University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Over 6 million Americans are impacted by Alzheimer’s disease, and researchers from Vanderbilt University Medical Center and the University of Pittsburgh are discovering how lifestyle habits can impact the likelihood of developing the disease. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a new research study published in &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;, researchers found that increased sedentary behavior, time spent sitting or lying down, in aging adults was associated with worse cognition and brain shrinkage in areas related to risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110091"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an older man sitting and brains." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sedentary-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These conclusions were stronger in participants who carried the APOE-e4 allele, a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting that reducing sedentary time may be especially important for older adults who are at increased genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease.

Their sedentary time was then related to their cognitive performance and brain scans captured over a seven-year follow-up period. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants who spent more time sedentary were more likely to experience cognitive decline and neurodegenerative changes regardless of how much they exercised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These conclusions were stronger in participants who carried the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;APOE-e4&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;allele, a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, suggesting that reducing sedentary time may be especially important for older adults who are at increased genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reducing your risk for Alzheimer’s disease is not just about working out once a day,” said Gogniat. “Minimizing the time spent sitting, even if you do exercise daily, reduces the likelihood of developing Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is critical to study lifestyle choices and the impact they have on brain health as we age,” said Jefferson, who holds the Herbert O. and Vineta Christopher Directorship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study showed that reducing sitting time could be a promising strategy for preventing neurodegeneration and subsequent cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research highlights the importance of reducing sitting time, particularly among aging adults at increased genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease. It is critical to our brain health to take breaks from sitting throughout the day and move around to increase our active time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was funded by the Alzheimer’s Association and the National Institute on Aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sedentary behavior and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c3a0b1a2aaa4eda1aca6b1ada6b183b5b6aea0edacb1a4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Craig Boerner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://vumc.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Vanderbilt University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Craig Boerner – Vanderbilt University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70157" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Increased sedentary behavior is associated with neurodegeneration and worse cognition in older adults over a 7-year period despite high levels of physical activity&lt;/a&gt;” by Marissa Gogniat et al. &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased sedentary behavior is associated with neurodegeneration and worse cognition in older adults over a 7-year period despite high levels of physical activity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70157-sec-0010-title"&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sedentary behavior may be a modifiable risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

			&lt;p&gt;New research has shown how the parasitic amoeba &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entamoeba_histolytica"&gt;Entamoeba histolytica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; takes bites from your cells to use as a disguise, hiding them from the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Entering the body via contaminated food or water, most infections from the parasite cause diarrhea, if any symptoms at all. In particularly bad cases, the amoeba can spread via the bloodstream to other vital organs, where it can cause serious problems. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If the infection reaches the liver, for instance, the amoebic abscesses it creates can be fatal, causing complications that claim the lives of almost 70,000 people each year.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;this tiny monster wreaks such havoc in its host was largely unknown, until microbiologist Katherine Ralston – currently at the University of California Davis, but back then posted at the University of Virginia – investigated the amoeba more closely in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The going theory was that &lt;em&gt;E. histolytica &lt;/em&gt;injected a poison into its victim cells. But Ralston &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13242"&gt;saw something very different&lt;/a&gt; going on through her microscope. &lt;em&gt;E. histolytica &lt;/em&gt;was taking what looked like actual bites out of human cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"To devise new therapies or vaccines, you really need to know how &lt;em&gt;E. histolytica&lt;/em&gt; damages tissue," Ralston &lt;a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/wily-parasite-kills-human-cells-and-wears-their-remains-disguise"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;You could see little parts of the human cell being broken off&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stranger still, the amoeba &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.03163-21"&gt;seemed satisfied&lt;/a&gt; with just a few chomps from each cell's membrane before moving on to its next victim, leaving in its wake a slew of half-chewed cells with cytoplasms oozing from their puncture wounds.&lt;/p&gt;

Cysts can survive days to weeks in the external environment and remain infectious in the environment due to the protection conferred by their walls. (&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/amebiasis/index.html"&gt;DPDx/CDC&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Ralston and her colleagues &lt;span&gt;Maura Ruyechan and Wesley Huang have discovered t&lt;/span&gt;his seemingly wasteful habit actually allows &lt;em&gt;E. histolytica&lt;/em&gt; to gather outer membrane proteins from the human cells, which it proceeds to arrange on the surface of its own body for protection against defences in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, this disguise doesn't just protect it from human immune 'guards': it works on immune responses present in the blood of other species, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It has become clear that amoebae kill human cells by performing cell nibbling, known as trogocytosis," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.04.616735"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;. "After performing trogocytosis, amoebae display human proteins on their own surface and are resistant to lysis [rupture] by human serum [a component of blood]."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This molecular disguise prevents our immune system from launching an attack on the amoeba by presenting chemical tags that identify it as safe, a bit like stealing the ID off a security guard. When &lt;em&gt;E. histolytica &lt;/em&gt;dons the human proteins CD46 and CD55, it can safely scoot past the &lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;'complement proteins' tasked with tracking down and destroying foreign cells. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This allows it to continue chomping away, forming abscesses full of liquified cells in the organs it inhabits.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, the team conducted an experiment in which they allowed the amoeba to collect material from human cells before exposing the 'disguised' parasites to mouse blood serum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although mice are not a natural host of &lt;em&gt;E. histolytica,&lt;/em&gt; experimental infection of mice with amoebae mimics many aspects of the human infection, ranging from immune responses to the host genetic determinants of susceptibility to infection," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.04.616735"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its camouflage was effective despite originating from an entirely different species, reflecting similarities between human and mouse complement protein security systems. This knowledge will allow the researchers to further investigate treatments and vaccines for the amoeba using mouse models, before proceeding to human trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Science is a process of building&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;," Ralston &lt;a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/news/wily-parasite-kills-human-cells-and-wears-their-remains-disguise"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. "&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;You have to build one tool upon another, until you're finally ready to discover new treatments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research has not yet been peer-reviewed, but it is available as a pre-print in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.04.616735"&gt;bioRxiv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Every new “surprise” – from not being able to use tampons, to an almost constant cycle of UTIs – felt all the worse for my lack of mental and practical preparation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This shouldn’t be the case: around a half of all women will have some degree of pelvic organ prolapse in their lifetime. There are four types: vaginal, uterine, bladder and rectal, all of which involve one or more pelvic organs descending into the vagina. Often, it creates an internal bulge, but when it is more progressed it can be externally visible too. Prolapse being so varied – and, crucially, understudied – makes for a great proliferation of potential symptoms which are, in my opinion, generally underplayed in healthcare literature. Living with an organ descending into your vagina is frequently described as “uncomfortable”, as though comparable to wearing a too small pair of jeans. The NHS website describes what can be truly debilitating stress urinary incontinence (SUI) as “&lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pelvic-organ-prolapse/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;problems [with] peeing&lt;/a&gt;”. What little information is available on prolapse seems designed to remind you that what you’re experiencing &lt;em&gt;is no big deal! &lt;/em&gt;But for many of us, that is far from the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"society","tags":[{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/women","type":"Keyword","title":"Women"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/sex","type":"Keyword","title":"Sex"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/childbirth","type":"Keyword","title":"Childbirth"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","type":"Keyword","title":"Health &amp;amp; wellbeing"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","type":"Keyword","title":"Life and style"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/g2","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"G2"},{"id":"theguardian/g2/features","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"Comment &amp;amp; features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-g2-features","type":"Tracking","title":"UK G2 Features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-g2-production","type":"Tracking","title":"UK G2 production"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"society/2025/may/18/the-private-pain-of-prolapse-six-things-i-wish-id-known-from-sex-to-exercise-to-mental-health","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;My own prolapse was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2025/feb/10/urogynecologist-childbirth-interview" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;caused by childbirth&lt;/a&gt;, but it can also be brought on by injury, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/menopause" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;menopause&lt;/a&gt;, age, or for simply no (as yet known by medical research) reason at all. You might have none of the symptoms and no idea you even have it; conversely, you might have all of the symptoms and yet struggle to get a diagnosis. Six years on and, while I have a general diagnosis of “pelvic organ prolapse”, I do not know &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; prolapse I have, to what degree or whether or not I have multiple prolapses. Though I’m far from content with this shocking lack of information about my condition, I – through necessity – focus on what I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know, to get through the day. Here is everything I have learned, and everything I wish I had already known about living with pelvic organ prolapse, before I had to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="penetrative-sex-will-be-different" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Penetrative sex &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be different&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When I was first diagnosed with prolapse, I didn’t think about the effect it might have on my sex life. But, as it turns out, this is probably the area of my life that’s been most negatively affected. Yes, I have stress urinary incontinence (SUI) – but when is the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; to lose control of your bladder? Yes, I have pain in my vagina – but when is the &lt;em&gt;worst&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; to feel pain in your vagina? At 29, and after a couple of nightmarish attempts at intercourse, I thought I’d never be able to have penetrative sex again; the pain was more than I could bear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;With time, however, I realised that positioning was key. Having sex on my side so that the penis would not penetrate so deeply made a huge difference. Of course, this is no good if you get off on deeper penetration – for this, a friend advises placing a cushion under your bum, to lift your pelvis up and cause your cervix to recede. We both agree that lube is a huge help in encouraging the penis to “find the path of least resistance”. And as for the SUI? I pee beforehand, even if I don’t think I really need to. For others who may be embarrassed about losing control of their bladder, I’d recommend having sex in the bath or lubed up to the nines – both blessedly simple ways to disguise bigger or smaller leaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="-and-so-will-your-period" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;… and so will your period&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While prolapse shouldn’t affect your period, your period &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;affect your prolapse. I certainly notice an increased heaviness in my vagina and, in the days before my period arrives, I feel particularly reluctant to overexert myself physically. I now experience cramping more intensely in my vagina, perhaps due to the descent of my uterus, and I have to apply heat pads to my vulva rather than abdomen (over clothing, to prevent the risk of burns). I have found using tampons and Mooncups next to impossible; my prolapse simply squeezes them out almost as soon as I insert them. Returning to pads after a decade of not using them was disheartening for me personally, and I have yet to find a brand of period pants I can get on board with. All of this caused me to turn to the coil – which has, at least, helped to alleviate my physical symptoms. It’s not for everyone, though, and while I did not experience pain with insertion myself, I would recommend anyone concerned about this to ask their healthcare provider to use a local anaesthetic gel or spray (pain relief is not routinely offered for IUD fittings).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="your-relationship-to-exercise-will-change" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Your relationship to exercise will change&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;These days, it is generally only in the lead-up to my period, or after some particularly physical exertion, that my prolapse affects my mobility – but this was not the case for the first year or two. On the worst days, merely standing up felt like a monumental effort – I’d have to squeeze my pelvic floor muscles as hard as I could to combat the sense that my cervix was going to tumble out of me. Physiotherapists told me I shouldn’t pick up my baby– almost laughably impossible advice for a new parent – which left me questioning every cuddle. Friends who like to run took news of their prolapses particularly hard. One found herself unable to run 10 metres without losing full control of her bladder; incontinence pads were a gamechanger, once she was able to get past the stigma. Another option is a pessary – a small ring inserted into the vagina to help support the organs above it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="you-may-have-more-gynaecological-infections" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;You may have more gynaecological infections&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A risk that comes with pessary use, however, is the increased chance of vaginal infections. This is due to the pessary potentially introducing bacteria into the vagina, but prolapse in general is likely to increase infections. UTIs are the most common, as the descended organs can prevent the complete emptying of the bladder, or create small leaks and pooling of urine, which is a breeding ground for bacteria. After penetrative sex, residual semen can become trapped in the pockets created by the prolapse, also creating fertile ground for infection. It may seem that the answer to these problems is more rigorous hygiene standards, but introducing harsher products and rougher cleaning habits can actually have an adverse effect on the vaginal ecosystem. I have yet to come up with a better solution than regularly purchasing over-the-counter vaginal self-testing kits and requesting targeted medication from my GP, if needed. This is time consuming and expensive, and I hope that GPs will consider offering free self-testing kits for regularly occurring gynaecological infections in future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="it-may-affect-your-future-fertility-options" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;It may affect your future fertility options&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A number of healthcare professionals informed me that if I don’t want my prolapse to get any worse, I should not get pregnant again. Avoiding vaginal birth by having a caesarean section wouldn’t help, in my case, as the pressure put on my pelvic region by carrying another baby could be enough to greatly worsen my symptoms and future outlook. Surgical repair will only be offered to me once I’ve decided not to get pregnant again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s important to note that not all sufferers of prolapse are told that they should not become pregnant: it is judged on a case-by-case basis, and if you are prepared for your prolapse to potentially worsen then, of course, you can always go ahead with it, no matter what you are advised. But having to calculate that risk can be difficult for many. There is growing evidence to suggest that pessary use in pregnancy for those with advanced prolapse can lead to best post-birth outcomes, but more research into this and other interventions is sorely needed in order to provide as much reproductive choice as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="the-mental-toll-can-feel-impossible-but-it-isnt" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;The mental toll can feel impossible – but it isn’t&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When I was first diagnosed with prolapse, I didn’t want to leave my bed. Partly, this was because every step I took felt like it was making things physically, medically, worse. But mostly, it was because of the mental toll that having a prolapse had taken on me. Doctors seemed to barely understand my condition, and shrouded it in euphemisms. I had little idea what the rest of my life was going to look like, and I suddenly – after having a baby – felt entirely alienated from my body and the child I was advised not to pick up. This is, of course, fertile grounds for postnatal depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;It is important to acknowledge just how many people are in the same boat&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Another demographic affected by pelvic organ prolapse are those experiencing menopause – people who, like those who have just given birth, are subject to vast hormonal fluctuations and are therefore more vulnerable to poor mental health. Understanding the psychological impact that gynaecological conditions can have must begin with understanding a key element of medical misogyny: that women’s health conditions are almost universally &lt;a href="https://www.aamc.org/news/why-we-know-so-little-about-women-s-health" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;understudied, undertreated, and underdiagnosed&lt;/a&gt;. Women find themselves experiencing &lt;a href="https://www.iasp-pain.org/advocacy/global-year/pain-in-women/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;more pain, and with less likelihood of diagnosis and treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This can feel frustrating, like the system is stacked against us. But it is important to acknowledge just how many people are in the same boat; to campaign for better treatment options, and to work together to destigmatise conditions that are not talked about enough. Sharing my prolapse story with others, and then having so many people share their experiences with me, helped me to shed the shame I had initially felt at my body’s betrayal. Talking about how to achieve better sex, or how to manage my period, gave me a toolkit with which to move forward. We still need meaningful, institutional reform but, for now, I’m grateful not to be too ashamed to wear an incontinence pad if I need to.

Using brain scans from a diverse population sample, researchers found that poor blood sugar control may contribute to this structural brain change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strongest associations were seen in Hispanic participants, emphasizing the need for tailored interventions to manage diabetes and protect brain health.

If left uncontrolled, it can lead to serious health problems affecting the circulatory, nervous, and immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team found that individuals with T2DM exhibited a significantly thinner cortex, particularly in the temporal and parietal regions of the brain, which are critical for memory and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers utilized advanced neuroimaging techniques to analyze cortical thickness and hippocampal volume in participants from the Health and Aging Brain Study-Health Disparities (HABS-HD) cohort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s diverse sample, comprising Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, and non-Hispanic white adults, provides critical insights into how diabetes affects brain health across different populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found poor glycemic control may be a key driver of the observed association between T2DM and cortical thinning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “Since blood sugar levels can be managed with proper treatment and lifestyle interventions, our findings highlight the potential for protecting brain health through better diabetes management,” says Amaryllis A. Tsiknia, the PhD student who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the association between T2DM and cortical thinning remained strong even after accounting for socioeconomic factors and common comorbidities such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity. Hispanic participants showed the strongest associations, while no significant effects were observed among non-Hispanic Black adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the rising prevalence of diabetes, particularly among minority populations, these results underscore the urgent need for targeted interventions to improve diabetes management and mitigate its neurological consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; “The disparities we observed by ethnic and racial group suggest that more work is needed to understand how exposures to various risk factors can work together in distinct ways across different people to determine brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Gaining this understanding is the first step in advancing personalized care that best protects the brain and cognition for each individual,” explained senior author Meredith N. Braskie, PhD, assistant professor of neurology, and a HABS-HD co-lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study and its results highlight the significant role of large-scale initiatives like HABS-HD, which is the most comprehensive study of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias in diverse communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“HABS-HD provides invaluable data, including interviews, functional exams, blood draws, cognitive testing, brain MRIs, and clinical lab work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This data can lead to significant discoveries, such as this study’s link between type 2 diabetes and cortical thickness, underscoring the importance of the large-scale and global initiatives we specialize in at the Stevens INI,” said Stevens INI director Arthur W.

We examined T2DM associations with cortical thickness and hippocampal volume in ethnoracially diverse, cognitively unimpaired older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="dad270088-sec-0020-title"&gt;METHODS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2171 cognitively unimpaired older adults, we examined (1) how T2DM related to cortical thickness and hippocampal volume, (2) whether associations were independent of socioeconomic factors and comorbidities, (3) whether associations were driven by hyperglycemia or hyperinsulinemia, and (4) how associations varied by self-reported race/ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="dad270088-sec-0030-title"&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;T2DM was correlated with thinner cortex independent of socioeconomic factors and comorbidities, and this was driven by higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Higher HbA1c levels were correlated with thinner cortex in diabetics and non-diabetics. T2DM–cortical thickness associations were strong and widespread in Hispanic participants, modest and limited to temporal regions in non-Hispanic White participants, and not present in non-Hispanic Black adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="dad270088-sec-0040-title"&gt;DISCUSSION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;T2DM is associated with a thinner cortex, and this is driven by poor glycemic control.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 18 May 2025 12:58:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE8yR2V0bkNFRG9uS3haM2dRVVdycDJZNUNPZ0JiVjZxWXN0WVQ4ZDRSdU1IblJqUEw2MUFWV0IwYnA5ZWVORmgyOTZrZW9hc1c0Q1dZc2VCR1BKUDBQTVBKY1hBaWhhVndXTmJV</guid></item><item><title>父母的年龄、血统和习惯塑造新的DNA突变-神经科学新闻 | Parents’ Age, Ancestry, and Habits Shape New DNA Mutations - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE1LcnBKeUN0Mnk2ajBPQUtMM3NTUlc2UVBGRGZFaGt6eHp2WmtEcW9NaGZWQkxYRWZVY09kdTdpclJvcTIzdVBJXzVSYkx1VW94a09Ea1RmNS1hX0VWSnlKN2tnRGh3V1ZpWkR4eURtVXN4STVyalpTRk9nTQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A massive genomic study has revealed that parental age, ancestry, and smoking habits subtly influence the number of new genetic mutations (de novo mutations) passed from parents to children. By analyzing whole-genome data from 10,000 parent-child trios, researchers found that most variation in mutation rates comes from parental age, especially the father’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, small differences were also observed between ancestry groups and in children of parents with a smoking history. These findings challenge the assumption that mutation rates are uniform across populations and environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age Dominates:&lt;/strong&gt; Paternal age adds ~1.5 mutations per year; maternal age adds ~0.4.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ancestry Differences:&lt;/strong&gt; Slightly higher mutation rates seen in African ancestry groups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoking Effect:&lt;/strong&gt; Parental smoking linked to a ~2% increase in mutation count in offspring.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Wellcome Sanger Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ancestry and lifestyle choices of parents may affect the rate and type of new genetic changes that arise in their children, new research has found.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt; (15 May), researchers from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, the University of Cambridge and their collaborators analysed whole-genome sequence data from 10,000 parent-child ‘trios’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They studied the influence of ancestry, common genetic variants and environmental factors on the rates and types of &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; mutations (DNMs) – genetic changes that arise in the egg or sperm and are passed down to offspring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110083"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce.jpg" alt="This shows a mom and her kids, and DNA." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/genetics-ancestry-lifestyle-neurosciecnce-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers note that it is too early to say whether parental smoking directly causes these new mutations, as it may just be associated with other mutagens. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on factors that influence the rate and patterns of new genetic variation in humans. The results will also inform future studies in population and medical genetics in which models of mutation rate are important parameters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germ cells – eggs and sperm – maintain integrity of genetic information which is passed down to children. While most new changes occurring in the DNA tend to be either harmless or mildly detrimental, a small fraction can lead to severe genetic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the mutation rate in germ cells is kept exceptionally low to reduce the risk of passing on harmful changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst scientists know that increasing parental age – particularly paternal age – is linked with more genetic changes in germ cells, this factor only explains a certain amount of variation in mutation rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from effects of chemotherapy and rare variants in genes involved in DNA repair, little is known about other factors influencing the rate of DNMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, researchers sought to explore the influence of ancestry, common genetic variants and smoking on rates and patterns of DNMs that arise in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They conducted the largest study of DNMs to date, analysing around 10,000 whole genomes of parent-child ‘trios’ – two parents and their child – from the 100,000 Genomes Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparing each child’s DNA with that of their parents, the scientists could identify new genetic variants that arose in the egg or sperm and were passed on to the child, but which were not present in the parents’ genomes. This approach allowed the team to build a catalogue of nearly 690,000 DNMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study revealed that different ancestry groups have small differences in the number of new genetic mutations passed to children – for example, there was an average of about 64 new DNMs per generation in European, American, and South Asian groups, compared to about 67 in African groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, parental age, especially the father’s age, has a much bigger impact. Each year of a father’s age adds around 1.5 mutations, whereas each year of a mother’s age adds about 0.4. So, the difference between parents with African versus other genetic ancestries is about the same as having a father who is two years older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that the differences could stem from environmental influences and/or genetic factors that differ between populations​.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, they did not find any evidence that common genetic variation influences rates of DNMs within people of European ancestry, although this does not rule out that average genetic differences between ancestry groups contribute to differences in DNM rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also uncovered a link between parental smoking and higher DNM rates in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that children of parents who had documented smoking history in their health records showed a small but statistically significant increase in the number of DNMs, compared to children of non-smokers​. The analysis suggests an average of roughly two per cent rise in mutation count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect is very small – the equivalent of less than one additional DNM per smoking parent over their reproductive lifespan, similar to the effect of having the father be a year older at the time of conception​.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that it is too early to say whether parental smoking directly &lt;em&gt;causes&lt;/em&gt; these new mutations, as it may just be associated with other mutagens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this study is a significant step forward in looking at how the genetic ancestry and lifestyle of parents correlate with rates of new genetic changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings may have an influence on future genetic studies on population history and dynamics, as well as studies seeking to identify genes implicated in rare disorders using DNMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies currently assume the same rate and pattern of DNA changes for all ancestry groups. It is possible that adjustments to current models to take into account these new findings may make them more powerful or help refine conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The sheer scale of the 100,000 Genomes Project presented a great opportunity to look into the effects and exposures that explain rates and patterns of DNA changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The takeaway is that rates of &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; mutation are mostly driven by parental age, but ancestry and environmental factors such as smoking may make a small imprint.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Aylwyn Scally,co-senior author at the University of Cambridge, commented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Whilst evolution has done its best to develop mechanisms to protect the DNA we pass on to our offspring, our study has shown that it’s not fully protected from certain exposures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Future studies on larger datasets and with richer data on environmental exposures may reveal additional important factors that influence variation in &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; mutation rate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Raheleh Rahbari,co-senior author and Group Leader at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“New genetic changes that arise in egg or sperm cells give rise to genetic diversity within a population, making each one of us unique, but they can also cause rare genetic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In our study, we’ve been able to see for the first time that a person’s ancestry and even lifestyle choices of their family, such as smoking, are associated with the number of new DNA changes that arise in their genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These effects are small, but nonetheless these findings increase our understanding of factors associated with this fundamental biological process,” said Dr Hilary Martin,co-senior author and Group Leader at the Wellcome Sanger Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research was funded by the National Institute for Health Research and NHS England who fund The National Genomic Research library.

Researchers found that a single dose of amphetamine disrupted mice’s ability to judge time accurately by altering how neurons in the prefrontal cortex represent time. The findings suggest that amphetamine impairs cognitive functions by increasing the variability of neural signals that encode time, a core component of decision-making and attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amphetamine is a powerful stimulant that increases levels of chemicals like dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain. While it can temporarily enhance focus or alertness, it also has well-documented side effects, especially when taken in high doses or without medical supervision. One area of concern is its effect on executive functions—higher-order processes that include planning, attention, and self-control. The prefrontal cortex, a brain region involved in these functions, has been shown to be especially sensitive to changes in dopamine levels, which are significantly affected by amphetamine use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study, led by Matthew Weber and &lt;a href="https://narayanan.lab.uiowa.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Nandakumar Narayanan&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Iowa, sought to better understand how amphetamine affects brain activity during tasks requiring executive control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Amphetamine is a commonly abused drug that causes dopamine to be released from neurons and prevents reuptake of dopamine. We know that amphetamine can have a huge impact on cognitive function, but it is unknown why or how. We conducted this study to investigate basic mechanisms of how amphetamine affects cognitive function,” said Narayanan, Juanita J. Bartlett Professor and director of the Center for Neurodegeneration at the University of Iowa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this, the researchers turned to interval timing—a behavioral task in which animals must estimate time intervals of several seconds to earn a reward. Interval timing is widely used in both animal and human research because it depends on the prefrontal cortex and requires attention and working memory. Importantly, this task provides a way to measure not only how accurate a subject is in judging time but also how consistent their judgments are from trial to trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team approached this question in two parts. First, they conducted a meta-analysis of 15 previously published rodent studies on amphetamine and interval timing. They found that amphetamine had a significant effect on timing precision, making animals’ estimates of time more variable. While it also had an effect on timing accuracy—whether the timing was generally early or late—the impact on variability was stronger. These findings established a reliable link between amphetamine use and disrupted temporal judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, the team conducted their own experiment using mice trained on a well-established version of the interval timing task. The mice were taught to switch between two response ports based on how much time had passed, with rewards given for correct timing. After several weeks of training, the researchers implanted electrodes in the mice’s prefrontal cortex to monitor the activity of individual neurons during the task. On the first day, the mice received a saline injection before the task, serving as a baseline. On the second day, they were given an injection of amphetamine before performing the same task again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behaviorally, the mice showed increased variability in their timing after receiving amphetamine. Although their average timing shifted slightly earlier, the more noticeable effect was the inconsistency in when they made their decisions. This change echoed the results of the earlier meta-analysis and suggested that amphetamine made it harder for the mice to maintain steady estimates of time across trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the neural level, the researchers focused on patterns of activity known as “ramping”—gradual changes in firing rates of neurons that occur during the timed interval. This kind of activity is thought to reflect how the brain keeps track of time. Under normal conditions, many prefrontal neurons show a steady increase or decrease in activity during the interval. However, after amphetamine was administered, this ramping activity became significantly more variable. The average rate of firing didn’t change, but the consistency of the ramping pattern from trial to trial did. This suggests that the brain’s internal clock was no longer functioning reliably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We guessed that amphetamine would impair brain function, but we were surprised that amphetamine disrupted how these neurons work together,” Narayanan told PsyPost. “We can measure how neurons work together and found that amphetamine weakened these interactions. This provides fresh insight into how neurons in the prefrontal cortex cooperate and how amphetamine degrades this cooperation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found that the coordination between neurons was weakened after amphetamine exposure. Neurons that normally showed synchronized activity during the task became less functionally connected. Using joint activity measurements between pairs of neurons, the researchers showed that the cooperative firing patterns seen under normal conditions were diminished when the drug was introduced. These weakened interactions may reflect a breakdown in the neural networks that support complex timing and decision-making processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key finding involved low-frequency brain rhythms in the 2–5 Hz range, often linked to cognitive control and attention. These oscillations were noticeably reduced in the prefrontal cortex after amphetamine administration. Prior research has suggested that such brain rhythms play an important role in organizing neural activity during tasks that require sustained focus or timing. Their disruption may further explain the loss of precision observed in the behavioral data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the results provide strong evidence that amphetamine affects how the brain processes time by disrupting the consistency and coordination of neural activity in the prefrontal cortex. The effects were observed after a single dose of the drug, indicating that even acute exposure can interfere with core aspects of executive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We focused on a simple cognitive behavior—timing intervals of a few seconds, which helps guide our everyday interactions with the world,” Narayanan explained. “Our study, which was in rodents and focused on the prefrontal cortex, offers a unique glimpse into how amphetamine affects this cognitive behavior. We believe that this is relevant for understanding drugs of abuse, treatments, and also diseases like Parkinson’s disease and schizophrenia that involve dopamine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with any study, there are limitations to consider. First, while the dose used was consistent with previous studies, it reflects the higher end of the range used in rodent research and may not correspond precisely to typical human use. Second, the drug was administered systemically, affecting the entire brain. Although the researchers focused on the prefrontal cortex, amphetamine also impacts other regions such as the striatum, which is involved in timing accuracy. Future research will be needed to isolate the specific contributions of different brain areas and neurotransmitter systems to the observed behavioral changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that the study only examined the effects of a single dose. It is still unclear how repeated or chronic use of amphetamine might influence temporal processing and neural coordination over time. The researchers suggest that future studies could combine this type of neural recording with techniques that allow more precise manipulation of brain circuits, such as optogenetics, to better understand the causal relationship between neuronal variability and timing behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study was in rodents, so we have to be careful when translating our results to humans,” Narayanan noted. “However, the reason that we study timing behavior is that all mammals, from rodents to humans, have similar brain processes that help guide our actions in time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Amphetamine is a complex drug that affects many different regions of the brain. We are studying how other brain areas are involved and developing much more specific methods to investigate how amphetamine affects cognitive function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to learn how dopamine affects the neural circuitry of cognition,” Narayanan added. “Through hard work and rigorous science, this knowledge will lead to new biomarkers, and maybe even new treatments for diseases that impair cognition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The only way we develop new knowledge like this is through careful and rigorous science—we’d like to thank the American public and the National Institutes of Health for funding this work. We hope to keep working on this problem to come up with a better understanding of, and better treatments for, amphetamine addiction, ADHD, Parkinson’s disease, and schizophrenia.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2025.110486" target="_blank"&gt;Amphetamine increases timing variability by degrading prefrontal temporal encoding&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Matthew A.

&lt;p&gt;A virus largely unknown outside scientific circles is spreading rapidly across parts of &lt;strong&gt;Latin America&lt;/strong&gt;, drawing comparisons to &lt;em&gt;Zika&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;dengue&lt;/em&gt; and prompting concern from epidemiologists. Known as the &lt;strong&gt;oropouche virus&lt;/strong&gt;, it has already infected over &lt;strong&gt;20,000 people&lt;/strong&gt; in the region since late 2023, with confirmed cases across &lt;strong&gt;Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Bolivia&lt;/strong&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;Caribbean&lt;/strong&gt;. The virus, first documented in &lt;strong&gt;1955&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Trinidad and Tobago&lt;/em&gt;, is now being watched closely by international health researchers who warn of its “massively under-diagnosed” presence in tropical regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Virus Mistaken for Zika or Dengue for Decades&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Oropouche virus symptoms are frequently mistaken for those of &lt;em&gt;dengue&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Zika&lt;/em&gt;, leading to widespread underreporting. Patients often present with &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/05/this-ancient-killer-is-rapidly-becoming-resistant-to-antibiotics-making-it-deadlier-than-ever-before/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="89396" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;fever, headaches, joint and muscle pain, chills, nausea, vomiting,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;skin rashes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While many recover, some develop more serious conditions such as &lt;strong&gt;viral meningitis&lt;/strong&gt;, a brain infection that can result in severe complications. Because the symptoms are so similar to those of other mosquito-borne diseases, misdiagnosis is common and has masked the virus’s true spread for years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recent findings by a team at &lt;strong&gt;Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin&lt;/strong&gt;, led by &lt;strong&gt;Professor Jan Felix Drexler&lt;/strong&gt;, have shown that oropouche virus infections are far more widespread than previously believed. In a study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(25)00110-0/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Lancet Infectious Diseases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, Drexler’s team analyzed over &lt;strong&gt;9,400 blood samples&lt;/strong&gt; collected in &lt;strong&gt;Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Peru&lt;/strong&gt; between 2001 and 2022. The presence of antibodies revealed that, across all regions, around &lt;strong&gt;6%&lt;/strong&gt; of people had been exposed to the virus. In parts of the &lt;strong&gt;Amazon&lt;/strong&gt;, this number climbed to over &lt;strong&gt;10%&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;






&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Climate Change and El Niño Amplify the Spread&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The current spread of oropouche virus appears to be driven largely by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/earths-arctic-region-flips-releasing-more-co%e2%82%82-than-it-absorbs-for-the-first-time/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="77239" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;climatic conditions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, particularly consistent &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/05/discovery-atlantic-global-consequences/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="88252" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;heat and rainfall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Researchers believe that weather events like &lt;strong&gt;El Niño&lt;/strong&gt;, which increase humidity and temperatures across the tropics, have played a major role in creating ideal breeding conditions for the virus’s insect vectors. Unlike traditional mosquitoes, oropouche is spread by tiny biting midges known as &lt;strong&gt;Ceratopogonidae&lt;/strong&gt; — insects small enough to pass through conventional mosquito nets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Machine learning models used by Drexler’s team suggest that these climate conditions are the most significant contributors to the virus’s transmission patterns. The virus remains most prevalent in the &lt;strong&gt;Amazon rainforest&lt;/strong&gt;, but high-risk zones have also been identified across &lt;strong&gt;Central America&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;Caribbean&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;southern coastal Brazil&lt;/strong&gt;. People living in higher-altitude regions were found to be less affected, as the cooler temperatures reduce insect activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Rising Risks for Pregnant Women&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health researchers are now turning their attention to the virus’s potential impact on &lt;strong&gt;pregnant women&lt;/strong&gt;. Recent reports from affected countries include &lt;strong&gt;two deaths&lt;/strong&gt; of young, healthy women and &lt;strong&gt;several cases&lt;/strong&gt; where infection during pregnancy appeared to cause &lt;strong&gt;miscarriages&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;congenital malformations&lt;/strong&gt;. While Drexler notes that oropouche seems to harm unborn babies “less frequently than Zika,” the full extent of its effects remains unclear and needs further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“There is still relatively little known about the virus,” Drexler said, emphasizing the need for urgent research into how the virus affects fetal development. With no vaccine or specific treatment currently available, health experts are urging people in high-risk areas — especially women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant — to take strong precautions. These include wearing &lt;strong&gt;long-sleeved clothing&lt;/strong&gt;, using &lt;strong&gt;insect repellents&lt;/strong&gt; like &lt;em&gt;DEET&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;icaridin&lt;/em&gt;, and seeking medical advice before traveling to affected regions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Insect Control Remains the Only Defense&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite its growing prevalence, the oropouche virus remains without a &lt;strong&gt;licensed vaccine&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;approved antiviral treatment&lt;/strong&gt;. For now, protection hinges on preventing bites from the midges that carry the disease. Unlike the more widely known &lt;em&gt;Aedes&lt;/em&gt; mosquitoes, the midges that transmit oropouche are extremely small — often no larger than &lt;strong&gt;3 millimeters&lt;/strong&gt; — and are able to pass through many types of &lt;strong&gt;mosquito netting&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because of this, &lt;strong&gt;fine-mesh nets&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;protective clothing&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;repellents&lt;/strong&gt; are currently the only effective defenses. Drexler warns that as long as high infection rates persist and the virus remains poorly understood, the public — particularly in the &lt;strong&gt;Amazon basin&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;tropical lowlands&lt;/strong&gt; — should remain cautious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

In newborns, hospitalizations decreased by as much as 71%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Heather Auerbach, an emergency physician, noticed that trend, saying: “There was definitely less RSV this year compared to the last two to three years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The young children who did get sick enough to go to the emergency room often needed lower levels of care, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I think I saw fewer critically ill kids from it this year than I have the last couple of years,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Even if the kids get sick and even if they wind up in the hospital, there’s a difference between just needing some suction and oxygen versus needing to be on high flow [oxygen] or BiPap or in the PICU or things like that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Auerbach wishes her own family could have benefited from the RSV shots, sharing that her son was hospitalized with RSV in January 2020 when he was only three weeks old. He was born full-term with no complications, and then he got sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“All of a sudden, his breathing had just gotten much worse,” Auerbach said. He was less alert and started using his stomach muscles to help him breathe – classic signs of respiratory complications with RSV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Even when infants don’t show these signs, they are still at risk from RSV infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Little babies with RSV can have periods of apnea where they stop breathing, and it can happen suddenly, even if they don’t have other symptoms,” Auerbach said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Her son was admitted to the hospital, and when he returned home, she and her husband, who is also a physician, needed to suction away mucus regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I wish the shot had been around then, but we were a few years too early,” Auerbach said. “I genuinely think that could have saved him a hospitalization.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For parents, a child’s RSV hospitalization can be a wrenching time, full of uncertainty and fear. Hospital stays of any length are disruptive and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Kids get very, very sick from this” without vaccines and preventative treatments, and preventing any of that is a major breakthrough, Auerbach said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;She also wonders whether the shots could have prevented, even for a time, additional complications down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Her son started wheezing a few months after his illness. He received an asthma diagnosis, which was “very early and unusual”. Auerbach, her husband and their son’s pulmonologist believe it was related to the RSV infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“There’s no guarantee that he may not have ended up with [asthma] regardless. But do I think he would have had it at six months? No,” Auerbach said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;According to one tool for tracking RSV hospitalizations, the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/php/surveillance/rsv-net.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;RSV-Net&lt;/a&gt;, the peak in hospitalizations for children under the age of one this year was roughly half of that at the height of the 2023-24 season, and one-third the peak of the 2022-23 season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Such a dramatic decline only holds for these very young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Children aged 1-4 and 5-17 had higher rates of hospitalization from RSV this winter compared with last winter, according to RSV-Net.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Higher RSV hospitalization rates in older children – who are not eligible for RSV prevention products – suggest this season may have been more severe than previous seasons,” Jasmine Reed, a CDC spokesperson, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Notably, hospitalization rates in babies under three months old were half of previous seasons.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Typically, more young infants are hospitalized during worse RSV seasons. That hospitalization rates still “dropped markedly” among babies likely means the shots are working well, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It could mean the shots are working even better than the numbers indicate, because the drop in hospitalizations is occurring even amid a more severe season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;These trends track with the new CDC study. Babies under eight months old had a decrease in RSV hospitalizations of 43%, according to RSV-Net, or 28%, according to the New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When the researchers excluded Houston from NVSN data – the city saw an early RSV season before preventatives were widely available – that drop went from 28% to 56%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The biggest change happened among newborns under the age of two months – the most vulnerable group to RSV infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In these very young babies, RSV hospitalization dropped by 52%, according to RSV-Net. The rate dropped by 45%, according to NVSN – but when Houston was excluded, the decrease was 71%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Older children did not see the same benefit, indicating that the shots are behind the decrease, rather than a change in behavior, testing or transmission rates, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="b838a10c-fa52-4502-a284-5027dd9914d6" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":31,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Trump health cuts create ‘real danger’ around disease outbreaks, workers warn","elementId":"b838a10c-fa52-4502-a284-5027dd9914d6","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/11/health-cuts-trump-disease-outbreaks"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Children older than eight months, who were largely not eligible for the preventatives, were hospitalized at higher rates this winter compared with the same times in 2018–20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;That means the significant drop in young infants’ hospitalizations now could be an underestimate, researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The monoclonal antibody treatment, nirsevimab, may be given to babies under eight months old either at birth, if they are born during RSV season, or as they enter winter. It is given to babies aged eight to 19 months old if they’re at high risk because of medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A vaccine for pregnant people, Pfizer’s Abrysvo, is offered in the third trimester during RSV season, which is usually between September and January. Those antibodies offer protection to newborns for several months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The study shows how high uptake of the vaccines and preventative treatments “can lead to remarkable public health impact in protecting young babies from severe illness”, Reed said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Increased use of RSV prevention products during future seasons might lead to even larger reductions in RSV hospitalizations among infants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sun, 18 May 2025 11:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxQdjVTWWQwQVpfNk9jcFJaRjZubWVBWnQxbVRYNzZ3QlVGUFhuejg0OE90bWtmNWZpdmtwbHVaRjlYc3RmY0tNeUJZUVk5c0k1OVQyRmI1WWNjQXpVV1hPcEQ1XzNra2JRV25ydUFMZEZCZDMzdHhIdGphTUdZWVpsX3NDM25qZlhwUGZmYQ</guid></item><item><title>营养师分享一种令人惊讶的食物，可以在您生病时提供帮助- HuffPost | Dietitians Share A Surprising Food That Can Help When You’re Sick - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixgFBVV95cUxPNjlWZEIyc3l1N2wwVmNWMDhPRlBnNkdCMEdzUVd3aDliS3hIaWZodlVfY3l1R1JVazdKQmhNWXB5WjY3ZGJHOHVBS2tGaEhTc2lVLTdSWlNEdUtXMlg2MWlwYThsM013UXU3NlJfZXFLSjNVWUFmamZRQi1iUGZZb1BCcWxIR2Z1dkZYQkQtaUNyV3dnVXl3SzVvZ2lCX0ItZW14UDZlTk0zcXBqYjJtdjV5clpMdEllaDJHQmIxY3dGRWlGYnfSAcsBQVVfeXFMUG9HYS16Y2dmYnpaaTgxN1QwbG5JdlpFaWtzTlMyWkxteGFGd0ZTMlMtczVyRURwdE4zZjVxYmVfeW5YTExfLVNIQXctWjl6R2dvcFZKSW92aEJxN1hKVXdPejdvTGpDeDczNkJwZGE3NnpoWFNlTWdxc3JmMU9UQ2I4WDlCcnY1ZkhMVDllakczaWpmR3R2X2pNN2tZOHRJSFpFZVIwWk1yMUlheWR2ZmJOWTN3RE9BS2lGNmRtcVEtUHhJa1o0WllOaEU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When you’re confined to your bed with the flu or feeling annoyed about a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/persistent-cough-not-covid_l_656f1f74e4b0f3e5f44aca8f" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="cough that won’t go away" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68264abee4b029d8a6109dc2" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="656f1f74e4b0f3e5f44aca8f" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;cough that won’t go away&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, you may be more intentional about incorporating health-promoting foods (the ones you can stomach, at least, when nausea is a symptom). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/foods-for-cold-and-flu-season_l_670bd26ae4b04266ae855350" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="best foods and drinks during cold and flu season" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68264abee4b029d8a6109dc2" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="670bd26ae4b04266ae855350" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;best foods and drinks during cold and flu season&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; are ones that likely come to mind first, like ginger and tea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last thing that may come to mind is a dessert or something sweet.

The technique, called dynamic light scattering spectroscopy, measures microscopic protein movement in the retina and could offer a faster, cheaper, and more accessible way to screen for the disease in its earliest stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia, a progressive neurological condition that gradually impairs memory, reasoning, and other cognitive abilities. It typically develops over many years, and by the time symptoms are obvious enough for a diagnosis, irreversible damage has often already occurred in the brain. That delay has made early detection a top priority in Alzheimer’s research, with hopes that identifying the disease sooner could allow for earlier interventions and better outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The current ‘gold standard’ diagnostic method for Alzheimer’s disease is a PET scan. These are expensive, invasive, and uncomfortable for the patient, only to produce a qualitative reading that is accurate around 70% of the time in identifying the disease at a stage well beyond the point of any remedial action,” explained study author Jeffrey N. Weiss, the founder of &lt;a href="https://www.micronophthalmic.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Micron Ophthalmic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was clear to me that something had to change. In my work as a physician and electrical engineer, I had employed dynamic light scattering spectroscopy and knew that it could be useful in providing a rapid, cost-effective, noninvasive, and quantitative measurement. Most impressively, we’ve seen that the technology is capable of diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease at least two years earlier than any current method, opening the window for preventative care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dynamic light scattering measures how proteins naturally move in the body—a type of motion known as Brownian movement. Since molecular changes often occur before physical damage or visible symptoms appear, Weiss believed dynamic light scattering spectroscopy could detect the earliest signals of Alzheimer’s disease. Because the retina develops from the same tissue as the brain during fetal development, it offers a unique and accessible window into neurological health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test this theory, Weiss developed a dynamic light scattering spectroscopy device that works in tandem with a standard ophthalmic fundus camera. During the procedure, a patient’s pupil is dilated using common eye drops. The patient then stares at a dim red light while the system collects data for just five seconds. Embedded software captures and analyzes the patterns of protein motion in the retina, producing an autocorrelation curve—a mathematical representation of molecular activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved several groups of participants. First, Weiss tested the reproducibility of the dynamic light scattering measurements by examining 17 healthy individuals with no history of neurological or eye disorders. The results were consistent across multiple variables, including sex, time of day, and whether the left or right eye was used. Importantly, the measurements were not affected by the participants’ age, suggesting that the test can reliably be used in older populations who are most at risk for Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, Weiss tested 15 individuals with mild cognitive impairment but no diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. Of these, four participants showed a distinctive pattern in their results indicating slower protein motion. These individuals went on to receive a formal Alzheimer’s diagnosis six to twelve months later, supporting the idea that dynamic light scattering spectroscopy might detect the disease well before clinical symptoms develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also included 17 individuals who had already been diagnosed with probable Alzheimer’s disease. Eleven of these participants had previously tested positive for amyloid buildup using PET scans. In all 11 cases, dynamic light scattering spectroscopy testing correctly identified the Alzheimer’s pattern. Of the remaining six, five were correctly classified as negative based on both PET and DLS results. One participant, who had a negative PET scan, showed a borderline DLS reading that may suggest very early changes missed by current imaging techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key feature observed in the dynamic light scattering measurements was a flattening of the initial portion of the autocorrelation curve in patients with Alzheimer’s. This flattening reflects a slowing in the movement of retinal proteins, a signal that likely corresponds to early dysfunction in the retinal nerve fiber layer—an area known to be affected in Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional eye imaging techniques, such as optical coherence tomography, can also detect changes in this layer, but typically only after significant damage has occurred. In contrast, dynamic light scattering spectroscopy captures molecular-level changes that precede visible structural damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major advantage of dynamic light scattering spectroscopy over other diagnostic tools is its accessibility. The test is quick, noninvasive, and inexpensive—costing only a few cents to perform and requiring no disposable components. It could be used in community clinics, nursing homes, and low-resource settings where PET scans or spinal taps are impractical. Additionally, the technology avoids common confounding variables that affect optical coherence tomography, such as glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, or diabetic retinopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The retina is an outgrowth of the brain—it is important to acknowledge its growing relevance as an active observation site for biomarkers related to Alzheimer’s disease,” Weiss told PsyPost. “The test itself addresses many of the major issues in Alzheimer’s diagnostics: the complexity of testing in vulnerable populations, the cost-effectiveness of those tests, the elimination of ambiguity or subjectivity in the results, and most importantly, the stage at which we are able to identify the disease. In this regard, I hope that these findings suggest that there is hope in tackling what has previously felt impossible—treating the disease before there are symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these promising results, the study has limitations. The sample sizes were small, and the research was conducted in a single setting. Although the test demonstrated strong predictive potential, larger studies across more diverse populations are needed to confirm its accuracy and reliability. Further work is also needed to determine whether eye diseases that affect the retina could interfere with dynamic light scattering measurements, even if the eye appears healthy during routine examination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The next milestone for this device is to build a sufficient body of evidence that our findings become irrefutable,” Weiss said. “For this, we need to place the machines in a variety of Alzheimer’s sites and assess the results that are generated. After this, the obvious next step is to engage with the FDA process, with the objective being to approve the device for wider use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a host of options from there, but one that looks particularly enticing in terms of creating a generational impact through this invention is to use it as an accompaniment for Alzheimer’s drug trials. It can collect far more data, at far shorter intervals, for a far lower cost than any other technology currently employed for this purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/13872877241301802" target="_blank"&gt;Dynamic light scattering of the eye in the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;,” was published on November 25, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 18 May 2025 10:15:57 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxOS3VEbUloVjBWMHZlVkVSREZLeXdYdEYyMTEzRFdrMDRJSHBJeXktaEpXX1VjNkEyNGttdTAwckw4eEJtaU5ZXzZFOXR4bHJjR0Fkcy00a2MtQi1zZmJMMXAxRFJHeU50RmNkVWZmOUFnWVFIUnFwdTU1bDFLZ1AxYTVnb1Z1cElIWWNiXzZHNlZtbWhRQklSZ3BDbzVkY0NZX2NVaHdQTm5IMkdUbkNoWQ</guid></item><item><title>外科医生首次进行人膀胱移植-《纽约时报》 | Surgeons Perform First Human Bladder Transplant - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE5KSHpCNTFTMUM4RmRRWkdyVjk5OGdRR3BmcU5CUUpQdGYzOU1VOVI3UjNocFlHTHZzM1FCYkppWUJJTF9XUm1EUUtvcUpOeDVZcGxUZ2xwU0dpZnVRazFkZGItRk1WeGc1M3l2bWdtdlo5ZFZEQ3k5UFZCaw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Surgeons in Southern California have performed the first human bladder transplant, introducing a new, potentially life-changing procedure for people with debilitating bladder conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The operation was performed earlier this month by a pair of surgeons from the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of Southern California on a 41-year-old man who had lost much of his bladder capacity from treatments for a rare form of bladder cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“I was a ticking time bomb,” the patient, Oscar Larrainzar, said on Thursday during a follow-up appointment with his doctors. “But now I have hope.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The doctors plan to perform bladder transplants in four more patients as part of a &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.uclahealth.org/clinical-trials/deceased-donor-bladder-or-combined-kidney-bladder" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; to get a sense of outcomes like bladder capacity and graft complications before pursuing a larger trial to expand its use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://keck.usc.edu/faculty-search/inderbir-singh-gill/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Inderbir Gill&lt;/a&gt;, who performed the surgery along with &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://profiles.ucla.edu/nima.nassiri" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Nima Nassiri&lt;/a&gt;, called it “the realization of a dream” for treating thousands of patients with crippling pelvic pain, inflammation and recurrent infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“There is no question: A potential door has been opened for these people that did not exist earlier,” said Dr. Gill, the chairman of the urology department at U.S.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

								&lt;p&gt;In 2008, Kurt started to experience things that hadn't bothered him before: dry skin, fatigue, irregular bowel movements and a white coating that formed over his tongue. For years, he saw both traditional doctors and &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2015/09/05/the_dark_side_of_alternative_medicine_and_holistic_healing_partner/" target="_blank"&gt;holistic medicine&lt;/a&gt; providers, who recommended or prescribed certain treatments to help him feel better. But he didn’t see much progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To try and find a solution, he started researching his symptoms online, where he came across a forum of people reporting their experiences with parasite cleanses. Soon after, he bought a 30-day protocol, marketed to rid the body of &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/parasites" target="_blank"&gt;parasites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nothing was working,” Kurt, who is using his first name only for privacy reasons, told Salon in a phone interview. “I was kind of just willing to try anything.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parasite cleanses have been around for decades, but they have recently &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=parasite%20cleanse&amp;amp;t=1747162348188"&gt;surged in popularity on social media&lt;/a&gt;, with influencers and companies endorsing products or homemade solutions that promise to rid the body of harmful intestinal worms. Many doctors say the likelihood of having an intestinal parasite in the U.S. is relatively low and recommend people see a health care provider to get tested for a parasite if they think they have one rather than turning to online therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While many people report positive impacts when taking herbal supplements, these substances can come with side effects and contraindications just like pharmaceutical medications. Some of the ingredients included in these cleanses can be harmful when taken too frequently or at too large of a dose, and these formulations could also impact the natural balance of bacteria in the gut keeping us healthy. In any case, self-medicating with supplements online inherently carries its own risks, said Dr. Thomas Moore, an infectious disease doctor at the University of Kansas School of Medicine at Wichita.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If someone does have a parasite, there is actual medicine to address those parasites,” Moore told Salon in a phone interview. “There is no need to go on the internet for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The prevalence of intestinal parasites in the U.S.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of parasites have the ability to infect humans, including lice, mites and ticks. However, parasite cleanses typically promise to purge the body of intestinal parasites such as tapeworms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="right_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If someone does have a parasite, there is actual medicine to address those parasites. There is no need to go on the internet for it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of intestinal parasites that have historically infected humans have been declining in prevalence and are currently rare in the United States, according to a 2023 review in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893395223001229"&gt;Modern Pathology&lt;/a&gt;. Hookworms, for example, used to devastate communities in the South, but they were &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/how-a-worm-gave-the-south-a-bad-name/"&gt;by and large eradicated with the introduction of indoor plumbing and urbanization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, intestinal parasite infections do still occur in the U.S., and many &lt;a href="http://www.ajtmh.org/view/journals/tpmd/90/5/article-p783.xml" target="_blank"&gt;disproportionately affect people with reduced access to health care&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7847297/" target="_blank"&gt;those living in poverty&lt;/a&gt; or immigrant communities. Some of these parasites like the microscopic &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cryptosporidium/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;cryptosporidium&lt;/a&gt; — usually transmitted through water or food that has been contaminated with feces, including &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2024/12/23/why-conservatives-are-now-obsessed-with-raw-milk/" target="_blank"&gt;raw milk&lt;/a&gt; — have become more common over the past decade, according to the review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have heard of some of the more common intestinal parasite infections. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pinworm/about/index.html"&gt;Pinworms&lt;/a&gt;, for example, cause itchiness in the anus and primarily spread between young children and their families, affecting &lt;a href="https://cchp.ucsf.edu/resources/illness-sheets/pinworms#:~:text=It%20is%20estimated%20that%20five,re%2Dinfect%20a%20treated%20child."&gt;up to 15% of the population&lt;/a&gt; at any given time. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/giardia/about/index.html"&gt;Giardia&lt;/a&gt;, which causes diarrhea and can be acquired from drinking water from streams that has been contaminated, is estimated to affect &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthy-water-data/documentation/giardiasis-nndss-summary-report-for-2019.html#:~:text=Figure%201.,%E2%80%932019%20(N%20=%20158%2C344)&amp;amp;text=Since%202011%2C%20the%20incidence%20of,confirmed%20and%203.4%25%20nonconfirmed)."&gt;3.7% of the U.S. population&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other intestinal parasites can have more severe side effects. &lt;em&gt;Ascaris lumbricoides, &lt;/em&gt;a type of roundworm from pigs that has been reported in a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25626125/" target="_blank"&gt;few cases&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38526329/" target="_blank"&gt;humans&lt;/a&gt;, can cause issues with the lungs or growth problems in children in severe cases. However, there are medicines available to eradicate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, intestinal parasite infections are far more common in developing countries, where deworming practices are sometimes performed on populations that are exposed to high levels of contamination that put them at risk. But that is not the case in the states, where exposure to raw sewage or other things that can transmit intestinal parasites are comparably low, said Dr. Carlos Chaccour, a tropical disease researcher at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the U.S., which is highly urbanized and there are laws for sanitation, waste management, etc., the prevalence is substantially low,” Chaccour told Salon in a phone interview. “It’s definitely not a public health problem.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finding out if you actually have a parasite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case that someone is infected with a parasite, it’s important to get tested to identify which one it is, as each one has its own treatment protocol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people online say the tests used to diagnose parasites are inaccurate and prone to false negatives. While it is true that some infections could be missed in a single sample, the CDC recommends testing stool three times. In one &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC85240/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; of refugees in the U.S., for example, the first stool sample detected 80% of cases, the second increased the sensitivity to 92% and the third detected the remaining cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, other techniques are available to detect parasitic infections like blood tests, which vary based on the test but are generally even more accurate. One 2014 &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24427320/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found many different versions of these tests accurately detected the parasites causing pinworm close to 100% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="left_quote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These cleansers often just encourage that. They irritate the stomach lining and encourage mucosal shedding, and to the untrained eye, it looks like a parasite."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Self-diagnosing parasites in your own stool can be tricky. For one, there are many different kinds that all look different, and evidence of parasitic infection can be excreted as parasitic larvae, which are microscopic. Some of the body’s natural processes can also mimic something that looks like an intestinal worm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, some of these supplements can change stool in a way that makes it look like a parasite is being shed when it isn't, said Chris Brianik, a biologist who moderates a Reddit group about parasites where people commonly discuss cleanses. The intestines shed their lining periodically, which produces a mucus that can be visible in stool and &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/rope-worm#intestinal-mucus-theory"&gt;may be misidentified as a parasite,&lt;/a&gt; he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In two published &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6791610/#s3"&gt;case reports,&lt;/a&gt; two patients took the herbal supplement &lt;em&gt;Mimosa pudica&lt;/em&gt;, which they had read online could “cleanse” gut parasites. However, the report concluded that “this substance clumps together in stool, causing long, stringy structures to form,” which made the patients think they were passing worms when they were not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These cleansers often just encourage that,” Brianik said. “They irritate the stomach lining and encourage mucosal shedding, and to the untrained eye, it looks like a parasite.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Savina Bertollini, an herbalist in Marche, Italy, said she has worked with health care providers to treat people who were infected with a parasite while traveling. While some herbs have been effective in her experience, these supplements can cause side effects when taken long-term and are not “miracle pills,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bertollini said she is skeptical of cleanses marketed for large numbers of people that are used in a “preventative” way without confirming that they have a parasite in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Someone might indeed need a parasite treatment,” Bertollini told Salon in an email. But for someone who does not know whether they have parasites and has not consulted with a health care professional, using a cleanse they bought because of an ad on social media or something similar "could create negative health consequences,” she added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supplements are not without risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the ingredients in things marketed as a parasite cleanse online may contain things like dietary fiber, which are unlikely to do harm, said Sebastian Lourido, a biology professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But if you are suffering from a real parasite infection, that is not going to help, and delaying treatment is probably going to be detrimental,” he told Salon in a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parasite cleanses contain a wide range of ingredients depending on the product, and much of the information about how these supplements impact the body is anecdotal. One small study found &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17472487/"&gt;dried papaya seeds were associated with reduced intestinal parasites&lt;/a&gt; in Nigerian children. But the majority of studies looking at the effects of herbal supplements like these on parasites have been &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37230485/"&gt;conducted in test tubes&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10392325/#s0002"&gt;culture dishes&lt;/a&gt; — not in humans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to herbal supplements, however, some cleanses include &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/topic/ivermectin" target="_blank"&gt;ivermectin&lt;/a&gt;, an antiparasitic drug used to treat river blindness and elephantitis, which leads to the painful enlargement of body parts. While ivermectin has saved millions of lives around the world from conditions like these, taking these drugs without having parasites or without a doctor to help guide dosing can be dangerous, Chaccour said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, ivermectin has been caught up in misinformation circulating online: During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, inaccurate claims that it cured the virus spread on social media, and many began using animal formulations in an attempt to treat &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/ivermectin-and-covid-19#:~:text=Here's%20What%20You%20Need%20to,against%20COVID%2019%20in%20humans." target="_blank"&gt;COVID&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/the-monitor/covid-vaccine-concerns-and-claims-about-ivermectin-as-cancer-treatment-the-monitor/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. Despite &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/31/well/ivermectin-cancer-covid.html"&gt;concerns of misuse&lt;/a&gt;, legislation allowing ivermectin to be sold over-the-counter instead of requiring a prescription has recently &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/24/health/ivermectin-infection-treatment-prevention-wellness"&gt;passed in Idaho, Tennessee and Arkansas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moore said ivermectin was not the panacea some are making it out to be and that it is not a benign drug in large quantities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All drugs have risks and benefits,” he said. “If you're taking any drug, regardless of what it is to treat something that you don't actually have, then you're taking all of the risk and you get none of the benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some substances in parasite cleanses may disrupt the microbiome: the balance of natural bacteria in the gut that &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41231-021-00091-4" target="_blank"&gt;helps digest food and keep the body healthy&lt;/a&gt;, Lourido said. Although scientists are still uncovering how the balance of bacteria in the microbiome impacts the body, upsetting this balance in the gut has been associated with changes to the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5695238/"&gt;immune and metabolic systems &lt;/a&gt;— and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10384867/"&gt;even mental health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many cleanses also recommend eating certain foods or restricting one’s diet, which could also disrupt this system. Alternatively, those dietary changes could also be behind some of the positive changes reported after a cleanse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you cause significant changes in the intestine, you are at times obliterating many of the beneficial organisms that are helping us digest food, but in some cases, producing vitamins that are actually occupying that niche and preventing bad organisms from taking over,” Lourido said. “All of those different functions … cease to occur correctly when we have diarrhea and we all of sudden make a dramatic change to eating only one kind of food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kurt’s cleanse contained black walnut, cloves and wormwood, along with a handful of other herbs. Most of the cleanse went by without him noticing any changes, but he started to have what he described as “a lot coming out of him in the bathroom” in the last week of it. Then, things took a dark turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extreme anxiety woke him up sweating in the middle of the night. His mental health changed for the worse, and he started to feel numb and anhedonic — things that used to make him happy no longer did. This went on for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At least a year or two after, I was in really bad shape,” Kurt said. “I was wondering if I was ever going to be the same person that I was prior to doing this cleanse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kurt is not entirely sure whether he had a parasite or not, or how the supplements interacted with his system. But he does think they caused a major shift. He was excreting things he had never seen in his stool before and feeling things he had never felt before. Looking back, he thinks he overdid it and that his body was not ready for the supplements he was taking. To him, it seemed like his reaction was not typical compared to what he had seen others report online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At the end of the day, there are a lot of herbs out there and they are very powerful," he said. “I suppose that I will never really get answers as to what really happened because unfortunately, I never really knew what I was dealing with prior to this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supplements are regulated for safety but not efficacy by the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, which is enforced by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This agency, along with the Federal Trade Commission, is in charge of monitoring companies to make sure what they're selling on the shelves matches what is being advertised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years after Kurt did his cleanse, the FDA sent a warning letter to the company that he bought it from, alleging the company mislabeled its supplements as medical treatments and did not contain enough information about the ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The problem with these parasitic cleansers is you don’t really know what is actually going on,” said Dr. Michael Schmidt, a microbiologist and immunologist at the MUSC Medical University of South Carolina. “In general, they come with ‘buyer beware’ attached.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The rise of the parasite cleanse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bertollini, the herbalist, said she has seen a “dramatic upswing” in the popularity of these sorts of products in recent years, but that much of it seems to be based on people’s “fear of having parasites.” This fear makes evolutionary sense: Parasites aren't technically predators, but they can cause serious harm as they leech off of their hosts. (On the other hand, some parasites &lt;a href="https://www.salon.com/2023/10/31/parasites-are-the-bedrock-of-life-and-the-unifiy-its-time-to-give-them-the-respect-they-deserve/" target="_blank"&gt;can actually be beneficial&lt;/a&gt; — it depends on the species and the relationship with its host.) In one &lt;a href="https://source.washu.edu/2012/02/study-extends-the-ecology-of-fear-to-fear-of-parasites/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, raccoons and squirrels would sacrifice food to avoid tick-infested areas, suggesting that they valued the threat of parasites more than the promise of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ancient, justified fear could be the root of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK541021/#:~:text=Epidemiology,Go%20to:"&gt;delusional parasitosis&lt;/a&gt;, a mental health condition in which people have psychological delusions that they have a parasite when they don't really. These folks may be particularly at risk of overconsuming cleansing products, Moore said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, many people are turning to online treatments for various conditions because of a growing mistrust in the medical system and a lack of access to health care. Although it has a far lower rate of parasitic disease than other countries, the &lt;a href="https://www.factmr.com/report/4496/detox-products-market#:~:text=What%20is%20Propelling%20the%20Demand%20for%20Detox%20Products%20in%20the%20United%20States?&amp;amp;text=The%20market%20in%20the%20United,detox%20products%20in%20the%20U.S."&gt;U.S. is the biggest buyer of detox products,&lt;/a&gt; including parasite cleanses. At the same time, one Gallup poll estimated that &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/658148/inability-pay-care-medicine-hits-new-high.aspx"&gt;11% of the population cannot afford or access health care&lt;/a&gt; as more people turn to online supplements in an attempt to treat their health problems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take people with conditions that notoriously lack treatments like Crohn’s disease or other inflammatory bowel disorders, which share some common symptoms with intestinal parasite infections. Of the estimated &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/crohns-disease/definition-facts" target="_blank"&gt;1 million people&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. with Crohn’s, &lt;a href="https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/patientsandcaregivers/What-is-crohns-disease/treatment#:~:text=Surgery,frequently%20recurs%20later%20in%20life."&gt;two-thirds will end up needing surgery&lt;/a&gt; because available medications are not enough to keep the progression of the disease at bay. Many may be trying these cleanses in an attempt to feel relief, Moore explained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’ll try a parasite cleanse not because they are convinced they have a parasite, but because they are reaching for something out of desperation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, more people might be thinking they are infected with parasites as mistrust also grows surrounding the environmental systems designed to protect our food and ecosystems from dangerous waste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some individuals have gone so far as to stop using &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/dining/raw-water-unfiltered.html"&gt;the water grid&lt;/a&gt; altogether, instead &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/us/raw-water-natural-springs.html"&gt;collecting water from natural streams&lt;/a&gt;. However, that might ironically &lt;em&gt;increase&lt;/em&gt; the risk of drinking water that is contaminated with parasites, if those streams are downriver from waste exposures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is a bit of truth in the sense that the U.S. has been somehow lax in terms of how much processing you allow for food and how much additional ingredients you have,” Chaccour said. “But that is not the same as going out to nature to collect your own water.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, the symptoms Kurt was experiencing after the cleanse faded away. In 2016, he started going to the gym, and his energy levels returned. His gut stopped bothering him, and he had what he describes as some of the best years of his life. Despite the reaction he had to the cleanse, he does feel that it helped him get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It's hard to say if it was the cleanse that helped me or was it ultimately going to the gym and being a lot more active, or a combination of both.” Kurt said. “Looking back, I could probably say that it was a positive decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Kurt has recently entered into another challenging part of his life. He is experiencing a range of new symptoms he thinks stem from an exposure to toxic mold. He has considered doing a parasite cleanse again, even though he doesn't think he has a parasite. On one hand, he feels it helped him 10 years ago and could have a similar effect again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“But I feel like, if that's not the case, I'm not really in a position to be able to deal with negative effects that might come from it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is burnt out from visiting doctors. In his search for more information on what could be causing his malaise, he finds it difficult to sort through what information online is real and what is bogus, he said. But the anecdotal experiences can only go so far, and what works for one person may not work for another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There's a lot of misinformation, but I do think there is a lot of good information out there, and it's just that it comes to a point when it's very difficult to separate which is which,” he said. “It’s certainly a gamble and I think it has its place. You just have to tread with caution.”&lt;/p&gt;

He now recommends them to everyone—to keep motivation flowing in good times and bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-block-book-your-workouts"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1. Block book your workouts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first move Claxton made was to establish an ironclad routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The first step I took was to schedule a workout in my diary first, before everything else. Basically, that comes down to making exercise a priority,” he tells &lt;em&gt;Fit&amp;amp;Well&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Locking it in first thing also minimized the number of life events that could get in the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I appreciate there are things in life that have to be more important, but you have to prioritize it,” says Claxton. “You have to decide where exercise fits in for you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Mi6v4mM4KMtXvcytpWHKKi" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-Mi6v4mM4KMtXvcytpWHKKi slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Putting this into practice, Claxton found a clear month in his diary and added recurring bookings for every workout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Train here, swim there, stretch here, and I haven’t touched it since,” says Claxton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s delivered the best results. My training isn’t even that different to what it looked like before, it's just consistent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claxton also ringfences each session to ensure he’s never in too much of a rush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I make sure I have time to eat after or a window to grab a coffee before,” he says. “I make sure there’s enough time to stretch if it's a more demanding session. That’s something I didn’t do before because I simply didn’t make it a priority.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-speak-it-into-existence"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2. Speak it into existence&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way that adding a workout into your diary helps motivation, is that it can help keep you accountable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you write something down, you're more likely to do it because you're writing it into existence,” says Claxton, pointing to an upcoming Saturday where he has blocked out 90 minutes for a HYROX training session and another 90 minutes for brunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A neat trick to double the dose of accountability is to speak it, as well as write it, into existence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If all week I’ve been telling my clients and colleagues that I’m doing a HYROX training session then grabbing brunch on Saturday, I'm committed. I can't then not train," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can apply this same logic to a workout, yoga session or even a full-blown race. Tell anyone who will listen, they’ll act as your personal accountability buddy and they’ll be none the wiser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-make-it-fun"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3 Make it fun &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, Claxton resolved to bring joy back to his training, an essential ingredient for anyone looking to make exercise a lifelong habit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’m often asked, ‘what’s the best exercise for X, Y and Z?’ The answer is always the exercise you are going to do again and again and again—consistently,” says Claxton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s the type of training that you will keep showing up to because you look forward to it. That’s better than doing a dozen workouts that you don’t enjoy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re struggling to find the type of training that you genuinely look forward to, Claxton recommends trial and error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re going fishing and you’ve got a bigger net, you're going to catch more fish,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So try a Spin class, have a go at a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/i-m-a-pilates-teacher-and-these-are-the-free-youtube-classes-i-swear-by" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/features/i-m-a-pilates-teacher-and-these-are-the-free-youtube-classes-i-swear-by"&gt;Pilates workout on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, or sign up for a free trial at your local yoga studio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are so many free apps and resources and taster classes you can sign up to,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you are a member of a gym, chatting to a personal trainer should help identify the style of training that’s more suited to your likes and dislikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spend any time in a yoga or Pilates class and your body will thank you. Both are mindful movement practices that connect breath with body, but each offers something unique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoga draws on thousands of years of wisdom to improve body and mind, while Pilates is a more modern system targeting deep stabilizing muscles, often overlooked in traditional strength training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if you could unite the best of both worlds? Former professional dancer Tina Traina has done exactly that. She created &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.davidlloyd.co.uk/exercise-classes/introducing-spirit/" target="_blank" data-url="https://blog.davidlloyd.co.uk/exercise-classes/introducing-spirit/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;SPIRIT&lt;/a&gt;, a yoga-Pilates fusion class at &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.davidlloyd.co.uk/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.davidlloyd.co.uk/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;David Lloyd Clubs&lt;/a&gt;, to build strength, alignment, mobility and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traina says everyone's training should strike a balance between building strength and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If I constantly train my chest and never stretch, it will start to get tight and lead to poor posture,” says Traina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you can’t ignore strength work either. “There needs to be enough strength in the body to support good posture,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might think you don’t have time to train both, but Traina specializes in maximizing your returns on the time you have to exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-pgEFQUTQJyNVtZc2DCt4e6" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-pgEFQUTQJyNVtZc2DCt4e6 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;These five bang-for-your-buck moves from her SPIRIT class strengthen your core and legs, support your training if you’re a runner, help improve full-body mobility, and help offset the strains and aches caused by a sedentary lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-five-yoga-and-pilates-exercises-for-strength-and-stability"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Five yoga and Pilates exercises for strength and stability &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-1-bridge"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.

It stretches the front of your body, especially the hip flexors and thighs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It also strengthens the back of the body, especially the glutes, hamstrings and lower back to help support good posture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’ll find this exercise in both yoga and Pilates."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-2-cat-cow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;2.

This drill is great for promoting good breath control which is very important for runners.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-3-side-lying-leg-lift"&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Side-lying leg lift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: svetikd / Getty Images)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reps: &lt;/strong&gt;15-20&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lie on your side, supporting your head with one hand and the other hand on the floor in front of you to help with balance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make sure your ankles, knees and hips are stacked one on top of the other.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lift your top leg slowly, then lower it with control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To make this exercise harder, lift your top leg, then lift the bottom leg to meet it, then slowly lower both to the start position. Because it’s a harder progression, reduce the number of reps to 5-10.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traina says:&lt;/strong&gt; “If you struggle with weak or unstable knees, this move will help strengthen the thigh and glute muscles while still promoting good posture and a strong core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s quite an unstable position, so use your other hand for support and focus on super slow movements.

When you do this, the body associates the act with being safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is also this phrase called the ‘knowing laugh,’” Matt noted. “It's when you share something that you think is quirky or unique to you and all of the sudden the room erupts because everyone else thought it was ‘just them’ who experienced that same thing. Here’s an &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/funny-shy-introverts-memes-69/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also got in touch with psychologist, psychotherapist and digital nomad &lt;a href="https://www.sonia-jaeger.com/en/" target="_blank" class=" staff-link"&gt;Dr. Sonia Jaeger&lt;/a&gt; to hear her thoughts on this topic. She agrees that humor can be a powerful coping tool when it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/freakshow-of-madness-mental-health-memes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;. “While it shouldn't replace professional support or minimize real struggles, finding humor in our experiences can offer a sense of relief, validation, and connection,” the therapist shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-7"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Memes, in particular, have a unique way of capturing complex emotions and experiences in a simple, often humorous format. They can make us feel less alone in our struggles and help us view our challenges from a different, sometimes more compassionate perspective,” Dr. Jaeger explained. “Laughing at a relatable meme can be a small but meaningful way to release tension and feel understood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-10"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt believes memes can certainly be useful in therapy. “I use them to help clients understand their diagnosis, describe a symptom we are treating or even a skill they can use to manage symptoms,” he shared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I've also had times where my clients, in trying to explain to me what they are going through, will say there is a meme they saw that relates to it,” the expert continued. “It sometimes even helped us get ‘unstuck’ with how to better verbalize and understand what the person is going through. And it started with sharing a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/gl9076/anyone_else_see_memes_and_think_itd_be_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;meme&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-12"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jaeger also says memes can definitely have a place in therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They can act as a bridge for communication—especially for clients who find it difficult to articulate their feelings,” she told Bored Panda. “Instead of saying, ‘I don’t know how I feel,’ a client might share a meme that perfectly captures their emotional state. This can spark productive discussions and offer the therapist valuable insight into the client’s inner world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-13"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to how to incorporate memes into therapy, Dr. Jaeger noted that there are several ways. “The therapist can bring in a selection of memes that touch on common mental health themes, letting clients choose ones that resonate with them,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the client can source memes as well. “Clients can bring memes they've found online that express how they’re feeling or what they’re going through.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-14"&gt;&lt;p&gt;And sometimes, therapists and their clients can work together to create memes. “This creative process can help externalize emotions and promote self-awareness in a non-threatening, humorous way,” Dr. Jaeger says. “When used thoughtfully, memes can help ease into difficult topics, build rapport, and encourage reflection in a way that feels approachable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-17"&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also asked the experts why it’s so important for people to feel comfortable discussing their mental health struggles, even if they need memes to do so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“‘A unicycle, car or horse… All that matters is getting there.’ Memes have become part of our world's language and how we communicate,” Matt says. “Millennials and Gen Alphas have and will continue to use this artform as a way to relate and connect with one another. Forming connections and normalizing the human experience is essential for someone's mental health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-18"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, take someone who is feeling depressed and they see &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/ridhigolechha/p/Cjn6SV0vMZj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" class=" staff-link"&gt;this meme&lt;/a&gt;,” Matt continued. “It is so funny and relatable that they decide to share it with a friend, loved one, or even their therapist.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now that feeling of sadness has also become a moment of connection, understanding and even laughter that is shared between people. The meme has become a conduit for that person to engage with their world where the moment before they may not have wanted to even be in it,” the therapist says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-20"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jaeger noted that it’s essential for people to feel safe and comfortable discussing their mental health because silence often leads to isolation, misunderstanding, and shame. “When someone can’t find the words to explain what they’re experiencing, they might shut down—or worse, believe they’re the only one feeling that way,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-21"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Memes can act as a first step toward opening up. They can normalize difficult feelings and remind people that others go through similar experiences,” she continued. “Sometimes, seeing a meme that ‘gets you’ can be more validating than hearing a clinical explanation. If it takes a meme to get someone talking about their anxiety, burnout, or ADHD symptoms, that’s still progress—and it’s incredibly valuable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-24"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Memes create a sense of Common Humanity,” Matt added. “Common Humanity is a central tenet of Mindful Self Compassion as a therapeutic intervention. And anytime we can feel that, it has been shown to lower cortisol (the stress hormone) levels and increase feelings of self compassion (which is a naturally occurring analgesic to suffering).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using humor can help us reach people who might not ever otherwise share their feelings with others,” he shared. “Therapy does not need to be a mystical process. We can take the topic of mental health very seriously while also not taking ourselves so seriously.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-26"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Dr. Jaeger added, “Memes might seem lighthearted or even silly on the surface, but they can play a surprisingly meaningful role in mental health awareness and therapy. They speak the language of the internet generation—accessible, relatable, and often brutally honest. When used creatively and intentionally, they can help people feel seen, spark helpful conversations, and even encourage self-reflection.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;div class="open-list-item open-list-block clearfix text-block "&gt; &lt;span id="list-text-27"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it’s worth keeping in mind that, while &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/hilarious-mental-health-memes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer " class=" staff-link"&gt;memes&lt;/a&gt; can point to shared experiences or even help someone recognize a pattern in their behavior, they don’t tell the full story. “They’re not diagnostic tools, and sometimes what resonates might just be a piece of a much more complex puzzle,” Dr. Jaeger told Bored Panda. “Used alongside—not in place of—professional support, memes can absolutely enrich the therapeutic process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/div&gt;                                                                                        &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Bored Panda</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 23:02:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE9wMVROMFM0a1AzdVhSSm5kZG1hRGN3aFI4Y0VyM2tJc0JHZGl3YjE4RThrZ2x0TTlwcDBsN0t5bTNMNjJZRHZVZTk5cFpJLTl3U3NZX2wwLVhiNTBxTy1vb245bU9SYzE4eDl5aUg1MWs</guid></item><item><title>服用维生素B有助于对抗青光眼，研究发现-每日邮报 | Taking vitamin B could help to fight glaucoma, study finds - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxOb0tYUWJaLURjRFdXZjJtMFNJam5iLU9tRk9CRy1UYkNpeVpTSVU5Ym5ZOE9PUExhUzVqQndZYnQ3ay1HQ1NPQ1BzcVhDcWZtSnpYR1Ytc05QX3VndU1tZWtIVk5RNUViNmNwcnh2TjlXeVEtM1E5Z2NOOFZpemRzWWRpZGdGN2tLNXV6ZjhyTS1EY0pOUVpJOGp0VkZyYm5ieFpQaEZB0gGrAUFVX3lxTFBTYnlsdHI4bk9OZndEQjVaR1hsbjhST2tHaFRvZ0JhdnlKdzBCcTdHRDNYRFI4WWFaREhMX2x6NVZOSXAtY1lRVzRoeW9lSVZtV3lUWU5mMTRDckFRQlQxdkNMQUN2eHJZeDh3d29qcUFVT0VTNUk5SkcwSWlOU3VENW8yM2ZJWmtNZ2F5Qmw5bDg4bXhHOUNzWmxJY3dfYzZvWUFYWFllcWhxNA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY — It's long been a goal in medicine to better understand the long trajectories of diseases in hopes of engaging in better prevention and early intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Collectively, they're (chronic and progressive diseases) responsible for about 90% of the health care costs in this country and the vast majority of morbidity and mortality," said Nina de Lacy, a professor of psychiatry and member of the One-U Responsible AI Initiative's executive committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, University of Utah researchers have taken a crucial step in doing so, unveiling a new, open-source software tool kit that uses artificial intelligence to predict whether individuals will develop progressive and chronic diseases years before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter RiskPath, a new technology that analyzes patterns in health data collected over multiple years to identify at-risk individuals with "unprecedented accuracy" of 85% to 99%, according to National Institute of Mental Health-sponsored research published last week by the U.'s Department of Psychiatry and Huntsman Mental Health Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program harnesses explainable AI, which is designed to explain complex decisions in ways humans can understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Explainability means, can I explain enough about how AI accomplished this prediction such that it becomes understandable to humans?" de Lacy said. "That would be things like what RiskPath does."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;De Lacy explained something that has always been a challenge in biomedicine is building models and analyzing longitudinal data, meaning it's collected over many time periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the major use cases in using longitudinal data is course development, understanding how people grow up and develop over time," de Lacy said. "And one of the other ones is what RiskPath is aimed at, which is understanding progressive or chronic disease. There are many progressive and chronic diseases out there, and some of the big ones are things that are the major diseases that affect humans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research shows current medical prediction systems for longitudinal data often miss the mark, correctly identifying at-risk patients only about half to three-quarters of the time. Unlike existing prediction systems for longitudinal data, RiskPath uses advanced time-series AI algorithms that deliver crucial insights into how risk factors interact and change in importance throughout the disease process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By identifying high-risk individuals before symptoms appear or early in the disease course and pinpointing which risk factors matter most at different life stages, we can develop more targeted and effective preventive strategies. Preventative health care is perhaps the most important aspect of health care right now, rather than only treating issues after they materialize," de Lacy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;De Lacy and the rest of the research team validated RiskPath across three major long-term patient cohorts involving thousands of participants to successfully predict eight different conditions, including depression, anxiety, ADHD, hypertension and metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology offers several key advantages:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced understanding of disease progression:&lt;/strong&gt; RiskPath can map how different risk factors change in importance over time, revealing critical windows for intervention. For example, the study showed how screen time and executive function become increasingly important risk contributors for ADHD as children approach adolescence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streamlined risk assessment:&lt;/strong&gt; Though RiskPath can analyze hundreds of health variables, researchers found that most conditions can be predicted with similar accuracy using just 10 key factors, making implementation more feasible in clinical settings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical risk visualization:&lt;/strong&gt; The system provides intuitive visualizations showing which time periods in a person's life contribute most to disease risk, helping researchers identify optimal times for preventive interventions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While RiskPath is primarily a research tool to help researchers build better risk stratification models, de Lacy hopes it will eventually be used in a health care setting to improve disease management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some may be using that to build models that can be implemented in health care, and we kind of hope that they do that. But ... a big part of what my lab is interested in doing is building tools that do a better job of risk stratification. We're very interested in prevention," de Lacy said. "The ultimate aim of RiskPath and tools like RiskPath is to help people build better risk stratification tools and decision support tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And what those do is help clinicians, and maybe one day patients, be able to understand their risk for a chronic or progressive disease better and earlier," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KSL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 21:04:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwgFBVV95cUxQdTlEWHBzVFJITmh2ZzNsUEVpU2hVRnIxX0xxOWtkNUdVYUk5aG1OUWJ1UF96N1lRQ1dxRVBIbWgzVzhaeHJOc2NEcDU1alN2T25oMjdJUW5JRnc3aUxHRmh4MjdqMlhvZFBhVWljQjVtdjIwWkJHdlpraDh3RDFlOW45V0hlMWhQRUVodC1hUFpiUmpFdEJDZEdySjFwWURneWtGZ3pvSTlCNEd3a1F6Y2ZqT19falFYTzhhelo5NmVrUQ</guid></item><item><title>盲牛成为孤儿小羊羔的妈妈，它正在融化每个人的心-雅虎 | Blind Cow Becomes Mom to an Orphaned Little Lamb and It's Melting Everybody's Hearts - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxPLXZXSWw5ZGprMTA5MnlfbGhObmJXbzhrNmRmaWNDVTNFZDdwV1B1Y1NZSUFmUFdMU2xnUkJKTjIzZVB3VkNyNjBUVS1LdlhiYTdoVjdscnFBUTJqdmxwZnNRWVN1T3ZQWlNnbEtqQ2FEUUNrazRDNFBNTlI1U3F4Mi1IVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Located in Williamsburg, Virginia, Life with Pigs Farm Sanctuary is home to all kinds of animals in need, not just pigs. Annie is a resident favorite there. She's a blind cow who is the epitome of gentleness, love, and kindness. So, it made perfect sense when an orphaned lamb named Huckleberry needed a friend that they'd probably be a perfect match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Turns out, they were! The farmers wanted to see how the two were doing alone together during the night, and what they found was just too cute! Huckleberry is a typical active toddler, and Annie is as patient as any mom we know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It seems &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/sleepy-lamb-cant-enough-good-130000593.html" data-ylk="slk:that sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;that sleep &lt;/a&gt;is the last thing on Huckleberry's mind - he's got &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/grouchy-turkey-hilariously-unimpressed-little-140000496.html" data-ylk="slk:energy to burn;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;energy to burn&lt;/a&gt;!

They're clearly a match made in heaven!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Commenters agreed as well. @jdbrodsky wasn't wrong when they shared, "It really takes someone special to put up with those kind of baby shenanigans." @gomez.michelle78 agreed, "Annie is enjoying Adventures in Babysitting…"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;@justmomma3 pointed out, "Annie’s like ok…&lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/golden-retriever-reaction-getting-head-171957774.html" data-ylk="slk:best massager;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;best massager&lt;/a&gt; and back scratcher ever!"

I was relieved to find out that Annie's blindness didn't come from neglect, abuse, an injury, or medical condition; she was born that way. The family to which she was born to was told by a vet that it was unlikely Annie would make it, but against the odds, &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/animal-sanctuary-sets-cow-carrot-130000416.html" data-ylk="slk:the sweet cow;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;the sweet cow&lt;/a&gt; survived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Life with Pigs also shared, "Annie also had a form of dwarfism that has resulted in her being quite &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/viral-video-mini-cows-bedtime-160000996.html" data-ylk="slk:tiny for a cow;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;tiny for a cow&lt;/a&gt;.  At a year old, she was not much more than a few hundred pounds.  She looks closer in size to a sheep than a cow." Maybe that's why Huckleberry was so drawn to her!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Sadly, something is going on with Annie. &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJcVD7jpQ64/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:In another video;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;In another video&lt;/a&gt; shared right after this one, you can see her cough a couple times and then suddenly fall over, while &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/pennsylvania-school-brings-tiny-lambs-140000253.html" data-ylk="slk:the sweet lamb;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;the sweet lamb&lt;/a&gt; runs to her side.
