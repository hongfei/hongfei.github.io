Previous experimental studies have shown that certain preservatives can damage cells and DNA, but firm evidence linking preservatives to type 2 diabetes or cancer risk remains scarce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In both studies, researchers set out to examine the association between exposure to preservatives and the risk of type 2 diabetes and cancer in adults, using diet and health data from 2009 to 2023. The findings were based on more than 100,000 French people enrolled in the NutriNet-Santé study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Beyond the effect of preservatives overall, 17 preservatives were analysed individually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the cancer study &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/392/bmj-2025-084917" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in the BMJ&lt;/a&gt;, of the 17 individually studied preservatives, 11 were not associated with cancer incidence, and no link was found between preservatives overall and cancer. However, higher consumers of several preservatives were associated with higher risk of cancers compared with non-consumers or lower consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;For example, potassium sorbate was associated with a 14% increased risk of overall cancer and a 26% increased risk of breast cancer, while sulfites were associated with a 12% increased risk of overall cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Sodium nitrite was associated with a 32% increased risk of prostate cancer, while potassium nitrate was associated with an increased risk of overall cancer (13%) and breast cancer (22%). Total acetates were associated with an increased risk of overall cancer (15%) and breast cancer (25%), while acetic acid was associated with a 12% increased risk of overall cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;While more studies are needed to better understand these potential risks, the researchers noted that several of these compounds could alter immune and inflammatory pathways, possibly triggering the development of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;This was an observational study, so no firm conclusions could be drawn about cause and effect. The researchers could also not rule out the possibility that other unmeasured factors may have influenced their results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;However, this was a large study based on detailed dietary records linked to food databases over 14 years and the results were consistent with existing experimental data suggesting adverse cancer-related effects of several of these compounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This study brings new insights for the future re-evaluation of the safety of these food additives by health agencies, considering the balance between benefit and risk for food preservation and cancer,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the meantime, they called on manufacturers to limit the use of unnecessary preservatives, and backed recommendations for consumers to eat fresh and minimally processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof William Gallagher, of University College Dublin, who was not involved with the study, said the findings had public health implications. “These higher rates of cancer are modest but are significant when taken at a population-based level in terms of potential impact,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;In the type 2 diabetes study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-67360-w" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, higher intake of preservatives overall, of non-antioxidant preservatives and of antioxidant additives was associated with increased incidence of type 2 diabetes, by 47%, 49% and 40% respectively, compared with the lowest levels of consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Of the 17 preservatives studied individually, higher consumption of 12 of them was associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This is the first study in the world on the links between preservative additives and the incidence of type 2 diabetes,” said Mathilde Touvier, a coordinator of the study. “Although the results need to be confirmed, they are consistent with experimental data suggesting the harmful effects of several of these compounds.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000"

about a fifth of their body weight - but once they quit they regain 0.8 kg every month, on average. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;That means they return to their pre-treatment weight in a year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"People buying these need to be aware of the risk of fast weight regain when the treatment ends," warns investigator Dr Susan Jebb, from Oxford University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She stressed that the findings come from medical trials rather than real life and more studies of the longer-term effects of new slimming jabs would be helpful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The researchers looked at 37 studies with over 9,000 patients to compare the blockbuster weight-loss jabs with conventional dieting or other pills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Only eight of the studies assessed treatment with the newer GLP-1 drugs, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, and the maximum follow-up period in these studies was a year after medication stopped, so the figures are an estimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;People who diet instead can expect to lose less weight than with the jabs, but afterwards weight creeps back on more slowly - perhaps around 0.1 kg a month - say the researchers, although it does vary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hNbOGD"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 gXmhTb"&gt;Risk of relapse&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The NHS recommends the jabs for people who are overweight with obesity-related health risks - not people who just want to get a bit slimmer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;And doctors should also prescribe lifestyle changes that include eating healthily and getting enough exercise to help people keep the weight off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Many say the treatment should be considered life-long, given the risk of relapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;People who have tried coming off the jabs describe it as "a switch that goes on and you're instantly starving". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;One woman said: "It was like something opened up in my mind and said: 'Eat everything, go on, you deserve it because you haven't eaten anything for so long.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Dr Adam Collins, an expert in nutrition at the University of Surrey, says the way the jabs work in the brain and body might explain why weight regain is amplified once you stop taking them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;They mimic a natural hormone called GLP-1, which regulates hunger. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"Artificially providing GLP-1 levels several times higher than normal over a long period may cause you to produce less of your own natural GLP-1, and may also make you less sensitive to its effects.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"That's not a problem when taking the drugs, but as soon as you withdraw this GLP-1 'fix', appetite is no longer kept in check and overeating is far more likely."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Going cold turkey is a real challenge, he says.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"This is further exacerbated if the individual in question has relied solely on GLP-1 to do the heavy lifting... artificially suppressing their appetite without them establishing any dietary or behavioural changes that would help them in the long run."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dPVOKT"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;According to &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://tracking.ucl.ac.uk/tracking/click?d=0CUGnalR16w9EgLB4OS6kCnsPnDHBMWCuGX5NRTm05GyHZr7O8moCoR1I7KzH2OK8apBLgf-McfyzS1tZl52AsHFHpyAo84EdFb0BPKB4Ov26HoG7ex5KIi-3sHX06J4XkDorjxhusCtdi4OP42IvSeAkMcsVKeOAzxVGcooglpc2e9TXJ7jF5S1s7QNjBhfojrTPNHqGrL9qSKPbZ7q_NI_bg3SVebFjuYJA3hwiDHvdUIWuig_akdlNx_5TQL5RNhR_ygkAEkc2wy7cxpzSaCOb05F_SNQ7YblH4Lec4xZW2sK4r6nxu1U_vG1w9J_HEw_7k1BxOikBxvo-FFXrq0b-D3ETc9hCKgpfASthEGu6woHDazC8ialGsB2jMXUwhd9acjZ0R-J8c478bpLd4fOvFdDLz_zVNVcNvTwnc9wdEklY2mjcF788m1ff-s3P66ha14ulxraS5v7ECTYEC9Pv_CTavsbRYzLtvUfr1e-ifZONB_vEMy2ZKg2_2KGn_EZa5buVQd_-omiLzzGMwu8EQa_vov2h6CC3GulZqzpDKeCSCl4BvLeg2xcy4Y9UupOsSzBRcJkFGzmTAJeWkN-2MwDqHhFF7_iq9g9kREzDMztGLEGFjgLDxHC4zz90PjFTGGVPOfY2Rax7tsr3ZOrHTKa4_Nras_4Alvh5lSallCy9pk9nsB9uLxvLn0EPnzPR44VX-cWkGbm4V4512wp6DPt63BDj4oA3RbI5i4Er_1VPf6qDPiKgvUyIXFDA4QrpCSJ1u1tVQXxQ4KhkWzbqcynwLJGSRzjK93neKwI4zuxJDG-VqfV7lf9-9aBfHoAdgiOyOegOKtSiDCxsV_aGVdOr1N6YTzFhCUlhUQC2xblkedjqdgDFsBa0neyqNBzm1EiSet3c7KLj_nRRYjYqCDGcWfRUuMlsAw04MmPVjSvk7T_7o21WV-B8XZ6uXz-72qUxyzDJ2-s1J4Ca3ebBOxGpdbX0QrLLypkPQkfIwp7RUlSEdYDtaOMl5f2ZXidOpyaWzLmAKvtl-8z7SoII0IHzHLx_lMAExfP0pWzeIx9NNjZ4h7fsL6xRlV3zw3ni1R0PDbC9g6tOK7z4vsV41lkV7wcKGRUFhDV3aMZAq-hRQ-dAZyICI1DHADByhHVCR9YrzIXVb1avi4V42amUSR_NrOhICQQxu7kBygn1wLLbt3Q8219I4MdTZsAAaONzPi-J0iGJr-hmCsCpscjXS2GIWUFHojwjPWFjsPi6CKxk3Ydo2QLoDuWuuJyzM3UAXN1EDAokZYwcVwRF6rTTuYDZL1gqCZIeS2usI8EAoyiZB065zHNsYm6L9wrU_XP61C23oXJYd0lrXxWM-6OR2xl1bTUm0dzf7kftkxQ0" class="sc-f9178328-0 iCaRzc"&gt;latest best estimates&lt;/a&gt;, around 1.6 million UK adults have used these injections in the past year -

                &lt;p&gt;A dose of the gym might do wonders for both an ailing body and mind. A report out today finds that exercise can provide similar benefits for depression as other widely used treatments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists in the UK reviewed the medical literature on exercise and depression, examining dozens of clinical trials. They found convincing evidence that exercise can reduce depression symptoms, at least in the short term, as well as evidence that its effects match that of therapy or antidepressants. Though more research is needed to fully quantify these benefits, exercise should be considered part of the toolbox used to help treat depression, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Exercise provides an option for people experiencing depressive symptoms, along with pharmacological treatments or psychological therapies,” lead study author Andrew Clegg, a professor at the University of Lancashire, told Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;An extensive analysis&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clegg and his team’s &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD004366.pub7"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; was conducted on behalf of the Cochrane Library, a British-based research organization known for its comprehensive reviews of clinical trial data related to important public health topics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They examined 73 randomized trials that collectively involved almost 5,000 adults with depression. Fifty-seven trials directly compared exercise to either no treatment or a control; ten trials compared exercise to therapy, and five compared exercise to antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;All in all, Clegg’s team determined that exercise is reliably better at reducing depression compared to no treatment, though this reduction is likely modest on average. That said, the long-term benefits of exercise for depression are less clear.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They also concluded there is “probably little to no difference in depressive symptoms” among people who regularly exercise compared to people taking therapy. The same seems to be true when comparing exercise to antidepressants, but the evidence there is less certain.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The team’s findings also suggest that light or moderate intensity exercise might be more effective for depression than vigorous exercise. And though no single form of exercise seemed to be substantially better than others, a mixed exercise program or resistance training might be better than aerobic exercise alone, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Remaining questions&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Cochrane review is the latest &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2815858"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; to indicate that exercise can reduce depression symptoms at least as well as other conventional treatments. But the authors say there are still important aspects that could be understood better with larger, higher-quality randomized trials.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If additional research were to be funded, it should consider which type of exercise is most effective in the long-term, how much exercise should be undertaken and for how long. Also, to look at who benefits from exercise, as it may benefit some people but not others,” explained Clegg.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Exercise is undoubtedly one of the best things you can do for your &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/study-less-10-000-steps-day-death-mortality-health-1850722379"&gt;overall health&lt;/a&gt;, however, and it’s likely to come with few side effects (the review noted that reported “adverse events” from exercise were uncommon). Some research has also suggested that combining exercise with other interventions like therapy can be &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/10/7/116#:~:text=The%20findings%20of%20this%20meta%2Danalysis%20provide%20support%20for%20the%20use%20of%20exercise%20as%20an%20effective%20adjunct%20treatment%20for%20depression%20across%20a%20range%20of%20comorbidities.%20Specifically%2C%20the%20addition%20of%20moderate%20intensity%20exercise%20to%20BT%20may%20yield%20superior%20improvements%20in%20depression%20symptoms"&gt;even more effective&lt;/a&gt; than either alone.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;People dealing with depression should ultimately be encouraged to pursue the treatments they’re most comfortable with, Clegg says. But that list of options can certainly seem to include exercise.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

Don't try to aim for the last week of October, because you're going to forget it, and before you know it, the flu will be here, and you're not vaccinated," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

            “These are very important findings for preservatives that are not only widely used in the French and European markets, but also in the United States,” said senior author Mathilde Touvier, principal investigator of the NutriNet-Santé study used to conduct the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggseo000g3b6pyj2eil8e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The NutriNet-Santé study, which began in 2009, compares over 170,000 participants’ web-based reports on diet and lifestyle with their medical data stored in the French national health care system.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “These are the two first studies in the world investigating the associations between exposure to these food additives and cancer and type 2 diabetes,” said Touvier, who is also the director of research at France’s National Institute of Health and Medical Research in Paris, “and so we must be very cautious about the message. Obviously, the results need to be confirmed.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Despite those caveats, “the concern raised about preservatives is one more reason among many to emphasize the personal and public health importance of fresh, whole, minimally processed foods, mostly plants,” Dr. David Katz said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The cancer study, published Wednesday&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/392/bmj-2025-084917" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The BMJ&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; journal, closely examined the impact of 58 preservatives on some 105,000 people who were free of cancer in 2009 and were followed for up to 14 years. Only those who completed frequent 24-hour, brand-specific food questionnaires were included. People who ate the most preservative-laced food were compared with those who ate the least.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggseo000l3b6p242aw4k8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers did a deep dive on 17 preservatives consumed by at least 10% of the participants and found 11 of those had no relationship with cancer. However, the six that were linked to cancer are considered GRAS, or “generally recognized as safe” in food by the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-and-gras-ingredients-information-consumers/understanding-how-fda-regulates-food-additives-and-gras-ingredients#:~:text=the%20FDA's%20review.-,Ingredients%20that%20are%20Generally%20Recognized%20as%20Safe%20(GRAS),the%20FDA's%20GRAS%20Notification%20Program." target="_blank"&gt;US Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;. Those include sodium nitrite, potassium nitrate, sorbates, potassium metabisulfite, acetates and acetic acid.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggseo000m3b6p3d5o0fjf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sodium nitrite, a chemical salt commonly used in processed meats such as bacon, ham and deli meats, was associated with a 32% increase in the risk of prostate cancer. It’s cousin, potassium nitrate, was associated with a 22% higher risk of breast cancer and a 13% increase in all cancers. The World Health Organization has long considered processed meat as a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-meat" target="_blank"&gt;carcinogen,&lt;/a&gt; with a direct link to colon cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggseo000n3b6pebo5wrfx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sorbates, especially potassium sorbate, were associated with a 26% higher risk for breast cancer and a 14% increase in all types of cancers. These water-soluble salts are used in wine, baked goods, cheeses and sauces to prevent molds, yeast and some bacteria.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggseo000o3b6ptsry8snw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Potassium metabisulfite, often used in winemaking and brewing, was associated with a 20% increase in breast cancer and 11% higher risk of all cancers, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep000p3b6p4ccgnu7b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Acetates, which come from natural fermentation and are used in foods such as meat, sauces, breads and cheese, were linked to a 25% higher risk of breast cancer and 15% increase in cancer in general. Acetic acid, the main ingredient in vinegar, was associated with a 12% increase in the risk of all cancers, the study found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep000q3b6pzmxqt6pu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other types of preservatives — antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E, plant extracts like rosemary and such synthetic preservatives as butylated hydroxyanisole — were also studied. While these more “natural” preservatives are often linked to lower cancer risk when eaten as whole foods, they may be harmful when used as additives, Touvier said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep000r3b6pmi56vrc0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The hypothesis here is when you isolate one substance from its original matrix of a whole fruit or vegetable, the action on our health can be different depending on the way our gut microbiota will digest it,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep000s3b6p8dweuz1t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Only two antioxidant preservatives were linked to cancer, the study found. Sodium erythorbate and other erythorbates, which are made from fermented sugars, were associated with a 21% higher incidence of breast cancer and 12% increase in cancer overall.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep000t3b6pzcyk14w3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Erythorbates are used to prevent discoloration and spoilage in poultry, soft drinks and baked goods, to name a few. Sodium erythorbate is often used in processed meats to speed up the curing process.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Observational studies are subject to error due to the lack of control over variables that might also influence outcomes. However, a major strength of this study was its ability to adjust for preservatives from natural sources and other food additives as well as its “detailed assessment of preservative intake, through repeated 24-hour dietary records,” according to an &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/392/bmj.r2613" target="_blank"&gt;editorial&lt;/a&gt; published with the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “We also looked at what colleagues have published on the impact of these preservative chemicals on animal models, cellular models, gut microbiota, oxidative stress and inflammatory processes which may explain what we observe,” Touvier said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep000w3b6pn82ujmq0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition, both studies controlled for such confounding factors as a physical activity, tobacco, alcohol use, medication use and lifestyle factors, Touvier said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep000x3b6pnm1z89w5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The finding that specific classes of preservatives are associated with increased risk of select cancers was robust to all of these adjustments, indicating it is a matter that warrants respect and requires further research,” Katz said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Type 2 diabetes and preservatives
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep000y3b6p0uhn3up2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The type 2 diabetes study, published Wednesday in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-67360-w" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, examined the role of preservatives and the potential risk of type 2 diabetes in nearly 109,000 of the NutriNet-Santé participants who did not have the disease at the start of the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep000z3b6pzjhn5bq7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Twelve of the 17 preservatives researchers examined were linked with nearly a 50% higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes in people who consumed the highest levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep00103b6pjdniwh5r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Five of the same preservatives that caused cancer — potassium sorbate, potassium metabisulfite, sodium nitrite, acetic acid and sodium acetate — also raised the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. In this case the probability rose by 49%, according to the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep00113b6phjo4r3x2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A sixth preservative — calcium propionate — was also connected. It’s a white powder used to stop mold and bacterial growth.&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep00123b6pwp5zuzav@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In this study on type 2 diabetes, more than two antioxidant additives increased risk. Additives that increased risk by 42% included alpha-tocopherol, the most bioavailable form of vitamin E; sodium ascorbate, which is a buffered form of vitamin C and sodium; rosemary extracts; sodium erythorbate, made from fermented sugar; phosphoric acid, a preservative in sodas, processed meats, cheeses and other foods; and citric acid, a flavor enhancer, preservative and pH adjuster with no significant nutritional value.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep00133b6p0vlwyldt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Since these two studies are the first to examine the role of preservatives in the development of cancer and type 2 diabetes, much more research will be required to confirm and expand the findings, said Anaïs Hasenböhler, the first author of both studies who is a doctoral student at the Nutritional Epidemiology Research Team at the Université Sorbonne Paris Nord.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ggsep00143b6pvhl4d4gl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, Hasenböhler added in a statement, “These new data add to others in favour of a reassessment of the regulations governing the general use of food additives by the food industry in order to improve consumer protection.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

New York state recorded 1,157 tests for canine flu through mid-December, but none has come back positive as of Dec. 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="17gll"&gt;And while dogs can’t catch the flu from people, or vice versa, it’s still important for pet owners to understand the risks, according to Dr. Katja Lang, chief medical officer at &lt;a href="https://heartofchelsea.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Heart of Chelsea Veterinary Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="6ges"&gt;“There is no relationship," Lang said. "Human flu, dog flu — both called influenza — but a human cannot give a dog flu, and a dog cannot give their flu to a human."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="7m4tr"&gt;Lang stressed that there’s currently no outbreak of dog flu in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="9nlho"&gt;She said symptoms of canine flu vary widely. Some dogs show no signs at all, while others develop coughing, nasal discharge, lethargy, decreased appetite or even pneumonia in severe cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="a06ql"&gt;“You can have a dog that has been exposed to the flu, that’s shedding and is contagious to other dogs and has zero symptoms,” she said. “That’s where it gets very tricky.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="74qi1"&gt;The virus spreads easily in crowded environments like shelters, kennels or dog day cares, especially when there’s poor air circulation. And while some brachycephalic breeds, like pugs and French bulldogs, may be more prone to respiratory illness in general, Lang said no specific breed is more likely to contract the flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="3c8pt"&gt;“It’s considered highly contagious and when there are outbreaks, it spreads very quickly,” Lang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="3ik89"&gt;Lang recommends the canine flu vaccine for dogs who frequently interact with other dogs, like those in parks, boarding facilities or grooming salons. The vaccine won’t necessarily prevent infection, but can reduce the severity of symptoms if a dog is exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="2uv4f"&gt;“It’s a very safe and effective vaccine,” Lang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="986is"&gt;Lang urges any owner who suspects their dog has the flu to call their vet first, rather than walking into a clinic, which could expose other pets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="a9a9j"&gt;“There is a test that can be easily run where we swab their throat or their eyes and we send it out to a lab to confirm that this is the flu," Lang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-block-key="cali7"&gt;The H3N2 canine influenza virus was first detected in South Korea in 2007 and has since been identified in dogs across Asia and North America, including in the U.S., &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-in-animals/about/canine-flu.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Gothamist</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 22:16:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxQand2SnEwWGpITEtjd2Z0VVcxN2RjTHpUdGxWYmkxWnFRWERiX0xDeFlCVXl5azFYdFpPTHBtelJGdms1MExOVW1oMmNERS1YNDJVZXdKRHN1OHE5VEx5dEgydXBQbzVTUXNscnhVN0ctb3VRRE5LemZXd2kxcFJxYk5vZ0hNSk9JcEFVWGs3eEZ5RHJscVE1VQ</guid></item><item><title>研究表明，血液中的咖啡因可能会影响身体脂肪和糖尿病风险- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/caffeine-in-your-blood-might-affect-body-fat-and-diabetes-risk-study-shows</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

Approximately half of the effect of caffeine on type 2 diabetes liability was estimated to be mediated through BMI reduction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary of the research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study involved data from just under 10,000 people collected from existing genetic databases, focusing on variations in or near specific genes known to be associated with the speed at which caffeine is broken down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, those with variations affecting the genes – namely &lt;a href="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=CYP1A2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CYP1A2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a gene that regulates it, called &lt;a href="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=AHR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AHR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – tend to break caffeine down more slowly, allowing it to remain in the blood longer. Yet they also tend to drink less caffeine in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An approach called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_randomization"&gt;Mendelian randomization&lt;/a&gt; was used to determine likely causal relationships between the presence of the variations, illnesses like diabetes, body mass, and lifestyle factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141100" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141100" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ThreeHandsHoldingCoffeeR_U_642.jpg" alt="Three coffees being held by hands" class="size-full wp-image-141100" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ThreeHandsHoldingCoffeeR_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ThreeHandsHoldingCoffeeR_U_642-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/ThreeHandsHoldingCoffeeR_U_642-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141100" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Caffeine in your blood may help determine your risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.

            Flu is making people miserable from coast to coast, thanks in large part to a new strain called subclade K.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4e9tej00042e6fuqauw48f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That’s why infectious disease experts are telling people to run, not walk, to get this season’s flu shot if they haven’t yet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4e9tej00052e6f98e0o68o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But you may be wondering whether getting a flu vaccine will still help or even if getting the vaccine might be riskier than getting sick. It &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; help, and the flu is far riskier — but misinformation about vaccines is almost as rampant as the germs they protect against, and it can be hard to know what to believe.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4e9tej00062e6fptygbukt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here are some of the most common myths about flu vaccines and what the science shows.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4e7izr00002e6f1qfoor81@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The reality is that people who get a flu shot are less likely to become severely ill, be hospitalized or die.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ebi1a000c2e6fc0i5k47w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In a &lt;a href="https://x.com/HHS_Jim/status/2008702124125831525" target="_blank"&gt;social media post&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday, Jim O’Neill, acting director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that a review by the US Department of Health and Human Services “found no randomized controlled trials demonstrating reduction of community transmission, hospitalizations, or mortality in children from the pediatric [flu] vaccine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eceqw000h2e6fa9pff8mr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He’s right, says Dr. Mark Loeb, a flu researcher at McMaster University in Ontario – but that’s because randomized controlled trials aren’t the right tool for measuring severe outcomes of the flu.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eceqw000i2e6f11r6bqd5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “For randomized controlled trials, most of them are underpowered to detect outcomes like even hospitalizations or deaths,” Loeb said, meaning they don’t have enough people in them to accurately detect differences in these outcomes, which are less common than infections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eceqw000j2e6fx04o63pq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Loeb &lt;a href="https://www.clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.org/article/S1198-743X(25)00474-4/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;published a meta-analysis&lt;/a&gt;, or study of studies, in October in the journal Clinical Microbiology and Infection that included 165 observational studies with “test-negative designs,” which look at all the people who are treated for the same set of symptoms in an emergency room or clinic and then compare the vaccination status of those who tested positive for the flu against those who tested negative.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eceqw000k2e6f91ghax3u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If a vaccine is effective, there will be fewer vaccinated people in the group that tests positive for the flu compared with those with the same symptoms who tested negative.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eceqw000l2e6fk13y7z43@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Test-negative studies are powerful because they eliminate an important type of bias in observational studies: that people who go to the doctor may be generally more concerned about their health and more likely to get vaccinated than those who don’t go to the doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4fy0no00013b6tvu6b9ebg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Together, the studies included more than 600,000 participants. They found that vaccines provide protection against severe flu complications at any age and regardless of how well the shots match the circulating flu strains.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eceqw000n2e6fywe37ux2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The analysis found that, on average, flu vaccines cut the risk of hospitalization or intensive care admission for children by about half and the risk of pneumonia by 70%. For adults up to 65, vaccination reduced the odds of hospitalization or pneumonia by 40%. Those over 65 saw a roughly 30% reduction in the risk of hospitalization, a 45% reduction in the risk of pneumonia and a 53% drop in the odds of needing intensive care.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eceqw000o2e6fqj5jeltk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think it is particularly important year for people to get a flu shot, given the increased severity of the [virus] that’s circulating, and our paper provides good proof for this,” Loeb said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ebw67000f2e6f1paxxi13@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The reality is that the current vaccine is still offering important protection.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ef429000t2e6flfx46rrd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s true that there’s a new flu virus going around and that it’s not included in this year’s shots. But that doesn’t seem to be affecting how well the vaccines work as much as scientists first feared it might.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eno9y000y2e6f420i7f28@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Subclade K is an A-type flu strain, specifically an H3N2 virus.&lt;br&gt;H3N2 strains change quickly and often bedevil the best efforts of scientists to choose strains to include in each year’s vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eno9y000z2e6fmxg4g4vd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That happened this year. After the three strains for this year’s shots were chosen, H3N2 began circulating in the Southern Hemisphere, driving a record flu season in Australia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eno9y00102e6fgwup3eyg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One big question has been how well this season’s flu shots protect against this new strain. Years when an H3N2 virus is the main driver of infections tend to have more severe disease, making answers about vaccine effectiveness even more urgent.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eno9y00112e6f7gipmbqa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s been mixed evidence on this point. World Health Organization scientists &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/influenza/who-influenza-recommendations/vcm-sh-2025/a.-26-september-2025-recommended-composition-of-influenza-virus-vaccines-for-use-in-the-2026-southern-hemisphere-influenza-season---full-report.pdf?sfvrsn=eba6ad63_5&amp;amp;download=true" target="_blank"&gt;reported in September&lt;/a&gt; that the blood of ferrets vaccinated with the current season’s shots didn’t neutralize subclade K viruses very effectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eno9y00122e6f2khh4k98@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In November, though, the United Kingdom’s Health Security Agency analyzed nearly 8,000 emergency room visits and hospitalizations &lt;a href="https://ukhsa-newsroom.prgloo.com/news/flu-vaccine-providing-important-protection-despite-new-subclade" target="_blank"&gt;and determined&lt;/a&gt; that this year’s flu shots were still surprisingly effective, despite subclade K mismatch. The vaccines cut the risk of kids needing to go to the emergency department or be hospitalized by about 75%. They reduced the same risks for adults by between 30% and 40%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eno9y00132e6fadknx4x7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, scientists at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine have weighed in. For a &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.01.05.26343449v1" target="_blank"&gt;preprint study&lt;/a&gt;,  published ahead of peer review, the research team took blood samples from 76 adults about a month after they’d gotten this year’s flu shot. They tested the serum, or the clear part of the blood, against several flu strains to see whether the antibodies in it could effectively recognize and bind to the viruses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eno9y00142e6f1r2kccvn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We were surprised to find that many individuals that were vaccinated with this year’s vaccine produced substantial amounts of antibodies that could effectively bind and neutralize subclade K viruses,” study author Dr. Scott Hensley said. His lab is part of the Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response, a network of flu researchers supported by the National Institutes of Health, and they do rapid work to get answers to urgent question about the flu. Hensley said his team worked through their Thanksgiving break to complete the experiments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eno9y00152e6fa3174894@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Before vaccination, only eight of the 76 study participants, or 11%, had neutralizing antibodies against subclade K viruses. After vaccination, 30 out of 76 people, or 39%, did.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eno9y00162e6fkv3x0qu7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The message is very clear here,” Hensley said. “In years when there are antigenic mismatches, as is the case this year, the vaccine can still provide protection.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eno9y00172e6fvxenm05u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whether or not a person made it into the group that developed antibodies against subclade K probably depends on what viruses they were exposed to in the past, Hensley said. So there’s no way of knowing whether you’d be in that group.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eno9y00182e6fjpsc6f3t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This isn’t perfect, but if you can decrease your chance of getting flu this year by fourfold, man, that’s a vaccine that I want,” Hensley said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4enlrw000w2e6few30z11b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The reality is that people may feel poorly shortly after the shot, but it’s not severe, and it’s not flu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4env8r001b2e6f1owawvl3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Plenty of people – about 1 in 3, according to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4467994/" target="_blank"&gt;some studies&lt;/a&gt; — feel bad for a day or two after they get a flu shot. The most common symptoms include headaches, muscle aches, fatigue and fever, all of which can feel an awful lot like the flu itself. But it’s not.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eppnb001i2e6fijkam4ay@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s biologically impossible,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. Because flu shots contain only pieces of the influenza virus, there’s no way these can cause an infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eppnb001j2e6fgwrvbrqr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Yes, we can get a sore arm that’s a little swollen, and some people may get a degree of fever and have a headache after receiving influenza vaccine, but that’s not the flu. That’s just your immune system responding to the vaccine that’s in the immediate period right after getting the vaccine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eppnb001k2e6f2whwsjd2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vaccines may use slightly different technology, but they all work according to the same basic principle: They show the immune system a piece of a virus or bacteria so it will recognize and respond to the real thing more quickly. Think of your adorable preschooler sneezing in your face as you tuck them into bed or the stranger in the subway who coughs a cloud of germs in your direction. A vaccine primes your immune system to spring into action quickly after you’re exposed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eppnb001l2e6f9ivx8fsz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the process of building that immunity, vaccines can trigger inflammation. One &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4467994/" target="_blank"&gt;small study&lt;/a&gt; that tracked symptoms in 56 women in the days after their flu shots found that most reported a sore arm. This was generally mild and resolved within a day or two.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eppnb001m2e6f6vlood9k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ten women reported bodywide symptoms like fatigue, headache or sore throat. Six women said their symptoms were gone after a day. Two had symptoms on the second day after vaccination, and one still had symptoms on the third day. Most described their symptoms as mild. Women who reported symptoms after their flu shot also had an increase in certain proteins in their blood that are markers for inflammation, leading the researchers to conclude that inflammation might be driving their symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eppnb001n2e6flfb86thx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The good news is that everyone in the study developed protective antibodies against the flu, whether they experienced symptoms or not.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4epnd7001g2e6fn4mhcykm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The reality is that you can still get the flu after vaccination, but the vaccine can protect from severe illness or death.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eqb39001s2e6fiau3aqhw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Studies show that flu vaccines do prevent some people from getting the flu, but in general, vaccines aren’t great at preventing respiratory infections, and it’s not really their main benefit. What they do best is prevent the worst consequences of flu infections: hospitalizations, pneumonia, heart attacks and death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eremo001x2e6fwnqdwxvo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s why: Vaccines create immunity all over your body in the form of Y-shaped scavengers called neutralizing antibodies.  These proteins have two outstretched arms that recognize specific places on flu viruses and latch on to block them from infecting cells. These antibodies live in your blood, the clear fluid that surrounds cells called lymph fluid, and in body tissues.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eremo001y2e6ffzta20zd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu viruses usually enter the body through the moist tissues – the mucosa – that line our nose and throat. That’s where the infection begins. To stop an infection completely, vaccines would need to create more of a different type of antibody, called IgA antibodies, that lives in these mucosal tissues and could block the viruses from getting a foothold there.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4gd50z00063b6tblu3tjxv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some vaccines — typically nasal sprays like FluMist — are designed specifically to create mucosal immunity. FluMist is one option for vaccination, and a good one for people who don’t like needles, but in general, injected vaccines have been shown to provide more consistent protection, especially for adults.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eremo001z2e6fflih26n3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Flu infections are typically mild when they get started. These early symptoms may feel awful, but they’re not nearly as serious as what happens days to weeks later if the infection moves into the lungs and turns into pneumonia or causes widespread inflammation, which increases the risk for &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03598-0" target="_blank"&gt;cardiovascular events&lt;/a&gt; like heart attacks and strokes. One study found the risk of a heart attack jumps sixfold in the week after a confirmed flu infection. Vaccination, on the other hand, cuts the risk of heart complications by 34% to 45%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4gdihu00083b6t7z4usoxj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors have also been &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2836871" target="_blank"&gt;seeing more&lt;/a&gt; of a rare but serious complication called acute necrotizing encephalopathy, which causes brain damage after the flu. These complications are far more common in people who were not vaccinated before they got sick.

            An &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa2514268?query=recirc_Semantic" target="_blank"&gt;updated evidence review&lt;/a&gt; looking at the effectiveness of vaccines against Covid-19, RSV and influenza, published in October in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that for children, flu vaccination cuts the risk of needing to see a doctor by about 55% and reduces the risk of hospitalization by 67%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eremo00212e6fi26tb8hc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “So vaccination basically eliminated about two-thirds of the hospitalizations that would have occurred without it,” said the study’s lead author, Dr. Jake Scott, an infectious disease expert at Stanford University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eremo00222e6fh7oxsinj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For adults through age 64, flu vaccines cut the risk of needing to see a doctor or being hospitalized with the flu by 49% and 48%, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eremo00232e6f8v8kwrmj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Seniors, 65 and older, had a 41% and 42% reduced risk of needing to see the doctor or being hospitalized with the flu, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eqs0s001v2e6f7hkzdezw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We can’t expect a shot that we get in our arm&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to put up this magic force&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;shield&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that blocks those respiratory viruses from entry in our nose, but they do prevent complications,” Scott said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4etfr900262e6f0g46crcr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The reality is that pediatricians still strongly recommend that most children get the flu vaccine every year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4euq1q002b2e6f2hdf5i0g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This week, HHS &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/05/health/childhood-vaccine-schedule-overhaul"&gt;pared back&lt;/a&gt; the number of vaccines routinely recommended for American children, saying the decision to get a flu vaccine should be made only after consultation with a health care provider. Vaccinations against rotavirus, Covid-19, hepatitis A and B and meningitis are also now in this “talk to your doctor” category. HHS says&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;these shots will still be covered by insurance if families want to get them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4evdb6002e2e6fx94vpvj7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pediatricians and infectious disease experts have responded, saying that putting the shots in this category only increases barriers to vaccination and may prevent kids from getting needed protection against dangerous germs. They say they’ve long had discussions with patients about the benefits and risks of vaccines before offering the shots, so this doesn’t really change what they do in their practice. Instead, they say, the change suggests that there are safety issues that aren’t being discussed before families vaccinate children. It casts doubt on the safety of vaccines, despite the fact that there’s no new evidence of increased risks that would suggest such enhanced discussion are warranted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ewbw4002j2e6f47dyylmh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some states and professional associations, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, say they are following the science and &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/34104/AAP-CDC-plan-to-remove-universal-childhood-vaccine?searchresult=1?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank"&gt;continue to recommend&lt;/a&gt; annual flu shots for kids 6 months and older.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4ewbw4002k2e6fyhyo7ged@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            During the last flu season, 280 children died of complications of the flu, a record for a non-pandemic year, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7436a2.htm" target="_blank"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the CDC. Of the children whose vaccine status was known, almost 90% of those who died were not fully vaccinated. Almost half who died had no underlying medical conditions before they got sick.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4eysan00362e6f5m3jisxm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The reality is that which flu shot you get depends on your age and your preferences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4evzlq002h2e6fzi81lf62@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Starting in 2022, the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended that people 65 and older get stronger types of flu vaccines: those made with either a higher dose of active ingredients or those that have an added ingredient, called an adjuvant, that boosts immune response. Those are brand-named Fluad, Flublok or Fluzone high-dose.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4exxx4002t2e6f643pewx3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Those three work better for older adults,” Schaffner said. “All of them provide about a 25% enhanced protection for people who are age 65 and older.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4exxx4002u2e6fopqvrwck@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Just as we physically become not as robust as we get older, such as when we were 22 years old and could run the hundred-yard dash very, very quickly, most of us can’t do that when we get older, so our immune system does not function as vigorously, and these three vaccines give an extra punch, if you will, to our immune system,” Schaffner said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4exxx4002v2e6f7abzdbeh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For people who prefer to avoid needles, especially young kids and non-pregnant adults ages 18 to 49, the nasal spray called FluMist also offers good protection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph_elevate" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmk4exxx4002w2e6fyd3ecekn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because FluMist contains a live but weakened form of the virus, it is not recommended for children younger than 2, adults 50 and older, pregnant women or those with immunity that’s been severely compromised by disease or immunosuppressive medications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Part of maximizing a long, healthy life—and making sure you can adventure outdoors long into your later years—is exercise. And if you’re exercising to live longer, just about every kind of workout (and every intensity) can help. That’s not hyperbole. Here’s just a smattering of the gobs of science on moving your body and dialing back your death date:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/56/13/755"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;British Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; found that “muscle strengthening” activities twice per week, performed for 30 total minutes per week, reduced all-cause mortality (science-speak for “early death”) by 10 to 17 percent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32520868/"&gt;2020 study&lt;/a&gt; looking at information from 26,000 Americans found a correlation between walking, stretching, aerobics, stair climbing, weight lifting, and volleyball reduced the risk of death between 7 and 12 percent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When scientists followed almost half a million adults for 8 years, &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21846575/"&gt;they found&lt;/a&gt; that just 13 minutes of daily exercise reduced people’s risk of death by 14 percent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adults with higher levels of strength in a &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003999318300790"&gt;knee extension test&lt;/a&gt; had a 14 percent lower risk of death compared to weaker adults.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(18)30538-X/abstract"&gt;A study looking at 23 years of data&lt;/a&gt; found that playing tennis regularly added almost 10 years to a person’s lifespan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And, of course, there are steps: walking &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/japanese-walking/"&gt;7,000 steps per day&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(25)00164-1/fulltext"&gt;is associated with&lt;/a&gt; a 47 percent lower risk of all-cause mortality compared to taking just 2,000 steps per day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest, greatest finding is that the biggest longevity lever you can pull in the gym is intensity, says &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.sharmanultra.com/coaches/mattlaye"&gt;Matt Laye,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a physiologist and ultra running coach with Sharman Ultra Coaching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have all these recommendations that are based on moderate to vigorous activity, and we typically think that one minute of vigorous activity is worth two minutes of moderate,” he says. But &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63475-2"&gt;a new study, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in October, says vigorous activity is even more valuable than that. “When it comes to mortality outcomes, one minute of vigorous [exercise] is worth four to nine minutes of moderate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strength, overall movement, and high-intensity efforts—these are the ingredients for a long-life exercise stew, Laye says. If you’re looking for a manageable longevity workout plan to get all these in each week, he says, focus on three things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1"&gt;The Three Ingredients You Need for a Longevity Workout Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ingredient 1: Two Days of Strength Training, Hard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not an acolyte of iron, you may just go through the motions when strength training, Laye says. Doing the same weight for the same number of repetitions in the long term won’t help with longevity. It just wastes your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, try to take each set of each exercise until you could only do one or two more repetitions before failing. This method, called “reps in reserve,” &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://sportrxiv.org/index.php/server/preprint/view/484"&gt;has been shown&lt;/a&gt; to be almost as effective as going all the way until you fail at the exercise, but it’s less unpleasant and easier to recover from. Doing all of your sets this way, and trying to increase your weight and reps over time while continuing to shoot for two reps in reserve, can help you gain strength and reap the gym’s longevity benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ingredient 2: Two Days of Breathing Hard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is your vigorous activity. But what does “vigorous” mean? In some algorithms, it’s walking (or jogging) at 130 steps per minute. In others, it’s activity that puts your &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/running/training/science/how-to-dial-in-your-personalized-heart-rate-zones/"&gt;heart rate in Zone 4 or Zone 5&lt;/a&gt;, rates that are basically just “really high.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laye suggests using a rate of perceived exertion (literally, how hard something feels), or RPE, of 9 or 10 out of 10. At this level, he says, you could say a word or two while doing the activity (but probably wouldn’t want to).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to work on this for long periods of time. &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63475-2"&gt;Studies have found&lt;/a&gt; that just a few minutes of this level of vigorous movement can make a big difference. In the workout below, one of the vigorous sessions only has you working for 7.5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ingredient 3: Lots of Steps, with at Least One Bout of 15 Minutes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vigorous movements give lots of bang for the buck, but low-intensity steps still add up. The National Institutes of Health &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/higher-daily-step-count-linked-lower-all-cause-mortality"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that taking 8,000 per day can cut your risk of early death in half. Taking one walk per day that’s 15 minutes or longer &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/journal-scans/2025/11/05/14/44/one-long-daily-walk"&gt;has been shown&lt;/a&gt; to have the most potent effects on cheating death—and if you go for that &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/wellness/fart-walks/"&gt;walk 10 to 15 minutes after eating a meal&lt;/a&gt;, it &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11053955/#sec6-nutrients-16-01170"&gt;can provide bonus benefits&lt;/a&gt; for your insulin sensitivity, fighting off type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laye’s got one more suggestion for your walks: to help maintain agility and keep you from getting frail (and eventually falling), make sure one of your weekly walks is on an uneven surface, like a trail. This, he says, can keep your feet and ankles nimble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Laye’s help, we’ve built a week of workouts that mixes all these ingredients together into a four-day-per-week longevity workout plan that takes around 30 minutes per session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2"&gt;Your Weekly Longevity Workout Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this plan, you’ll perform two strength workouts and two vigorous cardio sessions—one that’s &lt;em&gt;cardio&lt;/em&gt; cardio, and the other as a power-building exercise circuit that keeps your heart pumping while strength training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do the workouts in any order you want. But rest at least one day between strength sessions, and one day between the vigorous sessions. Your schedule might look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday:&lt;/strong&gt; Strength 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday:&lt;/strong&gt; Vigorous Cardio 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday:&lt;/strong&gt; Rest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thursday:&lt;/strong&gt; Strength 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friday:&lt;/strong&gt; Vigorous Cardio 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every other day of the week, get your steps: aim for 8,000 per day, with at least one bout lasting 15 minutes or more. For extra credit (and extra agility), try to do at least one of those sessions &lt;a target="_self" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/hiking-and-backpacking/americas-best-high-mileage-day-hikes/"&gt;on a trail or uneven surface&lt;/a&gt; each week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3"&gt;Strength Workout 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this workout (and in strength workout 2), you’ll choose exercises from a series of categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing Exercise:&lt;/strong&gt; this could be a &lt;a target="_self" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/types-of-pushups/"&gt;push-up&lt;/a&gt;, dumbbell or barbell &lt;a target="_self" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/resistance-band-arm-workout/"&gt;bench press&lt;/a&gt;, incline bench press, overhead dumbbell press, military press, or any other “push” move (instructions for these exercises can be found at the bottom of the page).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pulling Exercise:&lt;/strong&gt; this could be &lt;a target="_self" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/pull-up-beginner-exercises/"&gt;pull-ups&lt;/a&gt;, dumbbell or barbell rows, a cable or other row machine, lat pulldowns, or any other “pull” move.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leg Exercises:&lt;/strong&gt; choose a &lt;a target="_self" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/running/training/workouts/3-single-leg-squat-variations-for-runners/"&gt;squat variation&lt;/a&gt;, like a goblet squat or barbell squat, a deadlift, like a Romanian deadlift or &lt;a target="_self" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/running/training/workouts/how-to-execute-a-proper-single-leg-romanian-deadlift/"&gt;single-leg deadlift&lt;/a&gt;, the leg press machine, a &lt;a target="_self" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/how-do-lunge/"&gt;lunge&lt;/a&gt;, step-up, or any other leg move. Pick two.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessory Exercises:&lt;/strong&gt; These can be just about anything else. Choose an abdominal move like a plank or hanging leg raise, arm or shoulder moves like curls or lateral raises, or any other moves you’d like to incorporate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before starting this workout, warm up: pick a cardio method of your choice and go for 5 to 10 minutes to get your heart rate moving. Then, during the workout, perform a warm-up set of each exercise with a lighter weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After your warm-up, perform four sets of each exercise you’ve chosen. In each set, aim for 8 to 12 reps, finishing when you feel like you could only do one or two more repetitions. If that’s too easy at your current weight, increase the weight (or, in the case of bodyweight exercises like push-ups, keep going).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sample Strength Workout&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Push:&lt;/strong&gt; Dumbbell Bench Press&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pull:&lt;/strong&gt; Lat Pulldown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leg 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Goblet Squat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leg 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessory 1:&lt;/strong&gt; Hanging Leg Raise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessory 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Biceps Curl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Vigorous Cardio 1: VO2 Max Countdown&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/vo2-max-brain/"&gt;You might have heard of your VO2 max&lt;/a&gt;. It’s basically the hardest you can work while your body can still deliver oxygen to your muscles to make more muscular fuel. Raising this max capacity for effort can make you live longer: For every unit of VO2 max you go up, &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109718353786?via%3Dihub"&gt;45 days are added to your expected lifespan&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To bump it up, you’ve got to work at or near this level—working at a 9 or a 10 out of 10, even just for short bursts. In this workout, you’ll choose a cardio modality of your choice, like a bike, rowing machine, jump rope, or other for of heart-pumping work, and go as hard as you can muster for the prescribed period. When you’ve finished, you’ll rest until your heart rate comes back near normal, a level coaches call “composed, but not completely rested.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the good news: each effort gets shorter, which is why the workout’s called a “countdown.” Try to go a little harder on each shorter effort. How to do it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After warming up, go as hard as you can maintain for 3 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rest until you’re composed. This can be as long as the effort, or even longer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go for 2 minutes, then rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go for 90 seconds, then rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go for 1 minute, then rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go for 30 seconds. You’re done!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Strength Workout 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same format, different exercises. For each category, choose an exercise that’s slightly different than what you used in Strength Workout 1. So if you did a dumbbell bench press for your “push,” maybe do an overhead dumbbell press. If you chose a lat pulldown for your “pull,” try a horizontal seated cable row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then do the same thing: After your warm-up, perform four sets of each exercise you’ve chosen. In each set, aim for 8 to 12 reps, finishing when you feel like you could only do one or two more repetitions. If that’s too easy at your current weight, increase the weight (or, in the case of bodyweight exercises like push-ups, keep going).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Vigorous Cardio 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For vigorous session number two, we’ll do a strength circuit that gets the heart pumping and also moves weights fast. When you do that, you &lt;a target="_self" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/aging-athletes-power-research/"&gt;build muscular power&lt;/a&gt;, a measure of not just how much force you can create, but how quickly you can create that force. &lt;a target="_blank" class="text-brand-primary underline hover:text-brand-primary/85 break-words overflow-wrap-anywhere underline-offset-[3px]" rel="noopener" data-afl-p="0" href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(25)00100-4/abstract"&gt;Muscle power is a better predictor of longevity&lt;/a&gt; than absolute strength. In this workout, build it by aiming to move the weights (and your body) fast, creating force quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exercises:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kettlebell Swing or Dumbbell Swing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push-Up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squat of choice (like a Goblet Squat)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bent-Over Dumbbell or Kettlebell Row&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step-Up or Lunge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to do Vigorous Cardio Workout 2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform one set of 10 to 15 repetitions of each move, going from one exercise to the next with minimal rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you’ve finished all five exercises, rest for one minute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue in this way for 20 to 30 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4"&gt;Exercises for the Longevity Workout Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of this plan is that you can mix and match all types of pushing, pulling, leg, and accessory exercises. But if you’re not sure where to start, here are some great building block moves and how to do them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pushing Exercises&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Push-Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_2728378" class="pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone"&gt;&lt;img alt="main with dark hair and a beard does a push-up on the floor at a gym as part of a longevity workout plan" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2728378" srcset="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Pushup_Front-450.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover 1x" src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Pushup_Front-450.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assume a classic push-up position, with hands directly beneath your shoulders, your body forming a straight line from head to heels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain this rigid body line as you bend your elbows to lower your chest toward the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press back to start, maintaining the straight body line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dumbbell Bench Press&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_2728395" class="pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone"&gt;&lt;img alt="main with dark hair and a beard does a dumbbell bench press as part of a longevity workout plan" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2728395" srcset="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Flat-Dumbbell-Bench_900.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover 1x" src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Flat-Dumbbell-Bench_900.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lie face-up on a bench and hold dumbbells over your chest with an overhand grip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend your elbows to lower the weights to the sides of your chest. Your elbows should stay close to your sides, forming a 45-degree angle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pause for a beat, then press back to start.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dumbbell Shoulder Press&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_2728422" class="pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone"&gt;&lt;img alt="main with dark hair and a beard wearing a blue shirt presses two dumbbells above his shoulders" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2728422" srcset="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Overhead-Press_450.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover 1x" src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Overhead-Press_450.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, and brace your core and squeeze your butt. Bring the dumbbells up to your shoulders, palms in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintaining an upright posture, press the dumbbells overhead until your elbows are almost straight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return the weights to your shoulders, and repeat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Pulling Exercises&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resistance Band–Assisted Pull-Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_2728423" class="pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone"&gt;&lt;img alt="from behind, a man with dark hair wearing a blue shirt and black shorts does a pull-up on a pull-up bar" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2728423" srcset="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Pullup-with-Band_Behind_Take-30.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover 1x" src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Pullup-with-Band_Behind_Take-30.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tie a looped resistance band in between the handles of a pull-up bar so that it hangs down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Place one foot inside the band and grip the bar with an overhand or underhand grip, with your hands about shoulder-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before you start the move, pretend you’ve got jeans on: Imagine tucking your shoulder blades into the back pockets of your jeans. This can help keep your shoulders back and down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pull your breastbone toward the bar by bending your elbows. To help engage your back, concentrate on bringing your elbows down to touch your lats instead of thinking about bringing your chin over the bar. This can help you keep from reaching your head forward, which can cause neck strain, and can keep you from rolling your shoulders forward or back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowly return to the start position, and repeat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dumbbell &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bent-Over Row&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_2728425" class="pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone"&gt;&lt;img alt="a man with dark hair wearing a blue shirt and black shorts does bent-over row with one dumbbell in each hand" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2728425" srcset="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bent-Over-Dumbbell-Row_90_Take-20.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover 1x" src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bent-Over-Dumbbell-Row_90_Take-20.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold one dumbbell in each hand with a neutral grip (palms pacing in), feet hip-width apart, knees slightly bent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push your hips back like you’re opening a door behind you with your butt. This starts the hip hinge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep pushing your hips back so that your back remains flat until it is nearly parallel to the floor with the weight hanging straight down from your shoulders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintaining this flat back position, pull the weights toward your chest, bending at your elbow and keeping your upper arms in line with your back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower the weights back to the starting position, and repeat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lat Pull-Down&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_2728426" class="pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone"&gt;&lt;img alt="a man with dark hair wearing a blue shirt and black shorts does a lat pull-down as part of a longevity workout plan" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2728426" srcset="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Lat-Pull_High-45_Take-2.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover 1x" src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Lat-Pull_High-45_Take-2.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit in the lat pull-down machine (a cable machine with a bar attachment would also work great for this) with your feet flat on the floor and an upright torso. Reach up and grab the handle with an overhand grip, arms slightly wider than shoulder-width. Tuck your shoulder blades back and down, imagining you’re tucking them into the back pockets of a pair of jeans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping a proud chest, bend your elbows to pull the bar down until it touches your breast bone, just below your collar bones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control the weight to return to start. Repeat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Leg Exercises&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Goblet Squat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_2728428" class="pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone"&gt;&lt;img alt="a man with dark hair wearing a blue shirt and black shorts does a goblet squat in a gym holding a weight at his chest" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2728428" srcset="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Goblet-Squat_450.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover 1x" src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Goblet-Squat_450.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand with your feet hip-width apart, toes pointed slightly out from parallel. Cup one end of a dumbbell in both hands in front of your chest with your elbows pointing down—in this position, the dumbbell and your arms will look like a goblet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push your hips back to initiate the squat. Bend your knees to descend until your thighs are at least parallel to the floor, keeping your chest up and your weight on your heels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep the weight of your body in your heels and press back to standing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forward Lunge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_2728430" class="pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone"&gt;&lt;img alt="a man with dark hair wearing a blue shirt and black shorts does a lunge in a gym" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2728430" srcset="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Forward-Lunge_45_Take-20.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover 1x" src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Forward-Lunge_45_Take-20.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a large lunge step forward with your right leg, descending as you step until your knees both form 90-degree angles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your right foot to stand back up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you finish all the reps on your right side, do an equal number on your left side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="standard-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tip: If you feel like lunging forward is too challenging on your balance, try reverse lunging, where you step back into the lunge instead of forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step-Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_2728431" class="pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone"&gt;&lt;img alt="a man with dark hair wearing a blue shirt and black shorts demonstrates how to do a weighted step-up on a bench" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2728431" srcset="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Stepup_45.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover 1x" src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Stepup_45.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand with a bench or other sturdy surface in front of you, dumbbells at your sides, palms in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your torso upright as you place your right foot on the bench and press through your heel to bring your left foot up so you’re standing on the bench.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return to the ground under control. Do all your reps on this side before switching sides and repeating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-Leg RDL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_2728432" class="pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone"&gt;&lt;img alt="as part of a longevity workout plan, a man with dark hair wearing a blue shirt and black shorts demonstrates how to do a single-leg romanian deadlift (RDL)" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2728432" srcset="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Single-Leg-RDL_45.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover 1x" src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Single-Leg-RDL_45.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand on your right leg while holding one dumbbell in each hand, at arm’s length at your sides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping your right knee slightly bent, perform the deadlift by bending at the hip, extending your left leg behind you for balance. During this movement, make sure your hips remain square: both hip bones point forward and to the floor the entire time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue lowering the dumbbells until your upper body is parallel to the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping your back flat, return to the upright position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat on the opposite side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Accessory and Circuit Exercises&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dumbbell Biceps Curl&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_2728434" class="pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone"&gt;&lt;img alt="as part of a longevity workout plan, a man with dark hair wearing a blue shirt and black shorts demonstrates how to do biceps curls with a dumbbell" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2728434" srcset="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Dumbbell-Curl_45.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover 1x" src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Dumbbell-Curl_45.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand holding dumbbells at your sides, palms in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squeeze your butt, pull your shoulders back, and flex your triceps. This will keep you from thrusting with your hips.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Now, maintaining an upright torso, bend your elbows to lift your hands up to your shoulders, your palms facing the cap of your shoulder. Squeeze your bicep at the top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower your arms and repeat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forearm Plank&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_2728600" class="pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone"&gt;&lt;img alt="a man with dark hair wearing a blue shirt and black shorts demonstrates how to do a forearm plank for longevity" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2728600" srcset="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Forearm-Plank_45.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover 1x" src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Forearm-Plank_45.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Assume a forearm plank position, with your elbows directly beneath your shoulders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Form a straight body line from head to heels, squeezing all over.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain this position for the time prescribed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hanging Leg Raise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_2728601" class="pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone"&gt;&lt;img alt="a man with dark hair wearing a blue shirt and black shorts performs a hanging leg raise at a gym" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2728601" srcset="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Hanging-Leg-Raise_Front.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover 1x" src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Hanging-Leg-Raise_Front.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hang at arm’s length from a pull-up bar with an overhand or neutral grip.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set your core, and then use your abs—not your back—to raise your legs straight in front of you. If this is too hard, bend your knees and lift them up towards your waist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Control your legs back down, and repeat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kettlebell Swing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand holding the handle of a kettlebell with both hands, using an overhand grip. The bell should hang down between your legs. Set your feet a little wider than shoulder-width, and soften your knees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintaining a flat back, push your hips back to drop the weight between your legs. Note: this is a hip hinge-and-drive exercise, not an arm exercise, so don’t focus on using your shoulders to swing the weight back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forcefully thrust your hips forward to return to standing so that the bell swings up in front of you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As it swings back down, hinge forward again so the weight goes between your legs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thrust your hips forward again, and keep swinging for the prescribed time or reps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bent-Over Single-Arm Kettlebell Row&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_2728603" class="pom-image-wrap photo-alignnone"&gt;&lt;img alt="a man with dark hair wearing a blue shirt and black shorts demonstrates a bent-over kettlebell row" loading="lazy" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2728603" srcset="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bent-Over-Kettlebell-Row_90.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover 1x" src="https://cdn.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bent-Over-Kettlebell-Row_90.jpg?width=3840&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;quality=75&amp;amp;fit=cover"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stand with a firm bench (or coffee table or other sturdy piece of furniture) on your left side. Place your left knee on the bench, then bend your torso forward and place your left hand on the bench to support your body. In this position, your upper body should be parallel to the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reach down and grab the kettlebell with your right hand, returning to this position where your body is parallel to the floor, with the weight hanging straight down from your right shoulder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintaining that upper body position, pull your right arm straight up until your hand reaches the side of your chest. Lower the weight back to the starting position, and repeat. Do all your reps on this side, then switch sides and repeat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="standard-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tip: &lt;/strong&gt;If you’re feeling strong and well-balanced, you can skip using the bench and try this with both feet on the floor, as shown in the photo above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The strain emerged last summer, too late for it to be included in the 2025-2026 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-db51aa" class="body-graf"&gt;“This is unexpected good news,” said Scott Hensley, professor of microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania. “Although it’s not a complete match with what’s circulating, this vaccine appears to have the capacity to produce antibodies that will likely provide protection,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6a5bb7" class="body-graf"&gt;The Penn Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Response takes an early look every year at how well the seasonal flu shot prompts an antibody response in the immune system. That is, how likely the shot is to offer measurable protection for most people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1857c9" class="body-graf"&gt;This year's findings were &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.64898/2026.01.05.26343449v1" target="_blank"&gt;released Tuesday night&lt;/a&gt; on the preprint server medRxiv, a site that publishes research before it’s gone through an extensive and rigorous peer-review process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f28e2a" class="body-graf"&gt;The&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;current flu shot protects against three flu strains: two A strains (H1N1 and H3N2) and one B strain. Last June, however, after vaccine production had begun, H3N2 changed slightly. This raised concerns that the shots would be a poor match. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-82454a" class="body-graf"&gt;In October and November, the researchers analyzed blood samples taken from 76 people, ages 24 to 81. One blood draw occurred just before they got the flu shot. A second sample was taken about a month later, giving the vaccine ample time to mount a defense against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-251e04" class="body-graf"&gt;Before getting the shot, 39% of the study participants had antibodies against H3N2, likely because they’d already been exposed to the virus. That percentage nearly doubled after the vaccine, to 71%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7df6e0" class="body-graf"&gt;The effect was even more striking when researchers looked specifically at how the shot worked against the shifted H3N2 strain, subclade K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-ffa22a" class="body-graf"&gt;Before the shot, just 11% had antibodies against subclade K. That percentage nearly quadrupled after the shot, to 39%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0c8bc5" class="body-graf"&gt;The results held regardless of the study participants’ ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2445c0" class="body-graf"&gt;Doctor visits for flu-like symptoms have hit the highest levels for this time of year in nearly three decades. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-52.html" target="_blank"&gt;latest data&lt;/a&gt; from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 1 in 10 outpatient doctors’ visits were for flu symptoms as of Dec. 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-745c88" class="body-graf"&gt;Although people who are vaccinated sometimes still get infected with flu, their symptoms tend to be much milder compared to people who aren’t vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bf216a" class="body-graf"&gt;“This confirms the vaccine still can offer better protection against H3N2 than if you were unvaccinated,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. “The mismatch may not be as impactful as everyone feared.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cbfb91" class="body-graf"&gt;Bill Hanage, a professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said, “It’s more evidence that the current vaccine might not be perfect, but it’s still more than good enough to provide protection, especially when it comes to stopping serious illness.” Neither Hanage nor Rasmussen were involved with the new research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-23932e" class="body-graf"&gt;Flu strains are “master shapeshifters,” Hensley said. That’s partly why it’s so difficult to get the vaccine to match the exact strains each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7f981b" class="body-graf"&gt;The findings may be of particular importance given the record high number of pediatric flu deaths reported last season, Hanage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-df46ff" class="body-graf"&gt;On Monday, the CDC reported an additional death of a child last season, bringing the total to 289, eclipsing even the number of pediatric deaths from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7709fc" class="body-graf"&gt;Although the Department of Health this week announced it would no longer recommend annual flu shots for children, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/2025-2026.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC website&lt;/a&gt; states that “everyone 6 months and older, with rare exceptions, should get a flu vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-014d0e" class="body-graf"&gt;As of Dec. 27, the percentage of kids who’ve gotten their flu shot this year was 42.5%. That’s the lowest recorded by the end of December since at least 2019, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluvaxview/dashboard/children-vaccination-coverage.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC records&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-378548" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Vaccines won’t do any good if people don’t get them. It’s not too late,” Rasmussen said. “Everyone reading should take this news as a reminder to get a flu shot if you haven’t already.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 17:43:52 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxPN2VNY1dHVVJtdVItUXgxWk41a0psazhEUjg3UmYwN1BZbTR4alMtdjk5OU1jOWVvS0Jta3J5SzZKZFdDQ3lkUURQWHAwQ2NzVlllbnBTVkxRU2NhcnpnSkdCbDhmUm1taHN2WU9FZUdzdlZqVDNZSW15b0U3aGFWUnVRczBOTlk0dGlIU3lpZmlBSnZNUXhudldra1hrQ3pJeVVrb9IBVkFVX3lxTE5IeDZvNlVuSTVscXYzSzBsZ2F1MUJDSUdaWXkyVDVkVHFZdlZjWTBVWHI2SXRoSmx3M3ZUallSUFU5aF9vMmQzN1NBQlR3bnUwWktPTHJB</guid></item><item><title>我是否患有“超级流感” ？以下是您需要了解的信息- Gizmodo</title><link>https://gizmodo.com/do-i-have-the-super-flu-heres-what-you-need-to-know-2000706754</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl prose-science dark:prose-science"&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This winter is playing host to an especially bad flu season in the United States—one that might leave you with plenty of worries and questions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most pressing concern, especially for those of us starting to feel under the weather, might be: how do you know when you’re sick with the flu, or even the so-called “super” flu?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-5 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Cold vs flu&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are many germs out there that can cause respiratory illness. That said, most of these tend to be viruses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What we call the common cold is actually an assortment of many viruses—over 200 in total—that can all cause a respiratory infection. The flu, meanwhile, is only caused by the influenza virus, though there are many different types of influenza circulating around the world at any given time (including influenza viruses that usually sicken other animals, like birds).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Though colds and flus do share some similarities, there are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/coldflu.html"&gt;real differences&lt;/a&gt; between them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Colds are generally upper respiratory infections, meaning they’re isolated to your nose, throat, and sinuses. They usually cause symptoms like a runny or stuffy nose, sore throat, cough, and sneezing. Miserable as a cold can feel, these symptoms tend to gradually develop, are relatively mild in intensity, and clear up within a week.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Typically, flus also cause upper respiratory infections. But as anyone who’s had it can tell you, the flu often hits harder and more abruptly than a cold. So your throat might feel especially raw if you have a flu. The flu also commonly causes systemic symptoms like fever, body aches, and fatigue. And a flu will stick around longer on average, sometimes up to two weeks. Flu is also more likely to spread deeper into the lower respiratory tract, where it can trigger more severe and even life-threatening complications like pneumonia and bronchitis.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There are nuances to all this. Some germs, like the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), can cause a cold in most people but are more likely to cause &lt;a href="https://www.healthychildren.org/English/health-issues/conditions/chest-lungs/Pages/RSV-When-Its-More-Than-Just-a-Cold.aspx"&gt;severe illness&lt;/a&gt; in vulnerable groups like very young children than others, for instance. And even generally mild cold viruses can &lt;a href="https://www.mhealthfairview.org/blog/when-can-a-cold-become-serious"&gt;occasionally&lt;/a&gt; cause lower respiratory infections.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;As a general rule, though, if your respiratory illness isn’t knocking you completely off your feet, you’re probably not having the flu.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What about the super flu?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This flu season is being driven by a particular variant of H3N2 flu, known as subclade K.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;H3N2 flus tend to cause a &lt;a href="https://www.acsh.org/news/2018/01/02/some-bad-flu-news-h3n2-major-player-year-12350"&gt;bit more misery&lt;/a&gt; than other seasonal flu viruses. But K is all the more worrying because it emerged unexpectedly last year and is noticeably different on a genetic level from the strains that scientists predicted would be circulating right now. As a result, the seasonal flu vaccine is mismatched to K, reducing its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The good news is that K isn’t appearing to cause more severe illness on average than other H3N2 viruses. But its arrival does seem to have fueled unusual waves of flu around the world. In some countries like Australia, it &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12701333/"&gt;prolonged&lt;/a&gt; the flu season; in others like the UK, it helped start the season &lt;a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.46.2500854#html_fulltext"&gt;earlier&lt;/a&gt;. And in the U.S., it’s contributed to record levels of flu this winter.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluview/surveillance/2025-week-52.html"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; Monday shows that doctors’ visits for flu-like illness last week were the &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/doctor-visits-for-flu-hit-highest-level-in-almost-30-years/"&gt;highest ever recorded&lt;/a&gt; in the country since modern tracking began almost 30 years ago. The CDC also estimates that the flu has sickened 11 million people, hospitalized 120,000, and killed 5,000 so far this season. And it’s likely that flu activity will remain high for several more weeks at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Many flu diagnostic tests, either the kind you get at your doctor’s office or take at home, will identify the broad type of influenza you have (A or B). Some might even identify the strain, such as H3N2. Scientists can also conduct further testing to diagnose a specific variant, but these results are used by local and federal health officials to track flu trends and aren’t widely available to the public.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Given that and the fact that subclade K isn’t worse than the average flu, you’ll probably never know for sure if K is to blame for your flu infection. That said, the chances &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; pretty good it is.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, nearly all tested samples reported last week by public health labs came back positive for H3N2 (91%). And of all the H3N2 samples further tested by the CDC since last September, about 90% were identified as subclade K.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mismatched as it is to subclade K, the flu vaccine is still providing some level of protection against seasonal flu, data from the UK has &lt;a href="https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2025.30.46.2500854#html_fulltext:~:text=Despite%20the%20emergence,cohorts%20%5B26%5D."&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt;. So it’s still worthwhile to get your shot. Other precautions like regularly washing your hands and wearing masks can lower your risk of catching the flu as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Best of luck out there.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt;

Female B6 and female NSG mice 6–10 weeks of age were used. Animals were housed at ambient temperature and humidity (18–23 °C, 40–60% humidity) on a 12-h light–12-h dark cycle and co-housed with littermates with ad libitum access to food and water. All experimental groups were age matched, numbered and randomly assigned to treatment or control groups to minimize bias. Randomization was performed using a randomized numbering sequence at the time of injection or treatment. Investigators were not blinded during animal injections or treatments; however, researchers were blinded during data acquisition and quantification. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample size. Animal studies were performed once per condition unless otherwise specified in the figure legends. Data were collected from distinct animals, where &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; represents biologically independent samples. Mice were euthanized when total tumour burden reached 2 cm in diameter or earlier if humane end point criteria (for example, more than 20% weight loss, body condition score of less than 2 or signs of distress) were observed. These institutional limits were not exceeded in any experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec13"&gt;Cell lines and culture&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human cell lines used in this study were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (HCC1806: CRL-2335, from a female patient; MDA-MB-231: HTB-26, from a female patient). Mouse EO771 breast cancer cells were obtained from CH3 BioSystems (94A001, from B6 mice). Cell lines obtained from ATCC and CH3 BioSystems are authenticated by the suppliers; no additional authentication was performed by the authors. Lines were regularly tested for mycoplasma contamination using the MycoAlert PLUS Mycoplasma Detection Kit (LT07-710, Lonza BioSciences). All cells were cultured in a Heracell humidified incubator (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37 °C and 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Cell lines were routinely maintained in RPMI-1640 (10-040-CV, Corning Life Sciences) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (10437-028, Gibco), and for cell culture experiments, 10% dialysed fetal bovine serum (26400-044, Gibco) was supplemented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RPMI-1640 medium lacking serine or arginine was made using a previous method&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 61" title="Muir, A. et al.

In brief, enough of all amino acids and sodium phosphate dibasic (S5136, Sigma-Aldrich) of RPMI-1640 media except for serine or arginine were weighed out to make 25 l of media, then the resulting powders were homogenized using an electric blade coffee grinder (80365, Hamilton Beach) that had been washed with methanol then water. The resulting powders were resuspended in water along with sodium bicarbonate (S5761, Sigma-Aldrich) and RPMI-1640 medium without amino acids and sodium phosphate (R8999-04A, US Biological) to make RPMI-1640 medium lacking serine or arginine. Serine or arginine was reconstituted in water to generate stock solutions and added back as needed to reach 286 µM serine or 1.15 mM arginine, reflecting standard RPMI-1640 concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DMEM medium lacking serine or arginine was prepared using a base powder formulation lacking all amino acids and pyruvate (D9800-13, US Biological). To this base, glucose, sodium pyruvate and sodium bicarbonate were added to match standard DMEM composition. Amino acids were weighed out and homogenized as described above for RPMI, then dissolved into the reconstituted DMEM base.

The sheath gas flow was set to 40 units, the auxiliary gas flow was set to 15 units and the sweep gas flow was set to 1 unit. MS data acquisition was performed in a range of &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; = 70–1,000, with the resolution set at 70,000, the automatic gain control target at 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; and the maximum injection time at 20 ms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec24"&gt;Cell proliferation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For assessment of proliferation by continuous live-cell imaging, cells were trypsinized, pelleted and washed with PBS, counted, resuspended in the appropriate medium and then plated directly into clear 96-well plates. Cells were then treated with or without the relevant rescue metabolite, and plates were placed into an IncuCyte Live Cell Analysis Imaging System S3 (Sartorius) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Images were acquired every 3 h using the 10x objective. Cell confluence was determined from a mask generated by the standard settings in the IncuCyte Zoom Analysis S3 v2018B software. Cells were plated in either RPMI or DMEM medium lacking the metabolite corresponding to their engineered auxotrophy: asparagine (&lt;i&gt;ASNS&lt;/i&gt; knockout), arginine (&lt;i&gt;ASS1&lt;/i&gt; knockout), proline (&lt;i&gt;PYCR&lt;/i&gt; knockout) or serine (&lt;i&gt;PHGDH&lt;/i&gt; knockout). &lt;i&gt;DHODH&lt;/i&gt;-knockout and &lt;i&gt;GART&lt;/i&gt;-knockout experiments were performed in complete RPMI medium. The metabolite concentrations used for rescues unless otherwise stated were: 1.15 mM arginine, 379 µM asparagine, 1 mM citrulline, 100 µM hypoxanthine, 174 µM proline, 286 µM serine and 100 µM uridine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec25"&gt;Western blot&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells were washed once in PBS and scraped into RIPA lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (5871, Cell Signaling Technology), rocked for 15 min at 4 °C, and insoluble material was sedimented by centrifugation at 21,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined via Bradford Assay, and samples were mixed with LDS sample buffer (NP0008, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol and then incubated at 95 °C for 5 min. Proteins were resolved by SDS–PAGE and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using a wet tank transfer system (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in 5% milk in TBST and probed overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate antibody diluted in 5% BSA in TBST. For detection, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit (1:5,000; 7074, Cell Signaling Technology) or anti-mouse (1:5,000; 7076, Cell Signaling Technology) IgG secondary antibody diluted in 5% milk in TBST, and chemiluminescent signal was detected using a digital imager (LAS 4000, GE Healthcare). The primary antibodies used were: ASNS (1:1,000; 14681-1-AP, Proteintech), ASS1 (1:1,000; clone D4O4B, 70720, Cell Signaling Technology), PHGDH (1:1,000; HPA021241, Sigma-Aldrich), PYCR1 (1:1,000; 13108-1-AP, Proteintech), PYCR2 (1:1,000; 17146-1-AP, Proteintech), PYCRL (1:1,000; clone OTI1B12, NBP2-03337, Novus Biologicals), PYCRL (1:1,000; A17763, ABclonal), DHODH (1:100; clone E-8, sc-166348, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), GART (1:1,000; 13659-1-AP, Proteintech), β-actin (1:5,000; clone D6A8, 8457, Cell Signaling Technology) and vinculin (1:1,000; clone E1E9V, 13901, Cell Signaling Technology). In cases in which re-probing of the same membrane was required, the membrane was incubated with hydrogen peroxide solution 30% (w/w in water; H1009, Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at 37 °C to inactivate horseradish peroxidase.

Forty-eight hours post-transfection, medium was collected and filtered through a 0.45-µm low-protein-binding membrane. Lentivirus-containing supernatants were used immediately or stored at −80 °C. Cell lines were transduced with virus and 10 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; polybrene for 24 h.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec27"&gt;CRISPR–Cas9-mediated gene knockout&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cas9-expressing cell lines were generated by infecting parental cell lines with viral particles containing lentiCas9/blast (52962, Addgene) followed by selection with 10 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; blasticidin. Two guide RNAs (gRNAs) per gene of interest were designed by CRISPick (&lt;a href="https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gppx/crispick/public"&gt;https://portals.broadinstitute.org/gppx/crispick/public&lt;/a&gt;) and cloned into lentiGuide-Puro (52963, Addgene).

Cas9&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell lines were transduced with lentiGuide-Puro-gRNA viral particles, then selected with 1 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; puromycin. Single cells were plated into individual wells of 96-well plates in RPMI medium; following expansion, western blotting confirmed complete knockout. To generate and maintain &lt;i&gt;DHODH&lt;/i&gt;-knockout or &lt;i&gt;GART&lt;/i&gt;-knockout cells, 100 µM uridine or 100 µM hypoxanthine were supplemented in RPMI medium, respectively. For the generation of &lt;i&gt;PYCR1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PYCR2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PYCR3&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;PYCRL&lt;/i&gt;) triple knockout MDA-MB-231 or HCC1806 cells, two gRNAs targeting both &lt;i&gt;PYCR1&lt;/i&gt; (exons 4 and 5) and &lt;i&gt;PYCR2&lt;/i&gt; (exons 2 and 3), and two gRNAs targeting &lt;i&gt;PYCR3&lt;/i&gt; (exon 3), were used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To knock out &lt;i&gt;Pycr1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Pycr2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pycr3&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;PycrI&lt;/i&gt;) in EO771, we used ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes with Cas9–GFP and Cas9–RFP. The Cas9 protein and gRNAs specific to each target gene were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) as RNA oligonucleotides and used to assemble RNP complexes. EO771 cells were nucleofected with the RNP complexes using a 4D-Nucleofector (Lonza Bioscience) and the SF Cell Line 4D-Nucleofector X Kit L (V4XC2024, Lonza Walkersville) with Pulse Code CM-150. Post-nucleofection, cells were cultured and monitored for GFP and RFP expression. Single-cell sorting was performed 24 h after nucleofection to isolate successfully nucleofected cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec28"&gt;DepMap and metastatic potential data&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gene expression, CRISPR-gene dependency and metastatic potential values used for correlation analyses were sourced from the Broad Institute DepMap portal website, 24Q2 release (&lt;a href="https://depmap.org/portal"&gt;https://depmap.org/portal&lt;/a&gt;).

Metabolite concentrations were log transformed, and metabolites that contained greater than 50% missing values were removed before analysis. For the remainder of the metabolites, missing values were replaced using one-fifth of the lowest positive value. Hierarchical clustering was performed with Euclidean distance measurement and clustering by the Ward algorithm. Univariate analysis was performed comparing metabolite levels between groups in which metabolite differences of interest were defined by a fold change greater than 2 and significance as a raw &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value of less than 0.05 assuming unequal group variance. Using the fold change and adjusted &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; value cut-offs, the number of differentially expressed metabolites was determined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec30"&gt;Illustrations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experimental schema and illustrative models were generated using BioRender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec31"&gt;Reporting summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further information on research design is available in the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09898-9#MOESM2"&gt;Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary&lt;/a&gt; linked to this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:25:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE92VmUwWHVGWTlOLWdwWUIyYkJWLTNVeWtzMVk0M2hzajdZVERiNURyVzc2ZV9qOHZsenlodXlUc2k4ckpLbG8zNmd6ejVoZmpUcEJFSnp0QjFGNzlRZ3hB</guid></item><item><title>神经上皮回路促进感觉收敛和肠道免疫-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09921-z</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol class="c-article-references" data-track-component="outbound reference" data-track-context="references section"&gt;&lt;li class="c-article-references__item js-c-reading-companion-references-item" data-counter="1."&gt;&lt;p class="c-article-references__text" id="ref-CR1"&gt;Gieseck, R.

Wilcoxon rank-sum test was performed to define the markers specific to individual clusters and annotate each cluster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyses for the epithelial and immune compartments followed a similar workflow to that described above, except that further rounds of iterative clustering were performed after removal of doublet and low-quality cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec12"&gt;Generation of a Xenium-based spatial transcriptomics dataset&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec13"&gt;Human sample collection&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixteen patients diagnosed with UC, CD or diverticulitis who were recruited into the Prospective Registry in IBD Study at MGH (PRISM) study at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) participated in this study. Informed consent was obtained from all patients in accordance with the protocol approved by the institutional review board (IRB; 2004P001067). The study protocol complied with all relevant ethical regulations. Samples from patients with diverticulitis were pathologist-confirmed histologically normal. Excess tissues from clinically warranted surgical resections were collected for research purposes. IRB-approved secondary use protocol 2020P001262 allowed use of these tissues in research at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec14"&gt;Human colon sample processing&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resected human colon samples were fixed in 10% formalin overnight and stored in 70% ethanol. Tissue samples were trimmed and oriented in a tissue embedding cassette (Thomas Scientific, 230274-000B) such that all of the histological features of the colon were preserved. Paraffin embedding was done at the Koch Institute at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) histology facility to generate formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks and stored at 4 °C. For haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;amp;E) staining and pathology assessment of the tissues, FFPE tissue blocks were sectioned at 5 µm thickness on a microtome (Leica HistoCore AUTOCUTl) and placed on glass slides (VWR, Superfrost Plus). Slides were baked at 42 °C for 3 h before being stored in a desiccator overnight. Glass slides containing tissue sections were baked at 60 °C for 30 min, then H&amp;amp;E stained using an automatic H&amp;amp;E stainer at the MIT histology facility. Tissue slides were imaged with a ×10 objective using a Zeiss Axio light microscope with a Metafer slide-scanning platform. During microtome sectioning, 40 µm tissue scrolls were collected to assess tissue RNA quality with DV200 scores. These sections were placed in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes and stored at −80 °C until analysis. RNA was extracted using an Qiagen RNeasy FFPE Kit (Qiagen, catalogue no. 73504), and DV200 scores were assessed with an RNA Pico chip on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec15"&gt;Sample preparation for Xenium profiling&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human colon FFPE blocks were sectioned at 5 µm thickness on a microtome (Leica HistoCore AUTOCUTl) and placed on Xenium glass slides (10x Genomics) following slide equilibration at room temperature for at least 30 min. Slides were baked at 42 °C for 3 h and thereafter stored in a desiccator overnight. Tissues were baked at 60 °C for 2 h, deparaffinized in xylene (MilliporeSigma, 214736-4L), ethanol rehydrated and decross-linked according to the manufacturer’s protocol (10x Genomics, demonstrated protocol CG000580 rev. C). Protocol CG000582, rev. F (10x Genomics) was used for probe hybridization, ligation and amplification for eight of the samples, whereas user guide CG000749 rev. B (10x Genomics) with further cell segmentation staining was used for the other eight human samples. A customized 480-plex gene probe panel (probe ID: HC3GPZ) was designed and used for all human samples. The probes were hybridized on to the tissue for 19 h at 50 °C. When used, the slides were incubated with cell segmentation markers for 17 h and 30 min at 4 °C. Buffers were prepared for the Xenium Analyzer instrument (software v.3.1.0.0) according to the manufacturer’s protocol for the Xenium v1 workflow (10x Genomics, user guide CG000584 rev. G). Selected regions of interest covering the full tissue of each sample were imaged, and spatially localized transcriptional data were collected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mouse colon tissue blocks embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT, Tissue-Tek) were cryosectioned at 10 µm thickness in a cryostat (Leica, CM1950) at −20 °C. Tissue sections were placed on Xenium glass slides (10x Genomics) and stored in a slide mailer at −80 °C for 4 days. Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Thermo Fisher Scientific, BP531-25) and permeabilized according to the manufacturer’s protocol (10x Genomics, demonstrated protocol CG000581 rev. D). Tissue slides were further processed following the 10x Genomics user guide (CG000749 rev. B). A customized 480-plex gene probe panel (ID: JUR2CE) was used, with hybridization for 21 h at 50 °C. Tissues were stained with cell segmentation markers for 17 h and 30 min at 4 °C. Buffers for the Xenium Analyzer instrument (software v.3.2.0.1) were prepared following the Xenium v1 workflow (10x Genomics, user guide CG000584 rev. G). Slides were imaged, and transcriptional data were collected using a Xenium Analyzer instrument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Post-Xenium tissue slides were incubated for 10 min with 10 mM sodium hydrosulfite (Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the tissue quencher (10x Genomics, demonstrated protocol CG000613 rev. B) and H&amp;amp;E stained using the automatic H&amp;amp;E stainer at the MIT Histology Facility. Glass slides were imaged on a Zeiss Axio microscope with a Metafer slide-scanning platform using a ×10 objective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec16"&gt;Analysis of human spatial transcriptomics dataset&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samples were processed in two batches, with and without the cell segmentation staining kit. For tissues processed without the cell segmentation staining kit, we used a nucleus segmentation mask to restrict the counting of transcripts per cell located in its nucleus. In total, a gene expression matrix of 4,477,548 cells × 480 genes was obtained from 16 human tissues and analysed using a similar workflow to that described for the scRNA-seq dataset (see Supplementary Data &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09907-x#MOESM5"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; for the panel gene list). The analysis was implemented in Scanpy. In brief, quality control was performed to remove poor-quality cells with total RNA counts less than 10. Count normalization and log transformation were followed by regression of the effect of total RNA per cell and scaling. Principal component analysis was conducted to generate the top 50 principal components. Batch correction was then performed using the harmony package, with variables patient and batch as covariates After inspection of the elbow plot, we used the top 30 eigenvectors to construct a &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-nearest neighbour graph with &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;_neighbors = 15. Subsequently, the Leiden clustering algorithm was applied (resolution = 0.5) to cluster the spots, and the resulting clusters were visualized with the UMAP embedding algorithm. On the basis of the expression of known markers of epithelial cells (&lt;i&gt;KRT8&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;EPCAM&lt;/i&gt;), fibroblasts (&lt;i&gt;PDGFRA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;C1S&lt;/i&gt;), stromal cells (&lt;i&gt;PECAM1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ACTA2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;DES&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;S100B&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;RGS5&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CD9&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ANO1&lt;/i&gt;), lymphocyte populations (&lt;i&gt;CD79A&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;MZB1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CD3D&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TRAC&lt;/i&gt;), and myeloid cells (&lt;i&gt;C1QB&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CD83&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AIF1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TPSAB&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CD36&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;FCGR3B&lt;/i&gt;), the clusters were then subdivided into five main compartments for subsequent iterative rounds of clustering and analysis. In contrast to the scRNA-seq analysis workflow, we further subdivided the stromal cells into fibroblast and non-fibroblast compartments, and likewise the immune cells into lymphocytes and myeloid cells for resolution of cell type heterogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compartment-specific analysis and clustering was implemented using a similar workflow to that described above by setting Leiden algorithm parameter resolution = 1. Clustering was followed by post hoc analysis of identified clusters to remove poor-quality cells, that is, clusters with low total RNA counts or those expressing lineage markers from other compartments. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was performed to define the markers specific to individual clusters and annotate them. Altogether, we identified 56 unique cell types across the different compartments in the spatial atlas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec17"&gt;Harmonizing single-cell and spatial atlases&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the scRNA-seq IBD atlas (scIBD) revealed 51 distinct cell types, whereas 56 distinct cell types were found for the spatial IBD atlas (spIBD). Broadly, most of the cell types identified in the scIBD were also identified in the spIBD, which also recovered cell types that are known to be located deeper in the muscularis propria, that is, interstitial cells of Cajal, neurons, and smooth muscle cells located in the inner circular and outer longitudinal layer of the muscularis proporia. As the scRNA-seq was based on biopsies, these cell types were not captured. Likewise, monocytes, follicular B cells and IL6&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; fibroblasts were identified only in the spIBD. On the other hand, colonic plasma B cells, naive CD8 T cells, and M cells (microfold) were captured only in the scIBD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, we observed some cell types and states that were captured in the scIBD but could not be distinguished in the spIBD. For instance, we recovered the T helper 1 (T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1) and T helper 17 (T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17) polarized states of differentiated CD4 T cells in the scIBD, but the heterogeneity between these cells could not be resolved in the spIBD; hence, they were annotated as the same cluster (CD4 T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1/T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17). Naive and memory B cells were recovered in the scIBD, but their heterogeneity could not be distinguished in spIBD. Likewise, capillaries and arteries were distinct in the scIBD but grouped into the same cluster in spIBD. &lt;i&gt;WNT5B&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;NPY&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PTGIS&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; cells were identified in the scIBD but could not be distinguished in the spIBD. Conversely, &lt;i&gt;SPP1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages were identified in the spIBD, whereas &lt;i&gt;C1Q&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MHCII&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages could not be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the ligand–receptor analysis (described below), we focused on the common set of cell types between the two atlases and, wherever possible, used the closest cell type as a proxy when the cell types could not be identified in the spIBD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec18"&gt;Cellular niche analysis on the basis of spatial transcriptomics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We evaluated the composition of cell types in the proximal neighbourhoods of each cell to identify the cellular niches (microenvironments) shared across multiple samples. For every cell in our spatial atlas, we counted the number of distinct cell types present within a radius of 30 μm, thereby generating a frequency matrix of 3,382,726 microenvironments by 56 cell types. The median number of total cells sampled within the 30-μm radius was 14 cells (range: 1–113). Next, we implemented a &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-means clustering approach using the scikit-learn (v.0.22) package and evaluated the stability of clusters across a range of &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; values (5–35) using the silhouette score. We obtained the highest score at &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt; = 19, suggesting the existence of 19 distinct niches (N0–N18) in our dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec19"&gt;Niche and cell type enrichment analysis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chi-squared test of independence was performed to evaluate the enrichment of cell types in a given niche. A contingency table summarizing the count distribution of each cell type across niches in the overall spatial atlas was generated, and the chi-squared statistic (&lt;i&gt;χ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) was computed using observed and expected frequencies, assuming independence between variables. Degrees of freedom were calculated as follows: d.f. = (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; − 1) × (&lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt; − 1), where &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; is the number of distinct niches, and &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt; is the number of cell types. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values for cell type enrichment in each niche were obtained using standardized residuals and corrected for multiple testing using the Bonferroni method. &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec20"&gt;Cell type composition analysis in single-cell and spatial atlases&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To compare the compositional differences between patients with disease and healthy individuals, we used the scCODA toolbox&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 58" title="Büttner, M., Ostner, J., Müller, C.

Within these two studies, different tissue enriched fractions (epithelial sorted, lamina propria, immune sorted or whole tissue) were used to prepare the libraries; hence, we performed the analyses at a sample library level. scCODA was implemented on the study-specific cell count matrices by adding a pseudocount of 0.001 and considering the following covariates: patientID + enriched_fraction + disease status, using smooth muscle cells as a reference cell type because their abundance did not change between the conditions. Separate analyses were performed for patients with UC and those with CD, using the respective control participants as the reference, and a false discovery rate (FDR) &amp;lt; 20% was considered to indicate a significant change in abundance of the corresponding cell type. Disease-specific effect sizes (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;) and log fold change in abundance (for cell types with credible effects only) were visualized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the spatial atlas, we performed the analyses at the patient level. Specifically, we first visualized the relative abundance of each niche across the different conditions, and identified niche N3 as the reference niche, as it did not change between conditions. scCODA was then implemented by adding a pseudocount of 0.001, using the non-IBD controls as reference. Niches were considered to have significantly changed in abundance if FDR &amp;lt; 20%. &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; values and log fold change in abundance (for niches with credible effects) were visualized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec21"&gt;Differential expression analysis on scRNA-seq atlas&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pseudobulk expression for each gene was first computed for each cell type in every patient and then analysed using the decoupler and pydeseq2 packages. Differential expression was evaluated using the respective controls for UC inflamed or CD inflamed participants, including 10x chemistry as a covariate in the model. In the UC inflamed group, genes with FDR-adjusted &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 were considered to show statistically significant differential expression; for the CD inflamed group, this threshold was reduced to FDR-adjusted &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.1, because fewer genes showed differential regulation among these patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec22"&gt;Inference of cell communication network on the basis of spatial constraints&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intercellular cross-talk was analysed with the cellphonedb (v.5.0) package using the DEG analysis method. The scIBD was used as the reference, and separate analyses were performed for patients with UC and those with CD. First, differentially upregulated genes passing the significance threshold in inflamed tissues compared with control tissues, as described in the ‘Differential expression analysis on scRNA-seq atlas’ section, were used as the input for each cell type. As IAFs were predominantly observed in inflamed tissues, the differential expression analysis did not yield significantly upregulated genes in IAFs because of low numbers among controls. Hence, to obtain IAF upregulated genes, we performed differential expression at the pseudobulk level between IAFs and non-IAF fibroblast populations and appended the results to the input table. The threshold parameter in cellphonedb was modified to include genes with greater than 5% expression in a given cell type for scoring of interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To infer spatially constrained ligand–receptor communication scores, we used the list mapping each niche to significantly enriched cell types, as described in the ‘Niche and cell type enrichment analysis’ section, as input. As some cell types identified in the scIBD could not be identified in the spIBD, as described in the ‘Harmonizing single-cell and spatial atlases’ section, we used the niche membership of the closest cell type as a proxy. Specifically, CD4 T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1 and T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17 cells in the scIBD were assumed to be members of the same niches as CD4 T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1/T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;17 cells in the spatial atlas, &lt;i&gt;WNT5B&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;NPY&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;WNT5B&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;PTGIS&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; were considered to be the same as &lt;i&gt;WNT5B&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, capillaries and arteries were assumed to be the same as capillaries and arterioles, naive and memory B cells were assumed to be the same as naive B cells in the spatial atlas, and &lt;i&gt;C1Q&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages were assumed to localize to the same niches as &lt;i&gt;LYVE1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The total sum of significant ligand–receptor interaction scores were counted between a given sender–receiver pair of cell types and used to derive an adjacency matrix for network analysis. The igraph package was used to plot a directed and weighted network graph on the adjacency matrix, with edge thickness representing the sum total interaction score. Stromal compartment cells were removed from the network graph to highlight communication with IAFs and non-stromal cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec23"&gt;Histopathology annotations&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;H&amp;amp;E-stained sections of each tissue were used to manually identify structures pertaining to various anatomical and pathological regions. Using Xenium Explorer (10x Genomics), we aligned H&amp;amp;E images to the slide, selected the regions manually and extracted cell barcodes. We ascertained the following anatomical regions: the normal mucosa, submucosa and muscularis propria; and the following pathological regions: mucosa with predominantly active colitis, mucosa with predominantly chronic colitis, fibromuscular hyperplasia, lymphoid aggregates and granuloma. Each tissue was also qualitatively graded for stage of fibrosis, ulceration and severity of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec24"&gt;Identification of putative driver ligands of IAF gene program&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we identified transcription factors (TFs) enriched in IAFs on the basis of their expression levels. Cluster-specific enrichment analysis in the stromal compartment atlas was performed using Wilcoxon rank-sum test to identify genes enriched in IAFs. The list was then subset to the list of known TFs to yield 23 putative mediators. In parallel, we implemented DoRothEA to infer the activity of known TFs&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 59" title="Garcia-Alonso, L., Holland, C.

Then, we identified the enriched TFs in IAFs using the Wilcoxon test, considering all non-IAF stromal cells as the background. We selected TFs with a mean activity difference greater than 0.75 and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01, yielding a list of 34 putative TFs. The final list consisted of 55 unique TFs that putatively orchestrated the IAF program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, we leveraged the ligand–target regulatory potential model available from NicheNet to identify potential ligands whose signalling converged on to the enriched TFs. Regulatory potential scores were derived by incorporating several data sources that covered ligand–receptor relationships, signal transduction and gene regulation events and then applying network propagation methods to quantify the signal flowing from a ligand through its receptors on to the signalling proteins, transcriptional regulators and, finally, target genes. For each TF in our list, we selected the top ten ligands with the strongest regulatory potential scores derived from the model. Only ligands that appeared at least five times in the top-ten list were selected for further analysis. Subsequently, we restricted the list of ligands to those whose receptors were expressed in more than 5% of IAF cells. Ultimately, this pipeline yielded 13 putative ligands, which were further expanded on the basis of ligand family membership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec25"&gt;Analysis of mouse spatial transcriptomics dataset&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tissues were processed with the cell segmentation staining kit; thus, counting of transcripts was not restricted to the nucleus. In total, a dataset of 2,792,913 cells × 480 genes was generated from 12 mouse large intestines, representing three biological replicates from the following conditions: &lt;i&gt;Glis3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;f/f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;;cre&lt;/i&gt; treated with DSS, &lt;i&gt;Glis3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;f/f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;;cre&lt;/i&gt; treated with water, &lt;i&gt;Glis3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;f/f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; treated with DSS and &lt;i&gt;Glis3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;f/f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; treated with water. Data were analysed using a similar workflow to that described above (see Supplementary Data &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09907-x#MOESM5"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; for the panel gene list used to define cell types).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In brief, cells with total RNA counts less than 10 were removed, followed by normalization and log transformation, regression of total RNA, and scaling. The top 40 principal components were used to construct the &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;-nearest neighbour graph, and Leiden clustering was applied (resolution = 0.5), followed by visualization with UMAP. Subsequent iterative rounds of clustering were performed by grouping the clusters into four main compartments: epithelial, fibroblast, stromal and immune, including lymphocytes and myeloid cells. The following markers were broadly used: &lt;i&gt;Krt8&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Epcam&lt;/i&gt; (epithelial cells); &lt;i&gt;Pdgfra&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Dpt&lt;/i&gt; (fibroblasts); &lt;i&gt;Pecam1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Acta2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Des&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;S100b&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Rgs5&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Snap25&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ano1&lt;/i&gt; (stromal cells); &lt;i&gt;Cd79a&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Mzb1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cd3d&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Trac&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Gata3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Xcl1&lt;/i&gt; (lymphocytes); and &lt;i&gt;Tyrobp&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Aif1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ccr2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Fgr&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;C1qa&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cd68&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cd83&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Trem2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Lyve1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Clec9a&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cd209a&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Fpr1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cxcr2&lt;/i&gt; (myeloid cells).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compartment-specific analysis and clustering was implemented using a similar workflow to that described above by setting Leiden algorithm parameter resolution = 1, except for the immune compartment, for which resolution = 1.5 was used. Post hoc inspection of clusters led to removal of poor-quality cells. Finally, for cell type annotation, we performed a Wilcoxon rank-sum test to define the markers specific to each cluster and inspected the spatial distribution of each cluster and the expression of cell-type-specific markers listed in Supplementary Data &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09907-x#MOESM5"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, we identified 55 unique cell types exhibiting distinct expression signatures and spatial distribution in the mouse large intestine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec26"&gt;Mice&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal studies complied with all relevant ethical regulations. All mice used in this study were co-housed in specific-pathogen-free facilities at MGH. For all experiments, 5- to 20-week-old male or female sex-matched mice were used. Mouse strains included C57BL/6J &lt;i&gt;Il11&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;mNG&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice, &lt;i&gt;Il11&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;f/f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice (C57BL/6JGpt-Il11&lt;sup&gt;em1Cflox&lt;/sup&gt;/Gpt; GemPharmatech T051922), &lt;i&gt;Glis3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;f/f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice (C57BL/6JGpt-Glis3&lt;sup&gt;em1Cflox&lt;/sup&gt;/Gpt; GemPharmatech, T010949), R26-CreERT2 mice (B6.129-Gt(ROSA)26Sor&lt;sup&gt;tm1(cre/ERT2)Tyj&lt;/sup&gt;/J; Jax, 008463) and PDGFRa-CRE mice (C57BL/6-Tg(Pdgfra-cre)1Clc/J, Jax, catalogue no. 013148). No statistical calculations were performed to determine sample size. Genotype-matched mice were randomly assigned to each treatment group, and no blinding was performed. Mice were housed with a 12 h dark, 12 h light cycle, at an ambient temperature of 18–24 °C and 30–70% relative humidity, and provided with food and water ad libitum. All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with protocol 2003N000158 approved by the MGH Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and animals were cared for according to the requirements of the National Research Council’s Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec27"&gt;Generation of &lt;i&gt;Il11&lt;/i&gt;

Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) was synthesized containing a T2A-mNeonGreen sequence flanked by approximately 400-nucleotide-long homology arms of the &lt;i&gt;Il11&lt;/i&gt; gene upstream and downstream of the stop codon. A single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) sequence of this donor template was synthesized with the Guide-it Long ssDNA Production System following the manufacturer’s protocol (Takara, catalogue no. 632644). Verified gRNA, ssDNA and Cas9 with NLS (PNA Bio, CP02) complex were microinjected into zygotes by the Harvard Transgenic Mouse Core. The resulting &lt;i&gt;Il11&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;mNG&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice were backcrossed on the C57BL/6J background for three generations, followed by heterozygous crosses to obtain homozygous reporter mice.

Heterozygous pups were crossed together to generate homozygous conditional knockout mice. Homozygous &lt;i&gt;Il11&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;f/f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice were then bred with R26-CreERT2 mice (B6.129-Gt(ROSA)26Sor&lt;sup&gt;tm1(cre/ERT2)Tyj&lt;/sup&gt;/J; Jax, catalogue no. 008463) to generate homozygous &lt;i&gt;Il11&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;f/f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, hemizygous &lt;i&gt;cre&lt;/i&gt; mice. &lt;i&gt;Glis3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;f/f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice were bred with hemizygous PDGFRa-CRE mice (C57BL/6-Tg(Pdgfra-cre)1Clc/J; Jax, catalogue no. 013148) to generate homozygous &lt;i&gt;Glis3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;f/f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, hemizygous &lt;i&gt;PDGFRa-CRE&lt;/i&gt; mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec29"&gt;Acute and chronic DSS colitis&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DSS experiments were performed as previously described&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 14" title="Jasso, G.

In brief, mice were given 2.0% (weight/volume) DSS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, J14489-22) dissolved in water for 7 days for the acute model of DSS. In the chronic model, DSS administration was followed by a water recovery phase lasting for another 7 days. This cycle was repeated two more times, with mouse weights recorded daily. Upon cessation of each model (at day 7 for the acute DSS model, day 42 for &lt;i&gt;Il11&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Glis3&lt;/i&gt; mouse experiments, or day 35 for cytokine neutralization experiments), mice were euthanized, and colons were obtained for phenotyping. For &lt;i&gt;Il11&lt;/i&gt; mice, chronic DSS experiments represented three pooled independent experiments with the following cohort replicates per experiment: &lt;i&gt;Il11&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;f/f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, water (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3, 4, 11); &lt;i&gt;Il11&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;f/f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;;cre&lt;/i&gt;, water (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 0, 0, 14); &lt;i&gt;Il11&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;f/f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, DSS (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 4, 3, 10); &lt;i&gt;Il11&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;f/f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;;cre&lt;/i&gt;, DSS (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3, 4, 3). For &lt;i&gt;Glis3&lt;/i&gt; mice, chronic DSS experiments represented four pooled independent experiments with the following cohort replicates per experiment: &lt;i&gt;Glis3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;f/f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, water (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 4, 4, 4, 6); &lt;i&gt;Glis3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;f/f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;;cre&lt;/i&gt;, water (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 0, 0, 0, 21); &lt;i&gt;Glis3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;f/f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, DSS (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 4, 7, 3, 6); &lt;i&gt;Glis3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;f/f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;;cre&lt;/i&gt;, DSS (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3, 4, 3, 5). For cytokine neutralization, chronic DSS experiments represented two pooled independent experiments with the following cohort replicates per experiment: &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3, 4. Data pooling was performed by aligning animal data by timepoint (for instance, percentage weight change by day of DSS or water treatment), with all downstream analyses restricted to end point measurements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec30"&gt;Tamoxifen administration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Il11&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;f/f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Il11&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;f/f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;;&lt;i&gt;cre&lt;/i&gt; mice were treated with DSS following the chronic DSS model. After cessation of each cycle of DSS administration, mice were intraperitoneally injected with tamoxifen (Sigma, T5648) dissolved in corn oil (Sigma, C8267) (200 µl of 20 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). Tamoxifen was administered for 3 consecutive days, each at a different site of the mouse abdomen for each cycle of water treatment. Weights were monitored daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec31"&gt;Cytokine neutralization&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Il11&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;mNG&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice were treated with DSS following the chronic DSS model. At the start of each cycle of DSS administration, mice were intraperitoneally injected with monoclonal antibodies directed against IgG (BioXCell, BP0083), anti-TGFβ (BioXCell, BP0057), anti-IL-1β (Invivogen, mil1b-mab9-1T), or a combination of anti-TGFβ and anti-IL-1β. Antibodies were diluted in PBS and intraperitoneally injected at different sites of the mouse abdomen on the first and third days of each cycle of DSS administration (100 µl, 100 µg per mouse). Weights were monitored daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec32"&gt;Mouse colon cryosectioning&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Water- and DSS-treated mice were euthanized with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee protocol. Colons were removed, flushed and rinsed in PBS (Sigma, D8537-500ml), then cut longitudinally to expose the lumen. Colons were rolled from the distal to the proximal end with forceps and placed in cryo-blocks (Tissue-Tek, catalogue no. 25608-916) containing OCT (Tissue-Tek, catalogue no. 25608-930) on dry ice. Frozen colon Swiss rolls were sectioned in a Leica CM1950 cryostat at −20 °C into 10 µm slices, which were placed on to glass slides (Fisherbrand, catalogue no. 22-230-900) for imaging; and 50 µm and 100 µm slices were collected for RNA and protein extraction, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec33"&gt;Mouse colon staining&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec34"&gt;Immunofluorescence&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fresh-frozen tissue sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Services, catalogue no. 15710-S) diluted in PBS (v/v) for 10 min at room temperature, followed by three washes in PBS. Tissues were then permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS (v/v) for 10 min at room temperature, followed by three washes in PBS. Tissues were blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA; LGC Clinical Diagnostics, catalogue no. 1900-0016) in PBS (w/v) for 20 min at room temperature, then incubated with diluted primary antibodies in 4% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature (1:400 for anti-mNeonGreen (Proteintech, #nfms), 1:400 for anti-CD68 (Cell Signaling Technology, 97778S)). Tissues were then washed three times in PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies in 4% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature (1:500 AF-488 conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Proteintech, sms1AF488-1), 1:1,000 AF-594 conjugated anti-rabbit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-21207)). Tissues were washed three times in PBS, rinsed in deionized water, mounted with ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Thermo Fisher, P36962) and sealed with a cover glass (Corning, catalogue no. 2975-245) for 24 h. Images were captured on a Nikon Ti2-E inverted microscope equipped with a CSU-W1 spinning disc confocal system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;QuPath v.0.6.0 was used to quantify the percentages of IL-11&lt;sup&gt;mNG&lt;/sup&gt; fibroblasts in whole-colon Swiss rolls from &lt;i&gt;Il11&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;mNG&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice subjected to chronic DSS. Channel minimum, maximum and gamma values were set to equal measurements across the sample cohort. Cell detection was performed on the basis of DAPI-stained nuclei. IL-11&lt;sup&gt;mNG&lt;/sup&gt; cells were then defined by setting a single measurement classifier on objects filtered on all DAPI-stained cells. A channel filter was then set for ‘Cell: 488 nm mean’. An ‘Above Threshold’ was then set that defined IL-11&lt;sup&gt;mNG+&lt;/sup&gt; cells on the basis of the background signal distribution of 488 nm mean cell measurements in water-treated colon samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec35"&gt;Masson’s trichrome staining&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staining was performed following the Masson’s Trichrome Stain Kit protocol (Vitroview, VB-3016). In brief, frozen tissue was acclimated to room temperature, fixed in 10% formalin for 30 min, and rinsed in distilled water three times. Tissues were then incubated in Bouin’s fluid for 1 h at 60 °C, washed in running tap water for 5 min, incubated with Weigert’s A+B solution mixture (1:1 mixture) for 7 min, and rinsed again with running tap water for 5 min, followed by incubation with Biebrich scarlet–acid fuschin stain for 5 min. Tissues were next rinsed in distilled water, then incubated with phosphomolybdic–phosphotungstic acid solution for a total of 10 min. Without rinsing, aniline blue solution was added for 15 min, followed by three washes in distilled water. Tissues were briefly rinsed in acetic acid, dehydrated with 90% and then 100% ethanol for 2 min each, cleared in xylene (Sigma, 214736-1L) for 5 min, three times, and finally mounted with Cytoseal 60 (EMS, catalogue no. 18007) and sealed with a cover glass. Images were captured on a Nikon Ti2-E inverted microscope for detailed magnification images or a Leica Aperio VERSA scanning system for quantification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For quantification of colonic collagen with Masson’s trichrome-stained colon samples, FIJI imaging quantification software v.1.54p was used on images captured on the Leica Aperio VERSA scanning system. Images were increased in brightness and contrast by setMinAndMax (−12, 228). Masson’s trichrome stain deconvolution was then performed using the Colour Deconvolution 2 plugin, setting the vectors to User Values defined by Colour[1](R1: 0.412010759, G1: 0.849633569, B1: 0.329195889), Colour[2](R2:0.587269268, G2:0.67744923, B2: 0.442919122), Colour[3](R3: 0.804103811, G3: 0.584262903, B3:0.109790353). Only the blue collagen channel was used; red (muscle) and black (nuclei) signals were excluded from analyses. Collagen-positive pixel areas were identified by setting the signal threshold to 140 units to obtain the percentage of collagen-positive pixels relative to the total image area. To determine the tissue area, images were converted to 8-bit format and the signal threshold was set to 180 units; the area was then measured. The final collagen percentage was obtained by dividing the calculated collagen-positive pixel area of the tissue by the total tissue area of the image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec36"&gt;H&amp;amp;E staining&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staining was performed following the Hematoxylin and Eosin Stain Kit protocol (Vitroview, VB-3000). In brief, frozen tissue slides were fixed in cold 80% methanol (Sigma, 179337-1L) at 4 °C for 5 min. The slides were then placed in room temperature PBS for 10 min, followed by a rinse in running deionized water for 2 min. Next, slides were placed in Mayer’s Hematoxylin Solution for 5 min and then rinsed in running tap water for 5 min; placed in 95% ethanol for 1 min and then eosin solution for 1 min 30 s; and dehydrated by being placed in two changes of 95% ethanol for 2 min each, and two changes of 100% ethanol for 2 min each. The tissues were cleared in xylene (Sigma, 214736-1L) for 5 min, three times, and finally mounted with Cytoseal 60 (EMS, catalogue no. 18007) and sealed with a cover glass.

The total histological score ranged from 0 to 10 and was derived from the sum of four scoring criteria: mucosal ulceration, epithelial hyperplasia, lamina propria mononuclear infiltration and lamina propria neutrophil infiltration. Mucosal ulceration scoring criteria were either normal (0), surface epithelial inflammation (1), erosions (2) or ulcerations (3). Epithelial hyperplasia scoring criteria were either normal (0), mild (1), moderate (2) or pseudopolyps (3). Lamina propria mononuclear infiltration scoring criteria were either normal (0), slightly increased (1) or markedly increased (2).

Tissues were crushed using manual dissociation on dry ice and incubated in Pierce RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher, catalogue no. 89900) for 20 min. Following a freeze–thaw cycle, hydroxyproline extraction was performed following the manufacturer’s protocol with a few modifications (Sigma, MAK463-1KT). Fifty microlitres of lysates were incubated with 50 µl of 10 N NaOH for 2 h at 100 °C under constant agitation. Samples were allowed to cool to room temperature, then neutralized by addition of 50 µl of 10 N HCl, diluted 1:1 with 150 µl of water, and centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; at room temperature to remove any particulates. Lysates were transferred to new tubes. A hydroxyproline standard (range: 0–50 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) was then prepared, and 20 µl of each standard and tissue lysate were transferred to individual wells on a 96-well plate (Corning, catalogue no. 29444-018). A reaction mixture containing 8 µl of reagent A and 90 µl of oxidation buffer was prepared for all samples, and 90 µl of this mixture was added to each well, followed by 10 min of incubation at room temperature. Then, 90 µl of reagent B was added to all wells, and the contents of the wells were mixed by pipetting up and down until turbidity dissipated. The plate was incubated for 90 min at 37 °C, after which the optical density of each well was measured at 560 nm on a BioTek Synergy H4 Hybrid Multi-Mode Microplate Reader. To quantify the amount of hydroxyproline, the optical density values of the standards were plotted against their concentrations. Each sample’s optical density measurement was then divided by the slope of the standard curve to yield a hydroxyproline concentration in micrograms per millilitre. Values were normalized to protein concentrations determined by measurements from a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec39"&gt;Protein concentration determination&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total protein concentrations were determined using a Pierce BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher, catalogue no. 23225) on prepared tissue lysates with a few modifications. A standard curve with Pierce BSA standard (Thermo Fisher, catalogue no. 23209) was prepared (range: 0–10 µg µl&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) using individual wells of a 96-well plate, and 1 µl of sample was added to each well. A reaction mixture was then prepared by adding 50 parts of BCA reagent A with 1 part of BCA reagent B, and 200 µl of BCA reaction mixture was added to each well of the 96-well plate, followed by incubation of the plate for 30 min at 37 °C. The optical density of each well was measured at 562 nm on a BioTek Synergy H4 Hybrid Multi-Mode Microplate Reader. Each sample’s optical density measurement was then divided by slope of the standard curve to yield a protein concentration in micrograms per microlitre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec40"&gt;Mouse colon dissociation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mouse colons were dissociated following a modified protocol&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 62" title="Morral, C. et al.

Following acute or chronic DSS treatment, mice were euthanized, and colons were placed in ice-cold HBSS (Thermo Fisher, catalogue no. 14170112). Colons were cut longitudinally and then cut into small pieces. The tissue was then placed in 15 ml of epithelial cell solution (10 mM HEPES (Thermo Fisher, catalogue no. 15630080), 0.5 M EDTA (Thermo Fisher, catalogue no. AM9260G), 100 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; penicillin–streptomycin, 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; DNase I (Roche, catalogue no. 10104159001) in HBSS). Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and manually shaken every 5 min. After incubation, samples were placed on ice for 10 min. Tissue pieces were then transferred to new tubes with HBSS and vigorously shaken for 40 s. The supernatant was collected by filtering through a 100-μm cell strainer (Corning, catalogue no. 352360) into a new tube, and pieces of tissue were placed in the original tube. Shaking and filtering were performed a further two times to dissociate and deplete this epithelial fraction. The remaining tissue was placed in HBSS and washed with gentle shaking three times, for 30 s each time. With a razor blade, the tissue was cut into smaller pieces and transferred to a new tube containing 10 ml of lamina propria solution (100 U ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; penicillin–streptomycin, 100 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Liberase (Sigma, catalogue no. 5401127001), 100 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; DNase I in RPMI). Tissues were incubated 37 °C for 20 min. Manual pipetting with a 5-ml pipette was used to break apart the tissue. The tissue was then incubated at 37 °C for a further 10 min, followed by manual pipetting with a 1-ml pipette to break apart the tissue further until dissociation. Samples were transferred to ice, and 1 ml of FBS and 80 μl of EDTA were added to stop the digestion reaction. Tissue samples were pipetted again with a 1-ml pipette and filtered with a 40-μm cell strainer (Corning, catalogue no. 352340). HBSS was added, and cells were spun down at 400&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 10 min.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec41"&gt;Cell surface staining of colonic cells&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isolated colonic cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in PBS with 2% FBS. Cells were then Fc blocked (BioLegend, catalogue no. 101320) on ice for 10 min at 1 μg per 100 ml buffer. Without removal of the Fc block, a master-mix of fluorophore-conjugated antibodies diluted 1:200 each in PBS with 2% FBS was added to the cells for 30 min on ice (APC anti-mouse CD45 (BioLegend, catalogue no. 157605), PE/Dazzle 594 anti-mouse TER-119 (BioLegend, catalogue no. 116243), Brilliant Violet 421 anti-mouse PDGFRA (BioLegend, catalogue no. 135923), PE anti-mouse PECAM1 (BioLegend, catalogue no. 102407), Brilliant Violet 711 anti-mouse EPCAM1 (BioLegend, catalogue no. 118233) and LIVE/DEAD Fixable Near IR (780) viability stain (Thermo Fisher, L34992)). Cells were spun at 500&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; for 3 min and washed with PBS. This spin and wash was repeated; then, cells were resuspended in live cell sorting buffer (PBS with 5% FBS, 25 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA) and sorted on a Sony SH800 cell sorter. Single-antibody stains for each fluorescent channel using compensation beads (Beckman Coulter, B22804) were used to set up compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec42"&gt;Cell culture&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primary colon fibroblasts (CRL-1459), and immortalized fibroblasts (CRL-4001) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Lenti-X 293T cells for lentivirus production were obtained from Takara (catalogue no. 632180). Primary-monocyte-derived macrophages were from isolated from healthy donor blood (unpurified buffy coats, 25–50 ml; ages within 18–65 years, unknown distribution of male and female) were collected at Research Blood Components, LCC, MA, USA, after a signed consent form had been obtained. Standard testing for blood-borne pathogens was performed. THP-1 Cas9-expressing cells were a gift from the Genomics Platform of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Commercially purchased cell lines were authenticated by the American Type Culture Collection with short tandem repeat identification. No authentication of Lenti-X 293T cells was provided by Takara, nor were donor or donated cells authenticated. All cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma except donor-derived cells, which were not tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibroblasts and Lenti-X 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalogue no. 10569044) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS (MilliporeSigma, F2442), 1× penicillin–streptomycin (Corning, 30-002-CI). Myeloid cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, catalogue no. 22400-089) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1× penicillin–streptomycin.

Isolated cells were washed with PBS before being plated in RPMI-1640 containing recombinant M-CSF (PeproTech, catalogue no. 300-25) for 7 days on non-treated petri dish plates (Falcon, catalogue no. 351029). For polarization to different macrophage subsets, on day 6 following monocyte isolation, attached macrophages were washed with PBS and incubated with macrophage-polarizing ligands for 24 h (see Supplementary Data &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09907-x#MOESM6"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; for concentrations and catalogue numbers). For differentiation of THP-1 Cas9 monocytes into adherent macrophages, cells were stimulated with 300 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; phorbol myristate acetate (Invivogen, tlrl-pma) for 3 h at 37 °C on non-treated petri dishes. Cells were then washed in PBS and reseeded on tissue-culture-treated plates for 2 days in RPMI-1640.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec44"&gt;Cell stimulation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibroblasts were first seeded on a multiwell tissue-culture plate.

Oligos were annealed and phosphorylated using T4 ligation buffer (New England Biolabs, M0202L) and T4 PNK (New England Biolabs, M0201L). Esp3i-digested (Thermo Fisher Scientific, FD0454) pXPR_003 or pXPR_502 for CRISPRko or CRISPRa, respectively, were then ligated with annealed oligos using quick ligase (New England Biolabs, M2200L). Plasmids were transformed into One Shot Stbl3 chemically competent &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific, C737303), single colonies were selected, and DNA was extracted using a spin miniprep kit (Qiagen, catalogue no. 27106). Correct integration of gRNA sequences was verified by Sanger sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec55"&gt;Lentivirus production&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lenti-X 293 cells were seeded and transfected with a combination of psPAX2 (Addgene, catalogue no. 12260), VSV-G (Addgene catalogue no. 8454), and CRISPRko or CRISPRa vectors in Opti-MEM I reduced serum media (Thermo Fisher catalogue no. 31985088) and complexed to Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalogue no. 11668019). After 16 h of incubation of cells with the multiplasmid complex, media were replenished, and cells were allowed to grow for 48 h. Media were then collected and spun to remove debris, and the supernatant containing lentivirus was frozen at −80 °C. &lt;i&gt;IL11&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;mNG&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Cas9 or dCas9–VP64 fibroblasts were stably infected with lentivirus-containing gRNAs targeting the gene of interest. Cells were then selected using puromycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A11138-03) and blasticidin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec56"&gt;Ribonucleoprotein knockout&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knockout cells were generated with gRNA–Cas9 electroporation, following the recommendations of the manufacturer (Integrated DNA Technologies). In brief, a synthesized gRNA for the gene of interest was obtained through Integrated DNA Technologies and resuspended in water. The ribonucleoprotein complex was formed by incubating 120 pmol gRNA with PBS and 104 pmol of Alt-R Cas9 enzyme (Integrated DNA Technologies, catalogue no. 1081058) at room temperature for 20 min. Cells were electroporated with the resultant ribonucleoprotein complex using a Lonza 4D-Nucleofector X Unit kit with SE Cell Line 4D-Nucleofector X Kit S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec57"&gt;Small interfering RNA&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predesigned small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligomers were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and resuspended in nuclease-free water at 20 μM (scrambled control (Sigma, SIC001), &lt;i&gt;FRA1&lt;/i&gt; (Sigma, SASI_Hs01_00191186), &lt;i&gt;TEAD1&lt;/i&gt; (Sigma, SASI_Hs01_00031302), &lt;i&gt;TEAD3&lt;/i&gt; (Sigma, SASI_Hs01_00090158)). Seeded fibroblasts were transfected with 150 pmol siRNA complexed with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Thermo Fisher, catalogue no. 13778030) in Opti-MEM media (Thermo Fisher, catalogue no. 31985062). Twenty-four hours later, cells were reseeded into 12-well plates and plated in triplicate knockdown per condition; another 24 h later, cells were washed with PBS and replenished with fresh media with or without addition of 10 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; of human TGFβ and IL-1β for 24 h. Cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in TRIzol reagent for RNA isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec58"&gt;Fibroblast and macrophage co-culture&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On day 6 after M-CSF treatment of primary human monocytes, differentiated macrophages were polarized with agonists for 24 h (for concentrations, see Supplementary Data &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09907-x#MOESM6"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;). Following removal of agonist and several washes in PBS, fibroblasts were seeded with the macrophages for 24 h. For experiments using THP-1 macrophages, following 2 days of rest after phorbol myristate acetate stimulation, fibroblasts were seeded on to the differentiated THP-1 macrophages, and agonist was added to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For qPCR-based measurements of fibroblasts in co-culture, fibroblasts were seeded at the bottom of a 24-well plate, with macrophages separated through a transwell insert (Corning, catalogue no. 3462). Following co-culture, macrophages were removed, and RNA was isolated from fibroblasts as described above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec59"&gt;Immunofluorescence staining&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec60"&gt;Monoculture of fibroblasts&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells were seeded on a coverglass (Celltreat, catalogue no. 229173) in a 12-well tissue-culture dish. After completion of the experiment, they were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, followed by three washes in PBS for 5 min each time. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, washed in PBS for 5 min, blocked with 4% BSA–PBS and incubated with 1:500 Flag antibody (MilliporeSigma, F1804-200UG) or 1:500 collagen 6 antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, PA5-106556) in 4% BSA–PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed again with PBS and incubated with a 1:1,000 dilution of AF-647-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-21235) or a 1:1,000 dilution of AF-594 anti-rabbit antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-21207) in 4% BSA–PBS for 1 h. Finally, cells were washed three times in PBS, rinsed in distilled water, and mounted with ProLong Diamond Antifade Mountant with DAPI on to a glass slide for 24 h. Images were captured on a Nikon Ti2-E inverted microscope equipped with a CSU-W1 spinning disc confocal system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec61"&gt;Co-cultures of fibroblasts and macrophages&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibroblasts and THP-1 macrophages were prestained with fluorescent labelling dyes before co-culture. In brief, differentiated macrophages were labelled with CellTracker Orange CMRA Dye at 10 µM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, C34551) for 30 min at 37 °C in serum-free RPMI-1640 medium. Cells were then washed in PBS and seeded on to a coverglass in a 12-well dish in complete RPMI-1640 overnight. The following day, adherent fibroblasts were labelled with CellTracker Blue CMAC Dye at 10 µM (Thermo Fisher Scientific, C2110) for 30 min at 37 °C in serum-free RPMI-1640 medium. Cells were then washed, trypsinized and seeded on to the labelled macrophages along with macrophage-activating ligand FSL-1 (1 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;; Invivogen, tlrl-fsl) overnight. Immunofluorescent staining was performed as above (‘Monoculture of fibroblasts’). Images were captured on a Nikon Ti2-E inverted microscope equipped with a CSU-W1 spinning disc confocal. Cells were then washed with PBS and imaged again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIJI imaging quantification software (v.1.54p) was used to quantify the fluorescence intensity of AF-647-labelled nuclear &lt;i&gt;GLIS3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3xF&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;lag&lt;/sup&gt; or AF-594-labelled collagen 6. The median fluorescence intensity of AF-647-labelled nuclear &lt;i&gt;GLIS3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3xF&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;lag&lt;/sup&gt; was quantified in each individual fibroblast nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec62"&gt;Statistics and reproducibility&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism v.10. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for comparisons among three or more groups. Two-way ANOVA was used to compare factorial groups. For Tukey’s, Dunnet’s and Dunn’s multiple-comparison tests, the family-wise error rate was set to a level of 0.05 (95% confidence interval). Multiplicity-adjusted &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; values less than 0.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. All experiments were repeated at least twice as successful, independent experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec63"&gt;CRISPR screens&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lentivirus stocks of the Brunello CRISPRko and Calabrese CRISPRa libraries were obtained from the Genomics Platform of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. Viral titres were calculated using a puromycin selection assay in which a target multiplicity of infection of 0.3 was selected so that each individual fibroblast could be targeted with one gRNA. &lt;i&gt;IL11&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;mNG&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Cas9 or &lt;i&gt;IL11&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;mNG&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Cas9–VP64 fibroblasts were infected with the determined titres of the CRISPRko or CRISPRa libraries, respectively, at 500× representation of each library for 24 h in DMEM supplemented with 10 µg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; polybrene (MilliporeSigma, TR-1003-G). Fibroblasts were washed in PBS the following day, then incubated with 1 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; puromycin and 3 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; blasticidin in DMEM for 3 days. Following selection, fibroblasts were reseeded and expanded under selection. Expanded fibroblasts were then reseeded in DMEM with no selection for 24 h; following attachment, they were washed with PBS and stimulated with a dual combination of TGFβ and IL-1β (10 ng ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; each) in DMEM for 24 h. After stimulation, fibroblasts were detached with trypsin, washed in PBS and resuspended in live cell sorting buffer (PBS with 5% FBS, 25 mM HEPES, 1 mM EDTA), and the top and bottom 15% of &lt;i&gt;IL11&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;mNG&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; fibroblasts were sorted on a Sony SH800 cell sorter (see Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09907-x#Fig11"&gt;6a&lt;/a&gt; for the gating strategy).

Sonicated lysates were spun down and quantified for total protein and DNA using a BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalogue no. 23225), with measurement of absorbance at 260 nM (A260). Equal lysate concentrations were then brought up to 900 µl in low-ionic-strength chip dilution supplemented with 1 mM DTT (Thermo Fisher Scientific, R0861), and 4 µl of either IgG control (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 14-4714-82) or Flag antibody (MilliporeSigma, F1804-200UG) was added to the appropriate sample with rotation overnight at 4 °C. Following incubation, Pierce Protein G Magnetic Beads (Thermo Fisher, catalogue no. 88847) were added, followed by incubation for another 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were separated from the solution and washed twice with low-ionic-strength ChIP dilution buffer, once with high-salt buffer, once with LiCl, and finally twice with TE buffer following previously published methods&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 74" title="Tian, B., Yang, J. &amp;amp; Brasier, A.

Pooled eluates were then decross-linked overnight at constant rotation at 65 °C by addition of decross-linking buffer. Following incubation, 50 μg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; RNase A (Qiagen, catalogue no. 19101) was added for 1 h at 65 °C; then, 0.4 mg ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; proteinase K (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM2548) was added to digest proteins for 4 h at 65 °C. DNA was then extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalogue no. 15593031) extraction, and the DNA pellet was concentrated in a 2× volume of 100% ethanol, 1 μl of glycoblue coprecipitant (Thermo Fisher, AM9516) and 0.1× volume of sodium acetate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, AM9740). DNA pellets were spun down, washed in 75% ethanol, and resuspended in water. Samples then underwent library preparation for ChIP–seq using the KAPA HyperPrep Kit (Roche, catalogue no. 07962363001), following the manufacturer’s protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Library yield was quantified using the dsDNA-specific assay Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Q33231). The size distribution of libraries was determined by Agilent 4200 TapeStation analysis (Agilent, G2991BA). Barcoded sample libraries at equimolar concentrations were pooled and paired-end sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq 2000 Sequencing System with NextSeq 2000 P3 Reagents Kit (200 cycles) (Illumina, catalogue no. 20040560), following the manufacturer’s instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec75"&gt;GLIS3&lt;sup&gt;3xF&lt;/sup&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allergies can be a serious thing, with some of the most serious allergies leading to death if they’re not managed swiftly and properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mm-player"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when you have an allergy – especially a food allergy – it’s absolutely vital that you let anyone you’ll be dining with know well ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This allows for everyone to plan accordingly, whilst also keeping you safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all allergy sufferers know this, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for the Thanksgiving host in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1p9yybc/aita_for_laughing_about_a_pretend_allergy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;this story&lt;/a&gt;, his sister-in-law didn’t tell him about her allergy until he was literally cooking the meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read on to find out why he found this highly suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;AITA for laughing about a pretend allergy?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My parents gave up wanting the responsibility of making a Thanksgiving meal about five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My house is big enough to host and I enjoy cooking, so for the past three years the duties have fallen to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I make the turkey, the stuffing, mashed potatoes and gravy and rolls. Others bring sides and things like chips and drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this year, my brother and his wife came into town early and stayed over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this year, something seriously odd was going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mid-morning on Thanksgiving, my sister-in-law wandered into the kitchen while I’m making stuffing. She saw my pile of breadcrumbs, celery, onion and sausage in a bowl, and me sautéing mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said, “What are THOSE for?” I told her they were for the stuffing. She put her hands on her hips and said, freaking out, “You can’t put mushrooms in the stuffing. I’m allergic!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was stupefied. I said, “When did this happen?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And she just looked at me like I was an idiot, so I said, “When did you discover you’re allergic to mushrooms?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She scoffed and said, “I’ve always been allergic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uh-oh. This was news to her brother-in-law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the thing is, when I make my stuffing I like things to be well incorporated, and I always chop the mushrooms small after I sauté them. So they’re not actually apparent in the mix as mushrooms among the other ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I burst out in a laugh and said, “Well, that’s interesting, because you weren’t allergic last year. And you weren’t allergic the year before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She asked me what I meant, and I told her I’d been making stuffing like this every year she’s eaten it, and furthermore she’s raved over it, and had zero allergic reaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe she’s not allergic. Maybe she just thinks she doesn’t like mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yikes! Things did not go well from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;She got mad and went to my brother to tell him, and she told him she wanted to leave – but he wanted to stay. So she spent the entire rest of the day shooting daggers at me with her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were supposed to stay through the weekend but they left Thanksgiving night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I confided in my mom and my sister yesterday and they kind of chuckled and said it’s not my fault, but my brother texted me this morning that I could have just not used the mushrooms, and that I made his wife feel stupid for no reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I maintain I didn’t make her feel anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AITA?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s clear that her mushroom allergy can’t have been severe, since she’s unknowingly been eating mushrooms in the Thanksgiving dinner year after year with no side-effects – and what’s more, she hasn’t told anyone about this allergy until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the way that he handled the situation wasn’t particularly sensitive either, and suggesting that he ‘didn’t make her feel anything’ is really invalidating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a really messy situation, and someone has to back down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s see what the Reddit community made of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This person agreed that if she was allergic, she should have mentioned something previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-679474" src="https://twistedsifter.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load-0.7/images/1x1.trans.gif" alt="Screenshot 2025 12 01 at 13.31.39 Thanksgiving Host Was Hard At Work Preparing Dinner, But Then His Sister In Law Randomly Told Him About A Previously Unknown Allergy" title="Thanksgiving Host Was Hard At Work Preparing Dinner, But Then His Sister In Law Randomly Told Him About A Previously Unknown Allergy" data-lazy-src="https://twistedsifter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-01-at-13.31.39.png"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-679474" src="https://twistedsifter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-01-at-13.31.39.png" alt="Screenshot 2025 12 01 at 13.31.39 Thanksgiving Host Was Hard At Work Preparing Dinner, But Then His Sister In Law Randomly Told Him About A Previously Unknown Allergy" title="Thanksgiving Host Was Hard At Work Preparing Dinner, But Then His Sister In Law Randomly Told Him About A Previously Unknown Allergy"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this Redditor pointed out that she didn’t have to eat the stuffing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-679475" src="https://twistedsifter.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load-0.7/images/1x1.trans.gif" alt="Screenshot 2025 12 01 at 13.32.26 Thanksgiving Host Was Hard At Work Preparing Dinner, But Then His Sister In Law Randomly Told Him About A Previously Unknown Allergy" title="Thanksgiving Host Was Hard At Work Preparing Dinner, But Then His Sister In Law Randomly Told Him About A Previously Unknown Allergy" data-lazy-src="https://twistedsifter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-01-at-13.32.26.png"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-679475" src="https://twistedsifter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-01-at-13.32.26.png" alt="Screenshot 2025 12 01 at 13.32.26 Thanksgiving Host Was Hard At Work Preparing Dinner, But Then His Sister In Law Randomly Told Him About A Previously Unknown Allergy" title="Thanksgiving Host Was Hard At Work Preparing Dinner, But Then His Sister In Law Randomly Told Him About A Previously Unknown Allergy"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And others stuck up for him, saying she was the one in the wrong here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-679476" src="https://twistedsifter.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load-0.7/images/1x1.trans.gif" alt="Screenshot 2025 12 01 at 13.33.35 Thanksgiving Host Was Hard At Work Preparing Dinner, But Then His Sister In Law Randomly Told Him About A Previously Unknown Allergy" title="Thanksgiving Host Was Hard At Work Preparing Dinner, But Then His Sister In Law Randomly Told Him About A Previously Unknown Allergy" data-lazy-src="https://twistedsifter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-01-at-13.33.35.png"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignnone wp-image-679476" src="https://twistedsifter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screenshot-2025-12-01-at-13.33.35.png" alt="Screenshot 2025 12 01 at 13.33.35 Thanksgiving Host Was Hard At Work Preparing Dinner, But Then His Sister In Law Randomly Told Him About A Previously Unknown Allergy" title="Thanksgiving Host Was Hard At Work Preparing Dinner, But Then His Sister In Law Randomly Told Him About A Previously Unknown Allergy"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, people can develop allergies over time – but this would have surely been something she would have told the family about. Being adamant that she’s always been allergic only furthers the confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If she was allergic or even simply didn’t want to eat something, it would’ve been respectful of her to tell the hosts about that ahead of time, so that they could prepare accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, she made Thanksgiving difficult for everyone, through the negative vibes she was giving off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is completely unfair on everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

The need for better respiratory protection during the winter months is clear. It might be found in a practice that dates back thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;The concept of saline nasal irrigation, or bathing the nasal passages with a saltwater solution, is &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2009/1115/p1117.html" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2009/1115/p1117.html"}' href="https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2009/1115/p1117.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;thought to have been&lt;/a&gt; introduced as part of Ayurveda, an alternative medicine system that originated in the Indian subcontinent more than 5,000 years ago. Now, modern science is beginning to demonstrate that this ancient practice really does serve as a surprisingly effective shield against many of the seasonal bugs behind the common cold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;In 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(24)00140-1/fulltext"&gt;a major new study&lt;/a&gt; of nearly 14,000 people funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research in the UK found that using a simple saline-based nasal spray between three and six times a day at the first sign of an infection reduced illness duration by around 20 percent. A &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.annfammed.org/content/23/Supplement_1/7416" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.annfammed.org/content/23/Supplement_1/7416"}' href="https://www.annfammed.org/content/23/Supplement_1/7416" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;follow-up study&lt;/a&gt;, published last year, reported similar benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-VgtPr ekoLDG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;According to Paul Little, a professor in primary care research at the University of Southampton who led both studies, sodium chloride—the chemical name for salt—is capable of stimulating a natural antiviral mechanism within the nose. “The chloride in saline is taken up by the cells of the nose and throat, and converted into hypochlorous acid within these cells which inhibits viral replication,” says Little. “In doing so, the viral load in the nose is reduced.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Archived medical journals reveal that this practice has been examined as part of Western medicine since the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, but has often been treated with a degree of skepticism. During the early stages of the Covid pandemic, many health care professionals dismissed the suggestion that saline nasal irrigation might be able to prevent infections. The technique was &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10312243/"&gt;initially listed&lt;/a&gt; among other debunked therapies on the World Health Organization’s Covid myth buster page, before being later removed as a steady trickle of research began to prove that regular use of saline sprays or irrigation really could limit the effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/01455613221123737"&gt;One study&lt;/a&gt; found that people who practiced saline nasal irrigation for two weeks after testing positive for Covid were more than eight times less likely to be hospitalized, leading to a resurgence of interest among doctors regarding its ability to dampen the effects of other seasonal infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“Clinicians and researchers have started paying increasing attention to saline nasal irrigation because it helps, and it is natural, easy to understand care,” says David Rábago, a physician and professor at Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine. “So far the results of many small studies and a few big ones are that saline nasal irrigation is safe and effective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;As well as blocking viral replication within nasal cells, it appears that saline can increase the activity of a group of white blood cells called neutrophils—which help to fight off pathogens—while also enhancing the ability of mucus to encircle and trap viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;“When perfectly hydrated, the mucus cells make a barrier and envelop a virus, so that you can either swallow it where the [stomach] acid degrades it, or cough it up,” says Amy Baxter, a pediatrician and assistant clinical professor in medicine at Augusta University. “It’s kind of like how soap works; it surrounds the dirt and makes it easier for it to come off because it fully envelopes these little particles.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 16:18:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE9PMmhjazdKTlRYVHRpMkp2bjlkVFhWRElwU1NOWGdXNTZ0Y25uRDJ6Zk9lWXNxZ1IyUVhQdWRPN0pLOHRHbHlQSEpSTWRkZ2lldWZtRXF4NlpQWGhjNU9sMEE5ZzNaZ0hjc2ZqdzNCNkpta3c</guid></item><item><title>您的焦虑可能是由缺乏一种必需营养素引起的- ZME Science</title><link>https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/nutrition-medicine/anxiety-linked-low-brain-choline/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feelings of anxiety plague millions of people every day. The racing heart, the tightening chest, and thoughts spinning like a hamster wheel have become an all-too-familiar state for many. We often treat this as purely a psychological battle. Calm down, try to “rewire” your thoughts and manage your emotions. But a groundbreaking new study suggests we need to look closer at the fuel keeping our brains running.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, a meta-analysis recently published in &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, uncovered a consistent trend in the brains of people with anxiety disorders: they are running low on choline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is the first meta-analysis to show a chemical pattern in the brain in anxiety disorders,” said Jason Smucny, co-author and an assistant professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. “It suggests nutritional approaches — like appropriate choline supplementation — may help restore brain chemistry and improve outcomes for patients.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-our-brains-need-lots-of-things"&gt;Our Brains Need Lots of Things&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Choline is an essential nutrient that is required for optimal health. It’s not a nutrient you hear a lot about, but choline is a heavy lifter in human biology. It’s a critical building block for cell membranes and a raw material for neurotransmitters responsible for focus and memory. Perhaps most importantly for mental health, choline is essential for maintaining myelin, the protective sheath that insulates our nerve fibers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While our livers produce a small amount of it, it’s not nearly enough to meet our daily needs. We have to get the rest from our diet, from foods like eggs, poultry, beans, nuts, and cruciferous vegetables. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not the first time choline has been &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250408-choline-the-underappreciated-nutrient-thats-vital-for-our-brains"&gt;linked to brain health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/science/anxiety-disorder-relaxation-342143123/"&gt;Anxiety disorders&lt;/a&gt; are characterized by “chronically elevated arousal.” This state floods the brain with stress-related hormones like norepinephrine. The researchers propose that this constant state of high alert triggers specific biological processes that actively burn through choline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The theory goes like this: High norepinephrine levels stimulate the repair and growth of myelin. This repair process requires significant amounts of choline. Consequently, the anxiety creates a vicious cycle. The body’s stress response uses up the body’s choline reserves &lt;a href="https://www.zmescience.com/medicine/mind-and-brain/reading-actually-reshapes-your-brain-heres-how-it-changes-your-mind/"&gt;to fix the myelin&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the brain vulnerable to further anxiety, which in turn burns up the remaining choline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is also a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10178732/"&gt;fascinating connection to Omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;. Choline often hitches a ride into the brain on a specific transporter that also carries Omega-3s (specifically DHA). This might explain why fish oil supplements have shown some promise in anxiety treatments — they might be helping to reopen the supply lines for choline.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="so-what-should-you-do"&gt;So, What Should You Do?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before you run out and buy a gallon of supplements, we need to be clear about what the study says versus what it &lt;em&gt;implies&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers didn’t prove that taking a choline pill cures anxiety. They showed that people with anxiety have low brain choline. However, they explicitly state that future studies should look into whether “appropriate choline supplementation could have therapeutic benefit”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study also shifts the anxiety conversation to a more holistic one that also considers nutrition. This research validates the physical reality of what anxiety sufferers feel every day. You aren’t just “worrying too much.” Your brain is quite possibly running a deficit in one important but overlooked ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know yet if increasing choline in the diet will help reduce anxiety. More research will be needed,” Maddock said. He cautions that people with anxiety should not self-medicate with excessive choline supplements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is all the more important given how common anxiety is.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Anxiety disorders are the most common mental illness in the United States, affecting about 30% of adults. They can be debilitating for people, and many people do not receive adequate treatment,” Maddock said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Someone with an anxiety disorder might want to look at their diet and see whether they are getting the recommended daily amount of choline. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/07315724.2015.1080127"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that most people in the U.S., including children, don’t get the recommended daily amount,” Maddock said. “Some forms of omega-3 fatty acids, like those found in salmon, may be especially good sources for supplying choline to the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It might be time to check your diet, consider your nutrition, and realize that calming the mind might start with feeding the brain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-025-03206-7"&gt;was published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Nature Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="c3efdaf2-d799-4c97-957f-d8d775a59378"&gt;Supplying nerves with a fresh supply of mitochondria could curb chronic nerve pain, a new study hints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, conducted with mouse cells, live mice, and human tissues, reveals a previously unsung role of mitochondria, the powerhouses of cells. It shows that support cells within the nervous system can ship mitochondria to the nerves that respond to pressure, temperature and pain. But problems with that shipping process can deplete the nerves' energy reserves, causing them to malfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-seasonal" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p id="c3efdaf2-d799-4c97-957f-d8d775a59378-2" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;Whereas nerves would normally send a signal to the brain in response to some stimulus, dysfunctional nerves "fire sometimes spontaneously, even without stimulation," said senior study author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://anesthesiology.duke.edu/personnel/ji-prof" target="_blank" data-url="https://anesthesiology.duke.edu/personnel/ji-prof" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ru-Rong Ji&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Duke University School of Medicine's Center for Translational Pain Medicine and a professor of anesthesiology and neurobiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="mid-article-leaderboard" class="ad-unit sm:hidden block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall" aria-hidden="true"&gt;"That will drive chronic pain and also will lead to neurodegeneration," Ji told Live Science, "because if you fire like crazy, eventually, that neuron probably will degenerate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study, published Wednesday (Jan. 7) in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_2523613167058452280&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-09896-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fneuroscience%2Fmitochondrial-transfer-into-nerves-could-relieve-chronic-pain-early-study-hints" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09896-x" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-google-interstitial="false" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-09896-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fneuroscience%2Fmitochondrial-transfer-into-nerves-could-relieve-chronic-pain-early-study-hints" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, points to potential new ways of heading off that neuronal breakdown — and one strategy could involve transferring mitochondria directly into nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-89926d0e-d360-43d0-8323-057590e7d34a" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="fresh-mitochondria-reduce-pain-3"&gt;Fresh mitochondria reduce pain&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="97e3c91e-b58b-4abf-9c18-38a1009f0d23"&gt;The research zoomed in on satellite glial cells, unique cells that physically wrap themselves around the "roots" of nerve cells located near the spinal cord. The bodies of these nerve cells cluster together near the spine, and from each cluster, bundles of long fibers extend to different parts of the body, from head to toe. The longest of these fiber bundles belong to the sciatic nerve, which measures just over 3 feet (1 meter) long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sheer length of the fibers poses a "real challenge," because for a nerve to function properly, mitochondria made in the nerve's root must travel down to the end of each fiber, and that in itself requires energy to do, Ji said. That raises a question of how nerves maintain this power-hungry supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-TBvfh3aVJ8Kzfxdvh7wFJc" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-TBvfh3aVJ8Kzfxdvh7wFJc slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists once thought that cells had to make all of their own mitochondria, but in recent years, they have uncovered evidence that cells swap mitochondria. This can occur between &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8527836/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8527836/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cells of the same type&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or between cells of different types, such as between a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11623344/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11623344/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;stem cell and an immune cell&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example. To facilitate the swap, cells construct tiny structures called tunneling nanotubes for the mitochondria to travel through, like spitballs sliding from one end of a straw to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ji and his team wondered whether satellite glial cells might be able to send mitochondria to the nerve cells they encircle — and it turns out that they can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We demonstrate that these cells actually extend these tunneling nanotubes to deliver in the mitochondria. This [finding] is unique in this study," Ji said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-imageGallery-TBvfh3aVJ8Kzfxdvh7wFJc-2mLYOibAyyZbPnPEWIMCvpOv9rzmwNCz" class="slice-container imageGallery-wrapper imageGallery-TBvfh3aVJ8Kzfxdvh7wFJc-2mLYOibAyyZbPnPEWIMCvpOv9rzmwNCz slice-container-imageGallery"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="inline-gallery first-slide-only"&gt;&lt;p class="inline-gallery__count"&gt;Image 1 of 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="inline-gallery__items"&gt;&lt;div class="react-swipeable-view-container"&gt;&lt;div aria-hidden="false" data-swipeable="true"&gt;&lt;div class="items__item"&gt;&lt;div class="item__image-cont"&gt;&lt;div class="image-cont__image"&gt;&lt;figure class="image-wrapped__wrapper" data-bordeaux-image-check="false"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-credit__figcaption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-credit__credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Xu et al.

Later analyses revealed these transports to be mitochondria.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="78154ae3-5a1f-4787-84aa-b85419aa0cc1"&gt;In a series of experiments with mouse cells and human tissues, the researchers took snapshots of the tiny tubes that formed between glia and nerve cells, noting distinct "bulges" that appeared in the tubes as materials traveled through them. By tacking a fluorescent tag onto mitochondria, they were able to track instances in which powerhouses from glial cells made their way into the nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nanotubes were transient structures that broke down soon after a given transfer was complete. Experiments showed that a protein called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=MYO10" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=MYO10" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;MYO10&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was critical to the tubes' construction, helping to extend them out from the glia. But additionally, the mitochondria could sometimes be transferred without the tubes, either inside tiny bubbles released by glia or through special channels that formed between the membranes of the donor and recipient cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In healthy lab mice, the researchers found that disrupting these different modes of mitochondria shipment made the mice more sensitive to pain. That's because it spurred damage in the nerves and caused them to fire abnormally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also looked at mice with various types of nerve damage, such as from exposure to chemotherapy drugs or from diabetes. These nerve-damaging conditions also disrupted the mitochondrial exchange from glia to some degree, and this contributed to nerve pain in the lab mice. Transferring healthy glia into the mice alleviated the pain, though, by providing them with a fresh source of healthy mitochondria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-92bdf826-eff7-4dd7-a75f-9be53c0461f7" class="paywall" aria-hidden="true" data-url="" href="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-new-view-on-glia-3"&gt;A new view on glia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="a9b5a829-93bf-487c-9d47-cd29643d8241"&gt;Notably, nerve damage from diabetes and chemotherapy tends to hit the smallest nerve fibers the hardest, whereas medium and large fibers show more resilience. In the team's experiments, they found that the larger nerve fibers appeared to receive a higher volume of mitochondria from glia, while small fibers got fewer by comparison. In short, it seems that glia have a "preference" toward lending their mitochondria to larger fibers, the study authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is still a puzzle. We don't know why that's the case," Ji said. But nonetheless, it might begin to explain why small fibers are more vulnerable to damage in these conditions, triggering symptoms of numbness, painful tingling or burning in the feet and hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More studies are needed to fully understand how mitochondria are shuttled from glia to nerve cells in health and disease. This fundamental research could pave the way to future treatments for nerve pain, the team thinks. In theory, treatments could be aimed at boosting the activity of satellite glial cells, so they produce and transfer more mitochondria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or alternatively, mitochondria could be harvested from cells grown in the lab, purified, and then injected straight into nerves as a treatment, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="4a8739d8-f515-4039-9b07-66f8d7a4b0f4"&gt;Historically, glia were solely thought of as the glue of the nervous system, providing structural support to neurons by binding them together. But scientists have since uncovered that glia are involved in processes once thought to be handled only by neurons, like memory. And the new study suggests glia may actually be physically plugged into neuronal networks, Ji said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they can transport mitochondria, such a very large organelle, in that tube, then you can transport many other things, right?" he suggested. "That means the neurons and the glial cells, they are much more connected than we thought."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many &lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/A_History_of_Immunology/2xNYjigte14C?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=1&amp;amp;pg=PA18&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;amp;dq=depletion"&gt;believed&lt;/a&gt; Jenner’s vaccine worked because it depleted the body of the specific nutrients the disease needed to thrive. In reality, his concept worked because of the good fortune that cowpox infections &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952791509000922"&gt;provided cross protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup class="article-reference" id="ref-1"&gt;&lt;button&gt;1&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; against smallpox. It would take almost a century to work out how to develop vaccines against other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://worksinprogress.co/print" class="magazine-cta-inline button-magazine-hover-group"&gt;&lt;img src="https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WIP-Cover-Layered-02-1702x1995.png" class="magazine-cta-inline__image"&gt;&lt;div class="magazine-cta-inline__main"&gt;&lt;p class="magazine-cta-inline__title"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Get the print magazine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="magazine-cta-inline__divider"&gt;&lt;div class="magazine-cta-inline__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subscribe for $100 to receive six beautiful issues per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="magazine-cta-inline__button"&gt;Subscribe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stocks of Jenner’s vaccine would &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-1339-5_2"&gt;die out&lt;/a&gt; repeatedly, and needed to be rederived from scratch many times. Keeping a vaccine alive in the nineteenth century was grueling, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X2030668X"&gt;requiring arm to arm chains of transmission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup class="article-reference" id="ref-2"&gt;&lt;button&gt;2&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; just to preserve the material.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The process improved slowly. In the 1840s, doctors invented a method to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X2030668X"&gt;grow the smallpox vaccine virus more safely and reliably on the skin of calves&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup class="article-reference" id="ref-3"&gt;&lt;button&gt;3&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The 1890s saw a method to keep it from spoiling quickly by &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X2030668X"&gt;mixing it with glycerin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4939-2383-0_1"&gt;in the 1940s&lt;/a&gt;, scientists learned how to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X2030668X"&gt;freeze-dry&lt;/a&gt; it to survive heat and long journeys. In the 1960s, the bifurcated needle, with a forked tip that could hold a tiny drop of vaccine, made it possible to use &lt;a href="https://www.zero-pox.info/bigredbook/BigRed_Ch11.pdf"&gt;only a quarter&lt;/a&gt; of the usual dose and helped scale up vaccination. Technological innovations like these made it possible to eradicate smallpox worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jenner’s discovery in the eighteenth century transformed the world. But it also reflected the primitive knowledge and technology of the time. It would take another 90 years for scientists to formulate germ theory. Another half century would pass before Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll invented the electron microscope, allowing scientists to see the virus that caused smallpox for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Two hundred years ago, vaccines were serendipitous; today, they are designed. We can now visualize the structure of pathogens at an atomic level. We can purify and design ingredients, boost our immune response with adjuvants, deliver vaccines in safer packages, and manufacture them in billions of doses. We can track pathogens’ evolution in real time and adapt vaccines to new strains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It has never been easier to develop new vaccines. We are living through a golden age of vaccine development. The future holds even greater breakthroughs, but only if we continue to invest in them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Pasteur and the culture of vaccinology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The smallpox vaccine was serendipitous. It just happened to be the case that a related virus, cowpox, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952791509000922"&gt;could protect against smallpox&lt;/a&gt; and that cowpox was mild enough to be used safely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ninety years after Jenner, Louis Pasteur worked out how to replicate his success for other diseases. Pasteur was already famous for his &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/1097-0061%2820000615%2916%3A8%3C755%3A%3AAID-YEA587%3E3.0.CO%3B2-4"&gt;fermentation&lt;/a&gt; techniques and developing the process now called &lt;a href="https://digital.sciencehistory.org/works/5tiuqnz"&gt;pasteurization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the 1870s, he began to study infections in farm animals, starting with chicken cholera.&lt;sup class="article-reference" id="ref-4"&gt;&lt;button&gt;4&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; He grew the bacteria in the lab and kept them alive via ‘serial passage’, transferring them to fresh broth every few days, and injecting them into chickens to study the disease. Fresh cultures were &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2264103/pdf/brmedj05026-0035.pdf"&gt;lethal&lt;/a&gt;: nearly all the chickens died within days.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the summer of 1879, while Pasteur was away, &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23328363"&gt;his assistant Émile Roux continued the work&lt;/a&gt;. Roux tried reculturing flasks that had stood for weeks, but the broth had soured, and the bacteria grew poorly. He then injected it into chickens and noted that some survived. Perhaps the bacteria had become too weak to cause disease? But surprisingly, when he injected the same chickens with a fresh, deadly strain, some survived; it had somehow protected them. When Pasteur returned, they continued experimenting, gradually learning that acidity and prolonged exposure to air could weaken the microbe and protect the chickens. With this, they &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2264103/pdf/brmedj05026-0035.pdf"&gt;developed&lt;/a&gt; the world’s second vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then they developed another, against animal anthrax, this time &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23332044?seq=6"&gt;inactivating the bacteria with chemicals&lt;/a&gt;, before turning to one of the deadliest diseases: rabies. Almost everyone who developed symptoms from a rabid animal’s bite died within weeks, but its microbial cause was unclear. The rabies virus, like other viruses, was too small to be seen under microscopes of the time. But Pasteur and Roux reliably found that brain tissue from a rabid animal could cause rabies in another animal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After hundreds of experiments, they finally developed a vaccine. Roux &lt;a href="https://www.columbia.edu/itc/history/rothman/COL476C4947.pdf"&gt;extracted&lt;/a&gt; brain tissue from a rabid dog and injected it into the brains of rabbits after drilling a small hole into their skulls. He then passaged the material from rabbit to rabbit this way, eventually going through 90 rabbits in a row. Finally, he dried the tissues in closed flasks to weaken the pathogen and injected the material into dogs, gradually exposing them to higher and higher doses, helping them build up protection.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the animal experiments seemed successful, Pasteur and Roux &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-1339-5_6"&gt;moved to treat people&lt;/a&gt; who had been bitten by rabid animals, helping their bodies build up antibodies before the disease could fully take hold. In 1885, they treated two young boys bitten by rabid dogs and saw their first indications that the procedure worked. One of the deadliest diseases had become preventable. Rabies would eventually be &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/around-world/index.html"&gt;eliminated&lt;/a&gt; in many countries with vaccines built on their idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their methods could be used to develop vaccines systematically. One way was to force a pathogen into a different environment until it lost its virulence (‘&lt;a href="https://clinicalinfo.hiv.gov/en/glossary/live-attenuated"&gt;attenuation&lt;/a&gt;’); another was to use heat or chemicals to inactivate the pathogen (‘&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7189890/"&gt;inactivation&lt;/a&gt;’). Both prevented pathogens from causing disease in humans while preserving their structure, so the immune system could recognize a similar pathogen in the event of future exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But protecting large populations was still a distant prospect. Pasteur developed vaccines by culturing microbes in whole animals, which was inefficient and &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-74854-2_2"&gt;carried contamination risks&lt;/a&gt;. It was essential to find a way to cultivate cells – not entire tissues or animals – in a lab.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Robert Koch, a bacteriologist and Pasteur’s rival, would make a major advance. While Pasteur fermented microbes in liquid broth, Koch wanted to cultivate bacteria on solid media to see them under the microscope. His solution was to &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1128/9781555818272.ch11"&gt;solidify nutrient broth in a dish with gelatin&lt;/a&gt; and cover it with a bell jar. The gelatin was later replaced by agar (a jelly-like material derived from seaweed) and the bell jar was &lt;a href="https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/210666#page/313/mode/1up"&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; with an additional lidded dish in an invention by his assistant Julius Petri, creating what is now known as the ‘Petri dish’. Paired with Pasteur’s methods, tools like these helped support a wave of research and the development of new bacterial vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But scientists still couldn’t cultivate animal cells. They &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-74854-2_1"&gt;clumped together&lt;/a&gt; on a plate, ran out of nutrients, and quickly died. And as viruses are &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-1108-7_9"&gt;obligate parasites&lt;/a&gt;, requiring living cells to replicate, they couldnʼt be cultivated this way at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next step forward came from neuroscientist &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.1090010503"&gt;Ross Harrison in 1907&lt;/a&gt;, who developed the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3516892/"&gt;hanging drop method&lt;/a&gt;. He took a piece of spinal cord from a frog embryo and put it in a drop of its plasma, placed it on a thin glass coverslip, inverted it over a concave slide, and sealed it with wax – creating a drop that hung suspended and stayed moist and rounded while the plasma provided nutrients and structure. The nerve fibers stayed alive, &lt;a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/589f6511db29d6b160f930bc/t/5cba8f7255b7eb00016c8928/1555730294568/Harrison%2C+1910.pdf"&gt;growing for weeks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hanging-drop-1024x263.png" alt="" class="wp-image-13087" srcset="https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hanging-drop-1024x263.png 1024w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hanging-drop-300x77.png 300w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hanging-drop-768x198.png 768w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hanging-drop-1536x395.png 1536w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hanging-drop-2048x527.png 2048w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hanging-drop-402x103.png 402w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hanging-drop-462x119.png 462w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hanging-drop-662x170.png 662w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hanging-drop-722x186.png 722w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hanging-drop-982x253.png 982w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hanging-drop-1032x265.png 1032w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hanging-drop-1402x361.png 1402w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hanging-drop-1702x438.png 1702w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/hanging-drop-2002x515.png 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By the 1920s, scientists were isolating cells from tissue, watching them migrate across glass surfaces and, once they had used up the nutrients on a plate, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1082475/"&gt;cutting the growing regions&lt;/a&gt; and transferring them onto a new plate, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3516892/"&gt;creating longer lineages of cells&lt;/a&gt;. Such methods helped develop &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/enders-robbins-weller-lecture.pdf"&gt;vaccines against diseases like polio&lt;/a&gt; as scientists figured out &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1676381"&gt;how to propagate poliovirus&lt;/a&gt; in cells outside the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additional &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-74854-2_1"&gt;technologies&lt;/a&gt; made the process safer: antibiotics reduced bacterial contamination, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoclave"&gt;autoclaves&lt;/a&gt; sterilized instruments with high-pressure steam. Later, cryopreservation helped freeze cells for long term storage, and animal broths were replaced with simpler preparations like &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1751011?seq=3"&gt;Harry Eagle’s medium&lt;/a&gt;, which contained only glucose, amino acids, salts, and vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers also developed machinery to grow cells. For cells that typically grew suspended in liquid, there were &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioreactor"&gt;stirred-tank bioreactors&lt;/a&gt;, which bubble in oxygen and stir the solution to distribute nutrients. For those that still required a surface, there were &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcarrier"&gt;microcarriers&lt;/a&gt;, with tiny beads suspended in liquid, and the &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.91.2354.148"&gt;roller bottle system&lt;/a&gt;, where glass bottles rotate slowly to increase cells’ surface area while keeping them evenly bathed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vaccinology had become a systematic science, based ultimately on the foundations laid by Pasteur. By the mid-twentieth century, scientists were producing vaccines against typhoid fever, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, influenza, polio, yellow fever, and other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;The microscope revolution&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What was remarkable about Pasteur’s approach was that he developed some vaccines without ever observing the pathogens, through empirical testing alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t strictly necessary to see pathogens to develop vaccines for them, but observation made others possible. Take tuberculosis, whose symptoms are easy to confuse with other diseases. The bacteria that cause it were eventually identified through microscopy. Without such careful examination, it would have been difficult to cultivate the right bacteria and remove other contaminating microbes from a vaccine preparation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/companionencyclo0001unse_i6n9"&gt;microscopes had been undergoing a revolution&lt;/a&gt; of their own. Over two hundred years, their resolution would improve more than ten thousandfold, allowing scientists to examine not only cells, but bacteria, then viruses, their protein structure, and, eventually, the individual atoms that comprised them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 1800, the French anatomist Xavier Bichat had &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/traitdesmembra1816bich/page/n5/mode/2up"&gt;classified the body into&lt;/a&gt; groups of similar cells, like muscle or connective tissue, using only a hand lens. Bichat &lt;a href="https://numerabilis.u-paris.fr/partenaires/chn/docpdf/generality.pdf"&gt;distrusted&lt;/a&gt; nineteenth century compound microscopes, probably for good reason. Many apparent discoveries of the time were actually caused by &lt;a href="https://microscope-antiques.com/hxachromatic.html"&gt;optical problems&lt;/a&gt; like spherical aberration, where the edges of a curved lens bent light differently than the center and made images blurry, or chromatic aberration, where different wavelengths were bent differently and created colored fringes around objects. What looked like a cellular feature might simply be a distorted lens.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-distortions-1024x831.png" alt="" class="wp-image-13089" srcset="https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-distortions-1024x831.png 1024w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-distortions-300x243.png 300w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-distortions-768x623.png 768w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-distortions-1536x1246.png 1536w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-distortions-2048x1661.png 2048w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-distortions-402x326.png 402w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-distortions-462x375.png 462w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-distortions-662x537.png 662w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-distortions-722x586.png 722w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-distortions-982x797.png 982w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-distortions-1032x837.png 1032w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-distortions-1402x1137.png 1402w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-distortions-1702x1381.png 1702w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-distortions-2002x1624.png 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Various innovations were needed to make microscopes more precise. One step came in 1830 from the wine merchant JJ Lister, who studied lens making as a hobby.&lt;sup class="article-reference" id="ref-5"&gt;&lt;button&gt;5&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; By varying the distance between lenses, &lt;a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rstl.1830.0015"&gt;he worked out&lt;/a&gt; how to develop achromatic and aplanatic lenses, which reduced color and spherical aberrations, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Improvements continued, along with new techniques to view more biological material for longer and with greater detail. Scientists developed &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/principlesofbiol01bake"&gt;better fixatives&lt;/a&gt; to stabilize cells and prevent them from decaying, &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/principlesofbiol01bake"&gt;staining dyes&lt;/a&gt; that bind to molecules to reveal structures like the cell nucleus, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microtome"&gt;sectioning equipment&lt;/a&gt;, which cut tissue into thin slices to allow light through.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the nineteenth century progressed, scientists began to see cells’ organelles and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11180163/"&gt;observe cell division&lt;/a&gt;. They increasingly recognized cells as &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncb0599_E13"&gt;the units that all living organisms are made of&lt;/a&gt;. And with improvements in culture methods, they observed microorganisms – bacteria, fungi, and parasites – infecting cells and causing disease.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most famous was the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/em&gt;, discovered &lt;a href="https://germanhistory-intersections.org/en/knowledge-and-education/ghis:document-25"&gt;by Robert Koch in 1882&lt;/a&gt;, at a time when tuberculosis was killing &lt;a href="https://edoc.rki.de/handle/176904/5172"&gt;thousands&lt;/a&gt; each year in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1353829299000295"&gt;growing cities&lt;/a&gt; like Berlin. Before Koch, researchers had managed to &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/community.24801815"&gt;reproduce&lt;/a&gt; tuberculosis in rabbits by injecting them with phlegm from infected patients, but struggled to identify its microbial cause. Although they didn’t know it, the bacteria’s waxy cell walls, rich in mycolic acids, repelled water-based dyes, making the bacteria difficult to stain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Visualizing them would take ingenuity. Taking lung tissue from an autopsy, Koch applied standard dyes and then added &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1128/9781555818272.ch14"&gt;ammonia&lt;/a&gt;, making the solution more alkaline. It made it possible for the dyes to attach to the bacteria, and as the dyes latched on, they revealed, at last, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14600233/"&gt;the pathogen responsible&lt;/a&gt; for one of humanity’s greatest killers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His discovery was part of a surge of research in microbiology in the late nineteenth century, now known as the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971210023143"&gt;golden age of microbiology&lt;/a&gt;. One by one, long standing mysteries of diseases – tuberculosis, cholera, typhoid, anthrax, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, meningococcal and pneumococcal disease – were being resolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No viruses had yet been observed: they were still invisible under the microscope, being much smaller than bacteria. Unfortunately, by the end of the nineteenth century, improvements in microscopy were reaching a hard limit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The physicist and businessman Ernst Abbe had &lt;a href="https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/221236/1/Peckham_2024_J._Phys.__Conf._Ser._2877_012091.pdf"&gt;formulated an equation&lt;/a&gt; that would explain why. He found that a microscope’s optical resolution depended on the wavelength of light and the numerical aperture of the lens (a measure of its ability to gather light). Light microscopes couldn’t focus at high magnification because, no matter how clear the lenses were, they couldn’t distinguish details closer than about half the wavelength of visible light, roughly two hundred nanometers. When two points were closer together, light waves directed at them would interfere, blurring them into a single spot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It would take until the 1930s for physicists Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll to &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/ruska-lecture.pdf"&gt;invent&lt;/a&gt; the electron microscope, replacing light with electrons, which have a smaller wavelength, and extend this limit. Their invention required &lt;a href="https://api.pageplace.de/preview/DT0400.9781483284651_A23884248/preview-9781483284651_A23884248.pdf"&gt;various advances&lt;/a&gt;: discovering the electron, inventing magnetic lenses, and improving vacuum technology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Electron microscopy combined them all. Electrons can’t be bent by glass the way light can, so electron microscopes instead use magnetic lenses: coils of wire carrying current that bend and focus the electron beam. To keep the electrons from scattering off, the instrument operates in a vacuum. The pieces work in &lt;a href="https://www.thermofisher.com/blog/atomic-resolution/seeing-with-electrons-the-anatomy-of-an-electron-microscope/"&gt;stages&lt;/a&gt;: a source produces the electron beam; a condenser aperture shapes it; magnetic lenses focus it progressively onto a specimen; and more lenses project and magnify the image onto a detector.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscopes-electron-light-1024x979.png" alt="" class="wp-image-13095" srcset="https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscopes-electron-light-1024x979.png 1024w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscopes-electron-light-300x287.png 300w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscopes-electron-light-768x735.png 768w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscopes-electron-light-1536x1469.png 1536w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscopes-electron-light-2048x1959.png 2048w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscopes-electron-light-402x384.png 402w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscopes-electron-light-462x442.png 462w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscopes-electron-light-662x633.png 662w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscopes-electron-light-722x691.png 722w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscopes-electron-light-982x939.png 982w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscopes-electron-light-1032x987.png 1032w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscopes-electron-light-1402x1341.png 1402w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscopes-electron-light-1702x1628.png 1702w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscopes-electron-light-2002x1915.png 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first electron microscopes were fragile prototypes. Improving the vacuum seal, brightening the beam, sharpening the lenses, and using better cameras led to an enormous payoff: magnification thousands of times greater than light microscopy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-resolution2-01-755x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-13172" srcset="https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-resolution2-01-755x1024.png 755w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-resolution2-01-221x300.png 221w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-resolution2-01-768x1042.png 768w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-resolution2-01-1132x1536.png 1132w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-resolution2-01-1510x2048.png 1510w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-resolution2-01-402x545.png 402w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-resolution2-01-462x627.png 462w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-resolution2-01-662x898.png 662w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-resolution2-01-722x979.png 722w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-resolution2-01-982x1332.png 982w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-resolution2-01-1032x1400.png 1032w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-resolution2-01-1402x1902.png 1402w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-resolution2-01-1702x2309.png 1702w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/microscope-resolution2-01-2002x2716.png 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 755px) 100vw, 755px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Electron microscopy gave microbiologists their &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-virology-100520-014520"&gt;first direct look at viruses&lt;/a&gt;, finally revealing their geometry. But the electron beam could &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/advanced-chemistryprize2017.pdf"&gt;collapse&lt;/a&gt; biological material like proteins and membranes, leaving mere outlines and shadows. It would take until the 1980s for scientists to see the precise internal structure of viruses, with the &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/advanced-chemistryprize2017.pdf"&gt;invention of cryo-electron microscopy&lt;/a&gt;. Here, a thin film of the sample would be plunged into a very cold liquid so fast that water solidified without forming ice crystals. This glass-like water, called vitreous ice, locked molecules in place in their native structure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With time, scientists developed &lt;a href="https://communities.springernature.com/posts/smaller-than-the-space-between-atoms-the-technology-behind-the-highest-resolution-microscope-image"&gt;better detectors&lt;/a&gt; and computational methods to combine overlaps from thousands of images to reconstruct the 3D structure of microbes down to their individual &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-virology-101416-041921"&gt;atoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Take respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. In the last decade, visualizing the atomic structure of its proteins helped finally &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11898631/"&gt;develop safe and effective vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, decades after &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4305198/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4783420/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;efforts&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4305199/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;failed&lt;/a&gt;. The critical site was a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4459498"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt; on its surface, the fusion protein, which helps the virus enter cells. The protein changes shape after it enters cells, by which point it’s too late: even if our immune system could recognize it, it wouldn’t matter. But its pre-fusion shape, &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; it enters, is a powerful target. After scientists could see its structure with crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, they used &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4461862/"&gt;genetic engineering&lt;/a&gt; to mutate the protein and lock it in its pre-fusion shape for a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Precision vaccines&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The RSV vaccine was also part of a major shift in vaccine technology: it was not the whole virus but an individual protein. Until the mid-twentieth century, the vast majority of vaccines had been made from whole pathogens. Making precise vaccines, containing only a few key ingredients, would improve their safety and widen their breadth. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This approach gradually replaced the Pasteurian method of culturing and weakening a microbe. The first step came in 1890, only a few years after Pasteur’s breakthrough, when the doctors &lt;a href="https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/kjm1952/40/1/40_1_35/_pdf"&gt;Emil von Behring and Kitasato Shibasaburo&lt;/a&gt; discovered ‘&lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1901/behring/article/"&gt;serum therapy&lt;/a&gt;’. By passively transferring the serum of an infected person or animal to someone else, they could prevent or treat the latterʼs infection. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their serum therapy tamed diphtheria, whose victims, &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4587476?seq=2"&gt;typically young children&lt;/a&gt;, could die of suffocation within days. The bacteria release a toxin that kills throat cells, causing our body to respond by laying a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/article-abstract/181/Supplement_1/S116/837949"&gt;tough, clot-like membrane&lt;/a&gt; that can inadvertently seal the airway and choke us. Unfortunately, serum therapy gave only &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/1181518"&gt;fleeting&lt;/a&gt; protection: whatever was in the serum didn’t teach the immune system to recognize and remember the pathogen later on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over three decades later, researchers &lt;a href="https://www.pasteur.fr/en/research-journal/news/diphtheria-hundred-years-ago-first-toxoid-vaccine"&gt;developed&lt;/a&gt; an active, longer-lasting vaccine against diphtheria by &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/261378"&gt;inactivating&lt;/a&gt; the bacteriaʼs toxins using &lt;a href="https://www.academie-sciences.fr/pdf/eloges/ramon_notice.pdf"&gt;formalin&lt;/a&gt;, while maintaining their ability to stimulate an immune response. Diphtheria cases fell dramatically. It was the first example of what we now call a ‘subunit vaccine’, containing only a particular part – in this case the inactivated toxin – of the bacterium.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though serum therapy was being replaced by vaccines, it had also given scientists a key insight: serum carried protective factors that could defend someone against pathogens they had encountered before. Those protective factors included &lt;a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/how-to-make-an-antibody/"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt;, which attach to particular parts of the pathogen, called ‘antigens’.&lt;/p&gt;






        

    



&lt;p&gt;Researchers developed a growing set of tools to detect and quantify antibodies. What they found was remarkable: antibodies weren’t just vaguely anti-foreign, they were highly specific. Tiny differences in the molecular structure of an antigen could lead to entirely different immune responses, as the doctor &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1930/landsteiner/biographical/"&gt;Karl Landsteiner&lt;/a&gt; discovered when he &lt;a href="https://digitalcommons.rockefeller.edu/ru-authors/132/"&gt;worked out&lt;/a&gt; the chemical basis of blood groups. But how could the body possibly &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4331447?seq=2"&gt;generate so much diversity and specificity&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One theory, the ‘instructional’ model, was &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ja01867a018"&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; by Linus Pauling. He suggested that the microbe acted as a template, molding the shape of the nascent antibody to fit it. This seemed to explain the high specificity of the interactions at first. But with more data, &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/48752648?seq=1"&gt;the model broke down&lt;/a&gt;. Just a single unit of an antigen could generate millions or even billions of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8966904/"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt; that were exact copies of one another, not what you’d expect if they all required contact. And some were present even before exposure to an antigen, like the natural antibodies people have against other blood groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gradually, the field shifted toward another model, &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.41.11.849"&gt;proposed by Niels Jerne&lt;/a&gt;, which suggested that antigens weren’t reshaping antibodies: &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev.iy.04.040186.000245"&gt;they were being recognized by a pre-existing antibody repertoire&lt;/a&gt;. This was refined into ‘&lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/clonalselectiont00burn/page/58/mode/2up"&gt;clonal selection theory&lt;/a&gt;’ by Macfarlane Burnet in 1957: each white blood cell expresses a unique antibody, and when it finds a matching antigen, clones of that white blood cell multiply and release thousands of antibodies per second. The massive diversity of white blood cells, researchers later found out, isn’t encoded from birth –  the DNA of developing white blood cells is &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5089068/"&gt;actively cut, shuffled, and stitched back together&lt;/a&gt; during our lifetimes into &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7153836/"&gt;tens of millions&lt;/a&gt; of unique antibody-producing cells, generated continuously after birth, waiting for the right antigen to come along.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-1024x899.png" alt="" class="wp-image-13105" srcset="https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-1024x899.png 1024w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-300x264.png 300w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-768x675.png 768w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-1536x1349.png 1536w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-2048x1799.png 2048w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-402x353.png 402w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-462x406.png 462w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-662x582.png 662w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-722x634.png 722w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-982x863.png 982w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-1032x907.png 1032w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-1402x1232.png 1402w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-1702x1495.png 1702w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/clonal-selection-2002x1759.png 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This extreme specificity meant the immune system didn’t need the entire pathogen to trigger a response, but only a part of it, the right antigen, to recognize it in the future. It laid the groundwork for an entirely different approach to developing vaccines or improving existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One example was the vaccine against &lt;a href="https://vaccineknowledge.ox.ac.uk/pertussis-whooping-cough#Key-disease-facts"&gt;pertussis&lt;/a&gt;, or whooping cough, a disease that leaves infants and young children violently gasping for breath. Pertussis &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.4161/hv.29576"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt; were developed back in 1914, and their rollout massively reduced the spread of the disease. But they also contained the whole bacterial cell and could cause rare side effects. The &lt;em&gt;Bordetella pertussis&lt;/em&gt; bacterium has &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK220494/"&gt;thousands of antigens&lt;/a&gt;, and injecting vaccines containing the whole bacterium meant injecting unnecessary material. Rising concern about the safety of the vaccine led to lawsuits in the United States and, in Japan, the government suspended it. As vaccination rates dropped, &lt;a href="https://idsc.niid.go.jp/iasr/18/207/tpc207.html"&gt;pertussis cases and deaths rose&lt;/a&gt;, spurring an international research effort to develop a better vaccine: one that contained only the antigens necessary for protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yuji and Hiroko Sato, a husband and wife team working at the National Institute of Health in Japan, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10600185/"&gt;found two such antigens&lt;/a&gt;: pertussis toxin and filamentous hemagglutinin. They purified and detoxified them with formalin. The resulting vaccine became part of the diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine, which was &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d42859-020-00013-8"&gt;introduced in Japan in 1981&lt;/a&gt; and later adopted globally.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More and more vaccines have been developed with this approach, as scientists have sifted through pathogens to find only key antigens that are needed for a subunit vaccine. As they’ve replaced older vaccines, the&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK220494/"&gt; number of antigens&lt;/a&gt; that children receive in childhood vaccines has &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7173515/"&gt;fallen sharply&lt;/a&gt;. Children receive more vaccines today, but fewer and more targeted antigens than they did back in 1900, when only the smallpox vaccine was widely available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subunit vaccines have many &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118870914"&gt;advantages&lt;/a&gt;. Without the entire pathogen, there are fewer contaminants, fewer unnecessary antigens, and fewer side effects. They can also easily contain antigens from multiple pathogens, protecting people from all of them at once. But stripping vaccines down to a few components can also come at a cost: the acellular pertussis vaccine, for example, was safer but also less effective, with immune protection &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5710106/"&gt;waning&lt;/a&gt; after a few years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the twentieth century, immunologists discovered new ways to restore the potency that subunit vaccines had lost. They found ‘&lt;a href="https://press.asimov.com/articles/adjuvants"&gt;adjuvants&lt;/a&gt;’, such as aluminium salts and oil-based emulsions, that could dramatically strengthen the immune response. They also learned that the way a vaccine’s antigens are presented, the structure, formulation, and delivery, could shape immunity. Step by step, scientists learned to recreate the strength of whole-pathogen vaccines with the safety of their purified descendants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The genomic revolution&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new era began when scientists stopped merely cultivating viruses and began decoding them. Over the last 50 years, genome sequencing has grown faster and cheaper, and genetic engineering has become ever more precise: the blueprints of pathogens have become both readable and editable, making it possible to rapidly redesign vaccines to match an evolving world of microbes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the 1970s, it took &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-genom-111919-082433"&gt;weeks or months&lt;/a&gt; to laboriously decode the sequence of a single gene. Even in the 1980s, after automated sequencers were introduced, it took days per gene. But by the 2010s, &lt;a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-genom-111919-082433"&gt;propelled by the Human Genome Project&lt;/a&gt;, scientists could read entire genomes in the same amount of time with new sequencers, at a tiny fraction of the cost. Since then, some sequencing devices have been made so compact they can be &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21495-usb-stick-can-sequence-dna-in-seconds/"&gt;plugged into a computer like a USB stick&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-842x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-13190" srcset="https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-842x1024.png 842w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-247x300.png 247w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-768x935.png 768w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-1262x1536.png 1262w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-1683x2048.png 1683w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-402x489.png 402w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-462x562.png 462w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-662x806.png 662w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-722x879.png 722w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-982x1195.png 982w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-1032x1256.png 1032w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-1402x1706.png 1402w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-1702x2071.png 1702w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/genome_seq_cost2-01-2002x2436.png 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 842px) 100vw, 842px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists can now compare thousands of strains to one another and analyze how changes in a virus’s genetic code weaken it. They found, for example, that only &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC521805/"&gt;a handful of mutations&lt;/a&gt; were needed to attenuate the poliovirus into a vaccine that doesn’t invade nerve cells or cause paralysis. By experimenting and tweaking it further, scientists developed a &lt;a href="https://europepmc.org/article/pmc/pmc7566161"&gt;new, more stable oral polio vaccine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sequencing can also help identify better genes to use as vaccine targets. Genes that are conserved across multiple strains of a virus can help make a vaccine that protects against them all; genes encoding proteins on a virus’s surface make for better immune recognition. This approach of finding antigens through genetics, known as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3633180/"&gt;reverse vaccinology&lt;/a&gt;, produced the first effective meningitis B vaccine in 2013. Finally, sequencing has enabled scientists to track evolving viruses like influenza and Covid-19 in real time in order to update their vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alongside these advances, scientists learned to transfer and edit genes between organisms, turning &lt;a href="https://worksinprogress.co/issue/animals-as-chemical-factories/"&gt;cells into tools of manufacture&lt;/a&gt;. In the 1970s, biologists Paul Berg, Stanley Cohen, and Herbert Boyer developed methods to &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.69.10.2904"&gt;combine DNA&lt;/a&gt; from different organisms. This method, called &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Recombinant-DNA-Technology"&gt;recombinant DNA technology&lt;/a&gt;, involved cutting DNA with restriction enzymes and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC427208/"&gt;pasting it into vectors&lt;/a&gt;, transforming bacteria, yeast, or insect cells into miniature factories that can produce proteins like &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC382885/"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt; in bulk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This solved another problem that subunit vaccines had. In the past, developing them required purifying proteins from viruses grown in eggs or tissues, which was laborious, gave low yields and could contain contaminants. Recombinant DNA technology replaced this process. It helped Maurice Hilleman, who made &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Vaccinated-Defeat-Worlds-Deadliest-Diseases/dp/006122796X"&gt;over 40 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; in his lifetime, develop the first recombinant &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-1339-5_25"&gt;hepatitis B vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. It contained only one key surface protein from the virus and was far easier to manufacture than previous versions of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also helped develop the first human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, which contains copies of a protein from the outer shell of the virus. When expressed in yeast or insect cells, these proteins &lt;a href="https://laskerfoundation.org/winners/hpv-vaccines-for-cancer-prevention/"&gt;spontaneously assemble&lt;/a&gt; into hollow ‘virus-like particles’ that resemble the real virus but contain nothing inside. The immune system responds as though they are genuine viral invaders, giving it the ability to respond swiftly if it encounters the real virus later on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recombinant DNA technology can also combine targets from multiple microbes. The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaa621"&gt;HPV vaccine Gardasil-9&lt;/a&gt;, for example, protects against nine virus strains by including a key antigen from the surface of each one. In doing so, it &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/hpv-vaccination-world-can-eliminate-cervical-cancer"&gt;protects people&lt;/a&gt; from a wide range of HPV infections that can cause cancers of the cervix, vagina, vulva, penis, anus, head and neck.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-1024x992.png" alt="" class="wp-image-13115" srcset="https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-1024x992.png 1024w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-300x291.png 300w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-768x744.png 768w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-1536x1488.png 1536w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-2048x1984.png 2048w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-402x389.png 402w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-462x448.png 462w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-662x641.png 662w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-722x699.png 722w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-982x951.png 982w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-1032x1000.png 1032w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-1402x1358.png 1402w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-1702x1649.png 1702w, https://wip.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/vaccine_03-HPV-virus-2002x1940.png 2002w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not all proteins self-assemble and many arenʼt easy to manufacture this way. Viruses typically use our own cells’ machinery to make their proteins, which assemble in specific ways for the virus to multiply. But viral proteins can end up processed &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06121-4"&gt;incorrectly&lt;/a&gt; when grown in recombinant bacteria or yeast, since they have different machinery. To make recombinant vaccine proteins, scientists often spend years experimenting and optimizing the protein’s shape and structure to develop a vaccine, with each protein requiring its own long optimization process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A better idea is to bypass microbial factories entirely and make cells in our own&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;body produce the proteins for a vaccine. In the 1990s, scientists tried making &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1545867/"&gt;DNA vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for this purpose, with circular plasmid DNA to deliver the instructions into muscle so it could make vaccine proteins. The idea was promising in animals but inefficient in humans: &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4955855"&gt;DNA struggles to enter cells&lt;/a&gt; and an even smaller fraction would reach the nucleus for this idea to work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4624045/"&gt;more direct route&lt;/a&gt; is to use mRNA, which can be translated straight away by our protein-making machinery outside the cellʼs nucleus. mRNA is also transient, producing a protein we can recognize before disappearing itself. But it also triggers strong immune reactions, is chemically fragile before it enters cells, easily destroyed by enzymes. Step by step, these obstacles were overcome: first, in 2005, when the scientists &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2023/press-release/"&gt;Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman&lt;/a&gt; developed a method to tweak it and make it less visible to the immune system, and then in 2014, when Weissman and other researchers developed &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525001617301119"&gt;‘lipid nanoparticle’ systems&lt;/a&gt; to carry, protect, and deliver the mRNA safely into cells.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result was a rapid, adaptable platform that could be redesigned almost as quickly as new threats emerged: because it &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41573-021-00283-5#Sec1"&gt;bypasses microbial factories&lt;/a&gt; entirely, each new vaccine can be formulated and updated &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2622-0"&gt;within weeks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 230 years since Jenner’s discovery, vaccine technology has changed inconceivably, and many diseases that plagued humanity are mostly forgotten. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It has become far easier and faster to develop new vaccines. Microbes that were once invisible to us can now be observed at an atomic level. Vaccines were once cultured in animals, then tissues, then cells, and now their individual proteins can be built in microbial factories. They can be engineered to be safer and more precise than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Biology has had golden ages in the past, as scientists rapidly discovered new microbes, antibiotics, and drugs: microbiology’s &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/erasinepidemiolo0000suss"&gt;golden age&lt;/a&gt; developed in the late nineteenth century, while &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/golden-age-antibiotics"&gt;antibiotic development&lt;/a&gt; had a golden age in the mid-twentieth century. Meanwhile, vaccine development has actually sped up; in the last five years alone, scientists have developed the first effective vaccines against four additional diseases. If we invest in them, the future holds many more. The golden age of vaccine development lies ahead of us.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A new year might mean new viral threats. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Old viruses are &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/bird-flu-could-be-on-the-cusp-of-transmitting-between-humans-but-there-are-ways-to-slow-down-viral-evolution-250232"&gt;constantly evolving&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/58-of-human-infectious-diseases-can-be-worsened-by-climate-change-we-scoured-77-000-studies-to-map-the-pathways-188256"&gt;warming and increasingly populated planet&lt;/a&gt; puts humans in contact with more and different viruses. And increased mobility means that viruses can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20201479"&gt;rapidly travel across the globe&lt;/a&gt; along with their human hosts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an &lt;a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7003-018X"&gt;infectious diseases physician and researcher&lt;/a&gt;, I’ll be keeping an eye on a few viruses in 2026 that could be poised to cause infections in unexpected places or in unexpected numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Influenza A – on the cusp of a pandemic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Influenza A is a perennial threat. The virus infects a wide range of animals and has the ability to mutate rapidly. The most recent influenza pandemic – caused by the H1N1 subtype of influenza in 2009 – killed &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(12)70121-4"&gt;over 280,000 people worldwide in its first year&lt;/a&gt;, and the virus continues to circulate today. This virus was often called &lt;a href="https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/history/h1n1-flu-pandemic-2009"&gt;swine flu&lt;/a&gt; because it originated in pigs in Mexico before circulating around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most recently, scientists have been monitoring the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2025.06.007"&gt;highly-pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 subtype&lt;/a&gt;, or bird flu. This virus was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02209-24"&gt;first found in humans in southern China&lt;/a&gt; in 1997; wild birds helped spread the virus around the world. In 2024, the virus was found for the first time in &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/avian-flu-has-infected-dairy-cows-in-more-than-a-dozen-states-a-microbiologist-explains-how-the-virus-is-spreading-235526"&gt;dairy cattle in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently became &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07849-4"&gt;established in herds in several states&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;

            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Avian flu has spread across dairy herds in the U.S.&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/humans-infecting-animals-infecting-humans-from-covid-19-to-bird-flu-preventing-pandemics-requires-protecting-all-species-212679"&gt;crossover of the virus&lt;/a&gt; from birds to mammals created major concern that it could become adapted to humans. Studies suggest there have already been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7344a3"&gt;many cow-to-human transmissions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2026, scientists will continue to look for any evidence that H5N1 has changed enough to be &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/bird-flu-could-be-on-the-cusp-of-transmitting-between-humans-but-there-are-ways-to-slow-down-viral-evolution-250232"&gt;transmitted from human to human&lt;/a&gt; – a necessary step for the start of a new influenza pandemic. The influenza vaccines currently on the market probably don’t offer protection from H5N1, but scientists are &lt;a href="https://asm.org/articles/2025/march/avian-influenza-h5n1-vaccines-what-status"&gt;working to create vaccines&lt;/a&gt; that would be effective against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mpox – worldwide and liable to worsen&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mpox virus, formerly called monkeypox virus, was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.277.5324.312"&gt;first discovered in the 1950s&lt;/a&gt;. For many decades, it was seen rarely, primarily in sub-Saharan Africa. Contrary to its original name, the virus mostly infects rodents and occasionally &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1053/j.spid.2004.09.001"&gt;crossed over into humans&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mpox is closely related to smallpox, and infection results in a &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-mpox-a-microbiologist-explains-whats-known-about-this-smallpox-cousin-236857"&gt;fever and painful rash&lt;/a&gt; that can last for weeks. There are &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-025-10896-5"&gt;several varieties of mpox&lt;/a&gt;, including a generally more severe clade I and a milder clade II. A vaccine for mpox is available, but there are no effective treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/709003/original/file-20251216-56-e2kqja.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Mpox has spread around the world.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Monkeypox_Virus_(52103767506).jpg"&gt;NIAID/Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"&gt;CC BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41392-023-01675-2"&gt;global outbreak of clade II mpox&lt;/a&gt; spread to more than 100 countries that had never seen the virus before. This outbreak was driven by human-to-human transmission of the virus through close contact, often via sex. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the number of mpox cases has significantly declined since the 2022 outbreak, &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/mpox-worldwide-overview"&gt;clade II mpox has become established&lt;/a&gt; around the world.  Several countries in central Africa have also reported an &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON587"&gt;increase in clade I mpox cases&lt;/a&gt; since 2024. Since August 2025, &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2025/10/17/california-mpox-strain-cases/86748970007/"&gt;four clade I mpox cases have occurred in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt;, including in people who did not travel to Africa. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unclear how mpox outbreaks in the U.S. and abroad will continue to evolve in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Oropouche virus – insect-borne and poised to spread&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oropouche virus was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.1961.10.574"&gt;first identified in the 1950s&lt;/a&gt; on the island of Trinidad off the coast of South America. The virus is carried by mosquitoes and small &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.32473/EDIS-IN626-2025"&gt;biting midges, also known as no-see-ums&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people with the virus experience &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/oropouche-virus-disease"&gt;fever, headache and muscle aches&lt;/a&gt;. The illness usually lasts just a few days, but some patients have weakness that can persist for weeks. The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41541-022-00456-2"&gt;illness can also recur&lt;/a&gt; after someone has initially recovered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/708999/original/file-20251216-56-y06wxk.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Biting midges – which carry Oropouche virus – are hard to see, as their alias ‘no-seem-ums’ implies.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CSIRO_ScienceImage_11052_Biting_midge_on_human_skin.jpg"&gt;CSIRO via Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"&gt;CC BY-SA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many unanswered questions about the Oropouche virus and the disease it causes, and there are no specific treatments or vaccines. For decades, infections in people were thought to occur only in the Amazon region. However, beginning in the early 2000s, cases began to show up in a larger area of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11908-025-00862-2"&gt;South America, Central America and the Caribbean&lt;/a&gt;. Cases in the United States are usually among travelers returning from abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2026, Oropouche outbreaks will likely continue to affect travelers in the Americas. The biting midge that carries Oropouche virus is found throughout North and South America, including the southeastern United States. The &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41541-022-00456-2"&gt;range of the virus&lt;/a&gt; could continue to expand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Even more viral threats&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A number of other viruses pose a risk in 2026. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chikungunya"&gt;global outbreaks of chikungunya virus&lt;/a&gt; may affect travelers, some of whom may want to consider getting vaccinated for this disease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/canada-loses-its-official-measles-free-status-and-the-us-will-follow-soon-as-vaccination-rates-fall-269090"&gt;Measles cases continue to rise&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. and globally against the backdrop of &lt;a href="https://hub.jhu.edu/2025/06/03/united-states-measles-vaccination-rate-declines/"&gt;decreasing vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/hiv-knows-no-borders-and-the-trump-administrations-new-strategy-leave-americans-vulnerable-an-hiv-prevention-expert-explains-264871"&gt;HIV is poised for a resurgence&lt;/a&gt;, despite the availability of effective treatments, due to &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/cutting-hiv-aid-means-undercutting-us-foreign-and-economic-interests-nigeria-shows-the-human-costs-253705"&gt;disruptions in international aid&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;

            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Despite the availability of effective treatments, diseases like HIV and measles are seeing resurgences.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://newsroom.ap.org/detail/KenyaHIVCareatRisk/9c0d755d2ff04779980860f0e2183f97/photo"&gt;Brian Inganga/AP Photo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as-yet-undiscovered viruses can always emerge in the future as &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/future-pandemics-will-have-the-same-human-causes-as-ancient-outbreaks-lessons-from-anthropology-can-help-prevent-them-224622"&gt;humans disrupt ecosystems and travel&lt;/a&gt; around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the world, people, animals and the wider environment are &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/humans-infecting-animals-infecting-humans-from-covid-19-to-bird-flu-preventing-pandemics-requires-protecting-all-species-212679"&gt;dependent on each other&lt;/a&gt;. Vigilance for known and emerging viral threats and the development of new vaccines and treatments can help keep everyone safe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

The cat went in for testing on Jan. 2 and was confirmed to have it on Jan. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terri McCollister, the rabies program manager with DPH, recommends people keep their distance from stray and feral cats since they can carry diseases like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wlos.com/news/local/henderson-county-officials-bat-encounters-urge-safety-measures-hendersonville-department-public-health-summer-camps-wildlife-commission-tested-rabies-avoid-contact" target="_blank"&gt;HENDERSON COUNTY OFFICIALS WARN OF RISING INDOOR BAT ENCOUNTERS, URGE SAFETY MEASURES&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you see an animal in need, watch it from a distance and contact someone trained in handling animals, such as your local animal control officer, wildlife control operator, or wildlife rehabilitator," McCollister said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you or someone you know came into contact with this cat, the DPH asks you to call the Greenwood office at 864-942-3600.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case involving the cat follows another &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/rabid-cow-confirmed-anderson-county-19-livestock-exposed" target="_blank"&gt;case announced on Jan. 5&lt;/a&gt;, where a beef cow in Anderson County tested positive for rabies and exposed 19 other cows to the deadly virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cow was found near Gentry Road and Highway 81 in Starr, South Carolina, and went in for testing on Dec. 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wlos.com/news/local/south-carolina-measles-outbreak-surpasses-200-cases-department-public-health-update-quarantine-schools-exposure-locations" target="_blank"&gt;SOUTH CAROLINA MEASLES OUTBREAK SURPASSES 200 CASES&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No people are known to have been exposed in this case.

The gorgeous Golden actually rolled his eyes to emphasize his displeasure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The look on his face spoke volumes.

																			&lt;p class="tagline"&gt;These simple bed exercises can be stellar indicators of strength.&lt;/p&gt;
												
																			
																		
						
						
						&lt;p&gt;Your bed is not just for relaxing anymore. It’s time to wake up and get ready for a workout! &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/bed-exercises-trim-waist-overhang-after-50/" target="_blank"&gt;Bed exercises&lt;/a&gt; are extremely effective for &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/how-to-build-muscle-density-and-boost-strength/" target="_blank"&gt;boosting strength&lt;/a&gt;, flexibility, circulation, and even your mood. If you’re over 60, this modality is an amazing choice to consider—especially if your mobility is limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bed exercises give your joints and spine solid support. They help your body perform controlled movements that will increase core strength and help to maintain a solid range of motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We spoke with &lt;b&gt;Mario Kiaunis&lt;/b&gt; from &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://mk1personaltraining.com/" target="_blank"&gt;MK1 Personal Training&lt;/a&gt; who shares a fun bed exercise challenge for 60-year-olds. If you can complete four bed exercises without stopping, you’re in elite shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When considering elite fitness for adults over 60, certain bed exercises can be great indicators,” Kiaunis tells us. Below, he breaks down the best ones to weave into your routine.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="dead-bug" class="o-slide-title" data-num="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dead Bug&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This exercise engages the core and helps with coordination, stability, and mobility in the trunk,” Kiaunis explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lie face-up on a workout mat with your arms extended toward the sky and knees lifted and bent to 90 degrees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press your lower back into the floor as you gradually lower your left arm and extend your right leg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return to the center.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, lower your right arm and left leg.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue to alternate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="single-leg-bridge" class="o-slide-title" data-num="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Single-Leg Bridge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This movement works the glutes, hamstrings, and lower back, which are crucial for maintaining strength and posture, while also challenging the core and stabilizing muscles of the non-lifted leg,” Kiaunis says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lie flat on your back with bent knees, feet flat on the floor, and arms at your sides.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press your lower back into the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extend your left leg straight out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press through your right heel to lift your glutes off the floor and toward the ceiling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Squeeze your glutes at the top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lower with control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat on the other side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This exercise is fantastic for building core strength, as it requires the entire abdominal region to stabilize the body and maintain the position,” Kiaunis tells us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lie flat on your back with your arms extended overhead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press your lower back into the bed while lifting your legs and shoulders off the surface, maintaining a slight curve with your body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

	&lt;h2 id="side-lying-leg-lift" class="o-slide-title" data-num="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Side-Lying Leg Lift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jgh6sGwtTwk?si=ekkxRe9-VpoFLqQw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This exercise works the hip abductors, muscles that are important for maintaining lateral stability and balance,” Kiaunis says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lie on one side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lift your top leg upward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hold it for a moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slowly lower.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat on the other side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These bed exercises are important because they help maintain strength and mobility, which are essential for everyday tasks. As people age, it’s important to keep muscles flexible and strong to avoid injuries and improve balance,”  Kiaunis notes. “The ability to perform these movements helps support activities like getting out of bed, walking, and standing up from a chair.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cardiologists say small, everyday habits can slowly harm your heart health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;These include sitting too much, ignoring stress and late-night snacking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They also recommend avoiding excessive alcohol and seeking help quitting smoking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Your heart is essentially your body’s engine. It works tirelessly, beating about 100,000 times a day to help keep you moving, breathing and living.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Yet, for something so vital, many of us take it for granted.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cardiologists have a different take. They know that heart disease is often the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/small-habits-for-heart-health-11796620" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cumulative result of everyday habits&lt;/a&gt; we barely think twice about. The good news? It’s never too late to try and reverse course. Heart doctors don’t expect perfection, but they do wish we would pay closer attention to a handful of habits that can &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7894073/these-7-things-could-make-you-more-likely-to-get-heart-disease-according-to-the-american-heart-association/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;wreak havoc on our cardiovascular systems&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By identifying—and giving up—these common behaviors, they say that you can significantly improve your odds of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/blue-zones-healthy-habits-11791571" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;living a longer, healthier life&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-missing-out-on-movement"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 1. Missing Out on Movement &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The human body was designed to move, yet stillness has become our default mode. Many of us drive to work (or we work from home and don’t even leave the house!). Then, we sit at our desks for eight hours, ride home via car or train, and spend the evening relaxing on the couch to unwind. Unfortunately, your heart pays a steep price for this lack of activity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The most common bad habit I see in my patients is not moving,” says &lt;a href="https://vitalsolution.com/who-we-are/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Bradley Serwer, M.D.&lt;/a&gt; The downside isn’t just gaining weight or feeling sluggish. “A sedentary life has been linked to heart disease and premature death,” he says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fortunately, the fix doesn’t require an expensive gym membership or training for a marathon. It simply requires a shift in mindset to prioritize motion. Find activities you enjoy that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-to-add-movement-limited-time-11772724" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;get your blood pumping&lt;/a&gt;. Then try to make them a regular part of your day. “Go for a walk, ride your bike, swim in the lake, enjoy life,” suggests Serwer. Simple, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8026823/what-is-joyful-movement/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;joyful movement&lt;/a&gt; is often the best medicine.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-underestimating-the-power-of-quitting-smoking"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 2. Underestimating the Power of Quitting Smoking &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Smoking isn’t as common as sedentary lifestyles, so it affects less people, however, smoking is the single worst thing you can do to your body,” says Serwer. The damage it causes is systemic, affecting nearly every part of the cardiovascular system.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Smoking promotes the development of atherosclerosis, increases the risk of forming blood clots, damages your arteries, raises your blood pressure and reduces the oxygen delivery to your body,” he says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, if quitting smoking were easy, far fewer people would light up. Considering that smoking impacts your heart health from multiple angles, stopping is the most powerful step you can take for your heart. If you smoke, speak to your health care provider about resources to help you quit. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-ignoring-stress"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; 3. Ignoring Stress &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We often view stress as a purely mental or emotional struggle—a bad day at the office or a frustrating traffic jam. But your heart doesn’t distinguish between emotional stress and physical danger. While occasional stress is no big deal, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7902105/stress-causing-inflammation-what-you-can-do-about-it/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;chronic stress&lt;/a&gt; triggers a cascade of hormones that can put your body in a state of constant high alert. Over time, this unchecked stress can lead to high blood pressure and even &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-heart-disease-risk-11833680" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;irregular heart rhythms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To complicate matters, stress can act as a gateway to other choices that harm your heart, says Serwer. When you are feeling stressed, you may be less likely to cook a healthy meal or go for a run and more inclined to turn to less-than-healthy habits for comfort. That’s why it’s so important to be proactive and develop strategies to nip stress in the bud before it snowballs. “By dealing with your mental health in a positive manner, you can avoid the negative consequences of these bad habits,” says Serwer. Managing your mental headspace is effectively managing your heart health.

Drinking Too Much Alcohol &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; From happy hours to celebratory toasts, social drinking is deeply ingrained in our culture. While an occasional glass of wine or cocktail is usually harmless, drinking too much can be problematic for your heart, says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-laird-15743934/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;John R. Laird, Jr., M.D&lt;/a&gt;. “Excessive alcohol consumption can raise blood pressure and increase the risk,” he explains. If you’re wondering how much is too much, the American Heart Association recommends &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/alcohol-and-your-health-11685623" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;limiting alcohol&lt;/a&gt; to two drinks a day for men and one for women.&lt;span data-cite="7" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Snacking Late at Night &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We live in an era where food is available 24/7, making it all too easy to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/292223/these-are-the-worst-foods-to-have-before-going-to-bed/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;snack well into the night&lt;/a&gt;. That can spell trouble for your heart in all sorts of ways, says &lt;a href="https://www.wphphysicianassociates.org/provider-directory/providers/muhammad-malik-md/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Muhammad Malik, M.D.&lt;/a&gt; “From a cardiovascular standpoint, this habit is strongly associated with weight gain, insulin resistance, elevated triglycerides and poor blood pressure control,” he explains.&lt;span data-cite="8" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It also works against you in another, less obvious way. “Late-night eating in particular disrupts circadian rhythms and glucose metabolism, leading to worse lipid profiles and higher cardiovascular risk,” he says.&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Breaking old habits can seem daunting, but you don’t have to overhaul your entire life overnight to keep your heart healthy. These actionable strategies can get you started:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor Your Blood Pressure:&lt;/strong&gt; “High blood pressure often shows no symptoms, particularly in the early stages, which is why most people do not realize they have it. It can quietly damage your body for years,” says Laird.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Regular doctors’ visits can give you a good feel for your numbers, but that yearly appointment is only a snapshot in time. For more consistent feedback, consider purchasing a home blood pressure monitor. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add in Soluble Fiber:&lt;/strong&gt; All fiber is good. But soluble fiber is especially advantageous for your heart, helping remove cholesterol from the body before it can clog your arteries. Experts recommend consuming 5 to 10 grams of soluble fiber per day from foods like oats, quinoa, barley, beans, avocados, chia seeds, flaxseed and berries.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schedule Movement:&lt;/strong&gt; Treat your walk or bike ride like a doctor’s appointment and put it on the calendar. You’ll be less likely to forget (or skip) it.  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Focus on Consistency over Perfection:&lt;/strong&gt; You don’t need a strict eating plan that makes you miserable. You need sustainable habits. “Heart-healthy eating is not about perfection or restriction. It’s about patterns and consistency,” says Malik.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protecting your heart health doesn’t require running a marathon or giving up all your favorite foods. It’s about your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai pseudoStyle" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;daily habits&lt;/a&gt;. So, keep the good ones and lose the bad ones. Cardiologists say habits like sitting too much, smoking, ignoring stress, drinking too much alcohol, and late-night snacking can all slowly harm your heart. By addressing even one of these, you can create a positive ripple effect for your overall well-being. Start small, be consistent and remember that every healthy choice is a signal to your heart that you’re in it for the long haul.

A “revolutionary” treatment sold by pharmaceutical company Vertex for $370,000 (£274,000) a year will be available for as little as $2,000 a year from a generic manufacturer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The 99.5% reduction in price is the result of years of parent-led campaigning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Cystic fibrosis, a genetic condition, causes a buildup of mucus in the lungs and digestive system, making it hard to breathe and leaving patients susceptible to infections.

Pledger hopes that an affordable treatment will help find them. “When there’s nothing available, what is the point in diagnosing them?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;As individuals, Pledger says, it is easy to feel powerless. But when families come together “it’s an incredible power, especially mums.

Registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.onceuponapumpkinrd.com/about/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Maggie Michalczyk " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6941aaf3e4b06cf6877f4c25" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.onceuponapumpkinrd.com/about/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;Maggie Michalczyk &lt;/a&gt;said this too, explaining, “Red bell peppers are the highest in vitamin C and A due to longer ripening times, followed by orange, yellow and green.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of which color bell pepper offers the most immune support, red comes out on top again. “Studies show that red bell peppers have the highest content of vitamin C out of all the bell peppers, potentially as high as 60% more vitamin C than their green counterparts,” Lydon shared, highlighting &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16019314/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="a study published in the" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6941aaf3e4b06cf6877f4c25" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16019314/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;a study published in the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;International Journal of Food Science and Nutrition&lt;/a&gt;.

All three dietitians emphasized that the nutritional differences between different colored bell peppers aren’t huge, so you shouldn’t get too hung up on it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Each bell pepper offers a unique antioxidant profile, so it’s best to ‘eat the colors of the rainbow’ when it comes to bell peppers so that you can reap the nutritional benefits of each kind,” Lydon said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;For example, yellow bell peppers are particularly high in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6827103/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="lutein and zeaxanthin" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6941aaf3e4b06cf6877f4c25" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6827103/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="13"&gt;&lt;span&gt;lutein and zeaxanthin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, two nutrients that support eye health. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As for green bell peppers, Hultin said they are lower in calories. “Green bell peppers have slightly fewer calories than their red, orange and yellow counterparts since they are less ripe and their natural sugars haven’t accumulated yet. However, this difference is negligible,” she said. A red bell pepper contains about &lt;a href="https://www.eatthismuch.com/calories/red-bell-pepper-2440" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="37 calories" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6941aaf3e4b06cf6877f4c25" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.eatthismuch.com/calories/red-bell-pepper-2440" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;37 calories&lt;/a&gt; per pepper, while a &lt;a href="https://nutriscan.app/calories-nutrition/green-bell-pepper" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="green pepper contains 24" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6941aaf3e4b06cf6877f4c25" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://nutriscan.app/calories-nutrition/green-bell-pepper" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="15"&gt;green pepper contains 24&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It bears repeating that when it comes to the nutritional differences among bell pepper colors, all three dietitians say these differences are pretty minimal across the board, so it’s important not to get too hung up on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How you cook them matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to get the maximum benefits from your peppers, how you cook them matters. “Steaming and stir-frying are two good ways to cook bell peppers to help prevent the loss of water-soluble vitamins like vitamin C,” Michalczyk said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;She recommends avoiding boiling or cooking bell peppers at high heat to preserve their nutrient density as much as possible. “It’s good to keep in mind that overcooking can degrade nutrients found in vegetables and boiling can cause the water-soluble vitamins to leach into the water,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since vitamin A is fat-soluble, Hutlin recommends sautéing peppers in extra-virgin olive oil to help maximize nutrient absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is no shortage of bell pepper recipes you can find online to experiment with to learn your favorite ways to eat bell peppers. Lydon said that, personally, she loves stuffed bell peppers because they’re easily customizable based on taste preferences and the ingredients you have on hand. “Make it a well-balanced, satisfying meal by adding a source of lean protein like ground turkey, chicken or fish, a starch high in fiber like brown rice or quinoa and a dietary fat like cheese or avocado,” she shared.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Hultin says that bell peppers can be easily mixed into soups, stews, omelettes or frittatas for breakfast, roasted as a side or enjoyed raw and sliced to pair with hummus. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ultimately, all colors of bell peppers make a great addition to the diet, so I wouldn’t stress too much about getting one color vs. the other,” Michalczyk emphasized. “Go for a variety to reap the benefits from the health compounds that are unique to each color. In the winter, during cold and flu season, I think it’s great to know that red bell pepper has more vitamin C than an orange and incorporate those into different meals and snacks to support your immune system.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s also important to remember that bell peppers are just one of many nutrient-rich foods, including ones &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/what-to-eat-to-boost-your-immune-system-this-fall-goog_l_651446c7e4b080568d95dac8" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="that support your immune system.

Besides providing your body with a wider range of nutrients, switching things up will keep your taste buds happy, too.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>HuffPost</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 12:00:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxQY1pKLTRRQ1BuNTkxcmNXWmlFbm9URkhrTzB4RzBsQXVJRlljc3ZWUjhCZEJ1TGpOSGRydHNLOHJpV1FKOFF6NUxNR2g2aTJMLTc1V0luZE1jMjgyRy1yN1VzOUpIdUJZQkRiQWhNeDFDV2xHeHFOTEVpSm1UUFk2TW9BclRlMHV1YUZhWVlvd1ZWRDRE0gGaAUFVX3lxTE5JbU45eDg1dEZpaTN4Um1OTWpMMDhZWEc5eW1RVTNkRTh3VFItdS03LW14T1Y4TkdjeEV2TVl1QUNGb2ZJWW9LQTBsVV9hRGRtel8xeW5yZHNyZFZJQVA2c2ZhVGZGaTgxT21jUVQwekJHUUtjX2hVS0RiN2xaYk9jSGJiLVBrWWJFNHFlMFFSZkhKOWxlZzZNMHc</guid></item><item><title>尽管研究甚少，但公司仍在竞相推向市场自闭症测试-《纽约时报》</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/07/health/autism-tests-skin-hair-antibodies.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 10:01:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNMFdjdFZ6ZnhRdnp1RFowMUFVN0hvRjV4OVcxMHE4Y0dnYnJoejgyS2hzTmRUSHRzaW5Wa01kSzFGODlBQkZpQ3kxUkNOdVV4ejNPMVFEWFRDOWlSZjdqdVNjeU83eGNTRzFEWE9kR203R0Z5LWtXcVRlbGJXNU1GbGZuNThkcVU</guid></item><item><title>我不想失去视力-女性寻求视网膜手术资金-牙买加之星</title><link>https://jamaica-star.com/article/news/20260107/i-don%E2%80%99t-want-lose-my-sight-woman-seeks-funding-retinal-surgery</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQa25JX0dleGFoSUlfSmtFVkFUODQ2Wm93TWtFR0EwWUZxOFJsT3RhR2w4M3lzRC1TNDhTdHRpVlp2MGpjRzQwR3A1VUJmZjc2b2N1aU53XzB0emttM2JkTkZXMjJUWm1heHUwNm96emJIM1NORlFmejBQTm9rRjJTMkJ0b0pqN0Z6QTE4LVBTTHlqSEFmbjV2Nld0b1BZaEpQQzVHb3B4eFh4bUI3SHRYM01UOWFiQ0J1?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;I don’t want to lose my sight - Woman seeks funding for retinal surgery&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;Jamaica Star&lt;/font&gt;</description><author>Jamaica Star</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 10:01:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxQa25JX0dleGFoSUlfSmtFVkFUODQ2Wm93TWtFR0EwWUZxOFJsT3RhR2w4M3lzRC1TNDhTdHRpVlp2MGpjRzQwR3A1VUJmZjc2b2N1aU53XzB0emttM2JkTkZXMjJUWm1heHUwNm96emJIM1NORlFmejBQTm9rRjJTMkJ0b0pqN0Z6QTE4LVBTTHlqSEFmbjV2Nld0b1BZaEpQQzVHb3B4eFh4bUI3SHRYM01UOWFiQ0J1</guid></item><item><title>密歇根州的流感病例激增，以及其他4个主要案例- MLive.com</title><link>https://www.mlive.com/news/2026/01/flu-cases-in-michigan-surge-and-4-other-major-stories.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content   "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="HPKMX2IDAJCKRLUI6L55NV6OLQ"&gt;Influenza is surging in Michigan, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OLLCPFVK4BEGRLPN7MSMQLF7FU"&gt;Insights into his year’s flu season is one of five must-read stories to kick off your morning on Wednesday, Jan. 7. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-heading"&gt;Flu cases surge in Michigan &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QBRRKJLCCJC5NFISXGMO4TVSHM"&gt;Michigan has reached “very high” flu-like illness activity status as of the week ending Dec. 27, according to the CDC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZNPAAHYJUZEGLKYF35R7UPBL6I"&gt;Eighteen states, including Michigan, reported the highest activity levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MS3VHA76TZGBBNRMAVWZS7EIUA"&gt;Read &lt;a href="https://www.mlive.com/news/2026/01/flu-surge-in-michigan-state-reaches-worst-tier-on-cdc-scale.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;&lt;u&gt;reporter Justin Hicks takeaways at this link.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The strain accounts for the prevalent flu strain this season. Health experts are particularly tracking the H3N2 subclade K variant, which is being reported in 90% of cases. The strain is a different variant from the strain in this year’s flu shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-27" data-gaid="inarticle-27"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KSAFDTFJJVCVFCHYLH7LSKQUHY"&gt;The so-called subclade K led to early outbreaks in the United Kingdom, Japan and Canada this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-28" data-gaid="inarticle-28"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FNPZEAXYH5EWHOGSAWQDV462LU"&gt;“There’s no evidence that this new subclade causes more severe disease or results in hospitalizations or death with more frequency,” Goldman said. “However, when you have more flu, you have more people who end up being hospitalized or end up dying simply because if you have a greater number, even if the percentage who end up with severe disease remains the same, if you have more cases, you have more severe disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-29" data-gaid="inarticle-29"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="LEHT535HAVBPLNSWI2MH5Q3MIU"&gt;Because the subclade K is getting around pre-existing immunity from the vaccine or other infections, more people are getting the flu, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-30" data-gaid="inarticle-30"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="PGDJYC6RBFABBIJJBLBMEVQHDI"&gt;Approximately 90% of flu-related deaths and flu-related hospitalizations are seen in people 65 and older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-31" data-gaid="inarticle-31"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="4VWW6GZ3HNHXXO524RTGWL2TXQ"&gt;While the &lt;a href="https://www.pennlive.com/topic/donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.pennlive.com/topic/donald-trump/"&gt;Trump administration &lt;/a&gt;no longer recommends flu shots or &lt;a href="https://www.pennlive.com/health/2026/01/us-cuts-recommended-childhood-vaccines-what-parents-need-to-know.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.pennlive.com/health/2026/01/us-cuts-recommended-childhood-vaccines-what-parents-need-to-know.html"&gt;other types of vaccines for all children, &lt;/a&gt;many health experts are standing by the long-held protocol in this country in favor of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-32" data-gaid="inarticle-32"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MA7WWQYAC5GTLLMJK7ICAX24X4"&gt;“It’s not too late to get the flu vaccine,” Goldman said. “We would recommend the flu shot for everyone. We strongly recommend it for people above the age of 65 and those with pre-existing conditions. And given that the flu season this year is more severe, we’re strongly recommending that if you have not gotten the flu shot yet, you should get it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-33" data-gaid="inarticle-33"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KDRDAQAAUBFPXOKQ47FUNLTYY4"&gt;Early data show this year’s flu vaccine is effective at reducing influenza-related emergency department visits and hospital admissions, officials from the state Department of Health said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-34" data-gaid="inarticle-34"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5NVCT2JHUJFP5ATDYFOY5ZBPU4"&gt;“Public health experts consistently state that the vaccine still provides strong protection against severe illness,” department officials said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-35" data-gaid="inarticle-35"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KYSEEMZJAVDXTAHC7R5ELNC43Q"&gt;How can you tell if what you have is the flu or Covid? There really is only one sure way to determine.

Covid often comes on gradually; while with the flu, people frequently describe feeling like they’ve suddenly been “hit by a dump truck,” Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, told The New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-38" data-gaid="inarticle-38"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="P2DDKRSAFBCCZKWZMRSSZTSMYA"&gt;The only sure way to discern one from the other is to test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-39" data-gaid="inarticle-39"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6CI3YWM7RFH2VKIXZ2Y3AKLWCI"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advice from the doctor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-40" data-gaid="inarticle-40"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="VSPG4QZBXNHNBD6LF36OBZHNN4"&gt;If you are feeling under the weather, stay home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-41" data-gaid="inarticle-41"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RICRHEEF4NFGXAAX24MBJK52JA"&gt;“We all know people who are sneezing, coughing. They look like they have the flu. Stay away from those people,” Goldman said. “Don’t invite them to dinner. If you yourself are sick, then we do recommend that you stay home from work, you stay home from school, and, you know, if you have elderly parents, for example, you don’t go visit them. If you’re young and healthy, getting the flu may not be a big deal for you.

A recent graduate of Kennesaw State University, Reece, then 22, had moved back home to Canton, Ga., in December 2024, and was juggling part-time work, social obligations and the stress of transitioning into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Part of living at home meant sleeping in her childhood twin-size bed, and the mild ache in her collarbone and shoulder seemed easily explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It was the kind of annoying pain you get when you sleep wrong,” Allie tells PEOPLE exclusively. “It wasn’t sharp or constant, and it usually went away by the next day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Over the next several months, the shoulder pain came and went — sometimes after golfing, other times after long walks — but it never lingered long enough to raise concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allie Reece&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allie Reece in April 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Then, in April 2025, her worry spiked. Two weeks after a day on the golf course, she woke with a sharp, stabbing pain in her shoulder blade, unlike anything she had felt before. Alarmed, she went to the emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Initially, doctors suspected a blood clot. But a CT scan revealed something far more serious: a mass in her chest, roughly the size of an orange. Physicians suspected lymphoma, though confirmation would take time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I'll never forget that first moment — it was disbelief,” Reece says. “You hear the word ‘mass,’ and your mind immediately goes to the worst-case scenario. Even knowing it could be treatable, the fear is overwhelming.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allie Reece&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allie Reece in the hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The following day, Reece met with an oncologist, a meeting she recalls as emotionally overwhelming. “I was a wreck,” she says. “Anytime someone would talk to me, I would just start crying. I’m not normally a crier, but for about two weeks, I was completely unstable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Her oncologist explained that the first step would be a fine needle biopsy, which extracts a small sample from the mass for testing. When the results came back benign, Reece’s anxiety only deepened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I ended up having three surgeries because everything kept coming back benign,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Determined to find answers, Reece sought a specialist at Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta. She underwent a cervical mediastinoscopy — a delicate surgery around her heart and lungs — to biopsy three lymph nodes. Yet once again, the results came back benign, prolonging the uncertainty and fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It wasn’t until a PET scan was finally approved that clarity arrived. The images revealed both the mass and an affected lymph node, confirming the presence of cancer cells. Relief mingled with dread — at least now they knew the problem, but the road ahead remained daunting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The next step was a robotic thymectomy,” Reece recalls. “They went in through small incisions under my armpits and along my chest. They deflated my lung to reach the mass, which was wrapped around my heart and lungs. The plan was just a biopsy, but they were able to remove the entire mass.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allie Reece&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allie Reece during chemotherapy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After a week and a half of agonizing waiting, in August 2025, her oncologist delivered the long-awaited confirmation: &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hodgkins-lymphoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352646" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hodgkin’s lymphoma.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Hodgkin’s lymphoma.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“They were very reassuring about the survival rate,” she says. “It’s very common in people our age. She told me, ‘You’re going to be fine. It’s going to be tough for a while, but you should live.’ ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Even with that reassurance, fear lingered. “Until you hear the final pathology results, it’s terrifying,” she says. “You feel like you’re walking on a tightrope every day.” But having a clear path to treatment offered a fragile sense of hope after months of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Right away, Reece, now 23, began an eight-round regimen called ABVD, a standard treatment for Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The side effects were immediate: fatigue, nausea and hair loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Determined to normalize the experience for others, Reece turned to &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@big_.al" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TikTok;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, sharing candid moments from chemotherapy appointments and the emotional journey of &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@big_.al/video/7580969266447387959" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:shaving her head;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;shaving her head&lt;/a&gt; — a story that reached over five million people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I’m 23, dating and suddenly I had to face the fact that I was going to be bald. I wasn’t happy about it at all,” she says. To prepare, she experimented with wigs, ordering several and posting about them online to help other girls facing the same challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;When the time came, she cut her long hair into a lob, thinking shorter hair would be easier to lose — a decision she calls one of her best ideas. As her hair thinned, she collected it in a bag she named Lola, a ritual that gave her a sense of control over something that felt completely uncontrollable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I wanted to show that it’s scary, but it’s doable,” she says. “You don’t have to be crying or miserable. If I can do it, anyone can.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Reece also chose to freeze her eggs through IVF, a process she found intimidating because there weren’t many relatable resources online. “I wanted to make content that could help other girls going through the same thing — it’s scary, but doable. If I can do it, anyone can,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Her openness resonated. Messages poured in from people expressing gratitude, sharing their own experiences, or simply saying, “Thank you for sharing — it helps me feel less alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allie Reece&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allie Reece in the hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Throughout her treatment, she says her family and friends became her backbone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Her mother accompanied her to appointments, managing logistics and providing emotional support. Her brother shaved his head alongside her, while friends organized care packages, drove her to sessions and offered constant encouragement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I couldn’t have done it without them,” Reece says. “They reminded me every day that I wasn’t in it alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, not every day was brave. Reece says some nights, after chemotherapy, she'd lay awake scared and exhausted, overwhelmed by uncertainty. Yet amid the fear, she found moments of resilience and gratitude, especially through her community of over 100,000 followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“There were days I thought, ‘I can’t do this,’ and other days I’d think, ‘I’ve got this,’” she says. “Cancer forces you to slow down and reflect on what matters most.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allie Reece&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allie Reece with her family&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;After completing chemotherapy in December 2025, Reece marked the milestone by ringing the bell at the infusion center — a symbolic end to treatment. Surrounded by family, doctors and nurses, she reflected on the journey: the fear, the pain, the uncertainty and the unexpected joy of perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“That moment was surreal,” she says. “It was a mix of happiness, relief and gratitude. You don’t get to that point without the people around you, cheering you on.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now cancer-free, Reece focuses on wellness, fitness and sharing her story to inspire others. She continues to post updates on social media, offering a glimpse into life after chemotherapy — including challenges, triumphs and the small, everyday moments that feel monumental after what she’s endured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“If my story can make someone feel seen, heard or understood, then it’s worth sharing,” she says. “Cancer changes you, but it doesn’t define you. It’s about what you do after, how you live and who you lift up along the way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Even when symptoms seem minor, don’t ignore them,” she says. “It’s better to check and be safe. Early detection can make all the difference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/23-year-old-diagnosed-with-cancer-after-annoying-shoulder-pain-exclusive-11878456" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo News Canada</author><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jan 2026 09:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPc0QzVHFha0RpYjhDaHNXTi1GS19zRGpVWVBLeF9HeEJ3LXozYVFjS3VzdG03bjg3RFZlNUdrbTIzdlNwRl93RlRYTmZtR2wyeTYxMk40SUxSWFNHV3hfWlVDNHI4bHVkbTFfZjBaMFQ1enotbmtSTUl1VkFGc0R0TW5vbUp6Vmhl</guid></item></channel></rss>
