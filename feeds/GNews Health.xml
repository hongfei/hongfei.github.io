&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly educated night owls showed significant cognitive decline over 10 years, while those with less education were unaffected regardless of sleep preferences&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The problem stems from rigid work schedules forcing night owls into chronic “social jetlag,” creating constant conflict with their natural sleep rhythms&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Poor sleep quality and smoking habits explained about 25% of the brain fog connection, suggesting targeted interventions could help&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRONINGEN, Netherlands —&lt;/strong&gt; Your natural sleep schedule might be quietly damaging your brain, but only if you fall into a specific category of people. A decade-long study of nearly 24,000 adults has uncovered a troubling connection between being a night owl and cognitive decline — with a surprising twist.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-education-factor-changes-everything"&gt;The Education Factor Changes Everything&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the University of Groningen followed participants for 10 years and discovered that &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/night-owls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;night owls&lt;/a&gt; experienced significantly more cognitive decline than early birds. That aforementioned twist? People with less education showed no such pattern, regardless of their sleep preferences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among college-educated participants, each hour shift toward being a night owl was associated with a 0.80-point decline in cognitive test scores over the decade. For someone with the most extreme late sleep schedule compared to an early riser, this translates to measurable differences in &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/exercise-boosts-memory-24-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mental sharpness&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your chronotype is simply your body’s natural preference for when to sleep and wake up. It’s controlled by your &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/circadian-rhythm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;circadian rhythm&lt;/a&gt;, that internal 24-hour clock that regulates everything from body temperature to hormone production. About 20% of adults naturally prefer late bedtimes during midlife, while only 7% are extreme early birds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-smart-night-owls-suffer-more"&gt;Why Smart Night Owls Suffer More&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The education connection appears to be about job flexibility. Highly educated people typically work rigid 9-to-5 office jobs. Executives, managers, teachers, and other professionals with strict morning schedules have little room for natural sleep preferences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, people with less formal education often have more varied work schedules. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/construction-workers-suicide-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Construction workers&lt;/a&gt; might start early, bartenders work nights, and service workers frequently have shifting schedules that could better match their natural sleep timing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When your job forces you to wake up much earlier than your body wants, you experience what researchers call “&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/social-jet-lag-sleep-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;social jet lag&lt;/a&gt;” — essentially chronic biological jet lag. Highly educated night owls may experience this more intensely because they have less control over their work schedules, constantly battling their natural rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Children are morning people. That changes when you reach puberty, when you become an evening person,” says lead author Ana Wenzler in a statement. “Around your 20s, that gradually shifts back towards morning people for most people. By the age of 40, most people are morning people again. But this is certainly not the case for everyone. In this way, evening people deviate from the norm.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sleep-quality-and-smoking-explain-the-damage"&gt;Sleep Quality and Smoking Explain the Damage&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S227458072500113X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;,  identified two key factors behind the cognitive decline: poor sleep quality and smoking habits. Among highly educated participants, these factors accounted for about one-third of the connection between being a night owl and brain fog.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Night owls reported worse &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/lottery-sleep-quality-study/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;, which makes sense. If your body wants to stay up until 2 a.m. but you must wake at 6 a.m. for work, you’re chronically sleep-deprived. Poor sleep hampers the brain’s ability to clear waste products, including proteins associated with &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/alzheimers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Smoking played a surprisingly large role, explaining about 19% of the cognitive decline. Night owls were more likely to smoke, possibly because nicotine provides short-term mental sharpness that helps them cope with the mismatch between their biological clock and work demands.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alcohol consumption and physical activity levels didn’t explain the cognitive decline, even though night owls showed different patterns in these areas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-means-for-millions-of-americans"&gt;What This Means for Millions of Americans&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;About one in five American adults naturally prefer late sleep schedules, meaning millions could be affected, particularly those in professional careers demanding early starts. The study measured &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/cognitive-decline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; using tests of executive function and problem-solving skills that are important for planning and adapting to new situations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While researchers can’t definitively say this decline leads to &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/dementia/"&gt;dementi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/dementia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;, any measurable drop in cognitive function over a decade raises concerns. However, understanding these mechanisms could lead to solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Flexible work schedules might particularly benefit highly educated night owls. Companies allowing later start times for employees whose biology favors evening hours could actually protect their workers’ long-term brain health.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Targeted sleep improvement and smoking cessation programs &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/night-owls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;for night owls&lt;/a&gt; in demanding careers could also help. Since sleep quality and smoking explained 25% of the cognitive decline, addressing these factors could make a real difference.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve published numerous studies on just how important sleep is when it comes to your body’s ability to function optimally. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/sleep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Natural sleep preferences&lt;/a&gt; might have real consequences for brain health, depending on how well your lifestyle fits your biological clock. If you’re a highly educated night owl stuck in an &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/early-birds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;early-bird&lt;/a&gt; work world, you might be paying a cognitive price that builds up over decades. The solution isn’t forcing yourself to become a morning person, but finding ways to work with your natural rhythms or reduce the harm from constantly fighting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed data from 23,798 adults aged 40 and older from the Lifelines cohort study in the Netherlands over approximately 10 years. Participants completed the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire to determine their natural sleep-wake preferences and took the Ruff Figural Fluency Test to measure cognitive function at the beginning and end of the study. The researchers used statistical methods to examine relationships between chronotype and cognitive decline, testing whether factors like education, sleep quality, alcohol intake, physical activity, and smoking explained any connections they found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among highly educated participants, each one-hour shift toward being a night owl was associated with a 0.80-point decline in cognitive test scores over 10 years. No associations were found in low or middle education groups. Poor sleep quality mediated 13.5% of this association, while current smoking explained 18.6%. The combined effect of all measured factors accounted for about 25% of the total relationship between chronotype and cognitive decline in the highly educated group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study only measured cognitive function twice over the decade, and focused specifically on executive function rather than other cognitive domains like memory. Participants who dropped out of the study had lower baseline cognitive scores, potentially affecting results. The cognitive tests were administered at different times of day without recording when, which could affect performance since night owls typically perform worse in morning hours. The study also couldn’t definitively separate the effects of chronotype itself from social jetlag.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-funding-and-disclosures"&gt;Funding and Disclosures&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This research was funded by the Dutch Medical Research Council (ZonMw) as part of the BIRD-NL consortium under the National Dementia Strategy 2021-2030. The authors declared no conflicts of interest. The Lifelines cohort study receives support from multiple Dutch government agencies and institutions.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers followed over two million people and discovered that those with autism were four times more likely to develop the neurodegenerative condition before age 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The connection may stem from shared disruptions in dopamine-related brain systems involved in both movement and social behavior. Even after adjusting for factors like medication use and mental illness, the risk remained notably elevated, suggesting a potential biological overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Autistic individuals are four times more likely to develop early-onset Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Possible Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Dopamine system dysfunction may underlie both conditions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistent Association:&lt;/strong&gt; Risk remains doubled even after accounting for medication and mental health factors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Karolinska Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People with an autism diagnosis are at a higher risk of developing Parkinson’s disease early in life, a large-scale study from Karolinska Institutet published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Neurology &lt;/em&gt;reports. The researchers believe that the two conditions can share underlying biological mechanisms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is based on registry data from over two million people born in Sweden between 1974 and 1999 who were followed from the age of 20 up to the end of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110438"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ASD-Parkinsons-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;“We hope that our results will eventually help to bring greater clarity to the underlying causes of both ASD and Parkinson’s disease,” says Dr Yin. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers interrogated a possible connection between the neuropsychiatric diagnosis Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), which affects an individual’s thought processes, behaviour and interpersonal communication, and early-onset Parkinson’s disease, a condition that affects locomotion and movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopamine can be involved&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results show that people with an autism diagnosis were four times more likely to develop Parkinson’s disease than people without such a diagnosis, a correlation that remained when controlling for socioeconomic status, a genetic predisposition for mental illness or Parkinson’s disease and other such factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This indicates that there can be shared biological drivers behind ASD and Parkinson’s disease,” says the study’s first author Weiyao Yin, researcher at the Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One hypothesis is that the brain’s dopamine system is affected in both cases, since the neurotransmitter dopamine plays an important part in social behaviour and motion control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is well-known that dopamine-producing neurons are degraded in Parkinson’s disease. Previous studies have also shown that dopamine is possibly implicated in autism, but more research needs to be done to confirm this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope that our results will eventually help to bring greater clarity to the underlying causes of both ASD and Parkinson’s disease,” says Dr Yin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical checkups are vital&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression and the use of antidepressants are common in people with autism, as are antipsychotic drugs, which are known for being able to cause Parkinson’s-like symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers adjusted for these factors, the correlation between ASD and the later development of Parkinson’s disease was less salient, but the risk was still double.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers point out that they only analysed early-onset Parkinson’s disease before the age of 50 and that the average age of participants by the end of the study was 34. The incidence of Parkinson’s disease was therefore very low. Future studies will need to examine if the elevated risk persists into older age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The healthcare services need to keep people with ASD – a vulnerable group with high co-morbidity and a high use of psychotropics – under long-term observation,” says the study’s last author Sven Sandin, statistician and epidemiologist at the Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the same time, it’s important to remember that a Parkinson’s diagnosis before the age of 50 is very rare, including for people with autism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was primarily financed by the Simons Foundation and the Swedish Research Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two of the authors have declared funding and fees from pharmaceutical companies unconnected to the study.

Nonetheless, large longitudinal studies examining the risk of PD following ASD are lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine the association between ASD and future PD risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design, Setting, and Participants&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nationwide population-based prospective cohort study was performed using data from Swedish national registers. All individuals born in Sweden from 1974 to 1999 with follow-up from age 20 years until December 31, 2022, and with complete covariate data were included. The analysis was completed in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exposures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnoses of ASD as a time-varying exposure obtained from the National Patient Register.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Outcomes and Measures&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diagnoses of PD were obtained from the National Patient Register through 2022. The relative risk (RR) of PD was quantified using incidence rate ratios with 95% CIs from Poisson regression. Preterm birth, depression, antidepressant use, and antipsychotic exposure over time were potentially modifying life events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 2 278 565 individuals (median [IQR] age at exit, 34 [29-42] years; 1 106 772 female [48.6%]), contributing 33 858 476 person-years. PD occurred in 438 of 2 226 611 individuals without ASD (0.02%; 1.3 cases/100 000 person-years) and 24 of 51 954 individuals with ASD (0.05%; 3.9 cases/100 000 person-years) (RR, 4.43 [95% CI, 2.92-6.72]).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk estimates were similar after adjusting for sex, socioeconomic status, family history of mental illness, family history of PD, and age at ASD diagnosis. Preterm or early-term birth was not associated with and did not modify the PD risk. Depression and antidepressant use (present in 24 257 individuals with ASD [46.7%]) were associated with increased risk of PD (RR, 2.01 [95% CI, 1.40-2.88]), independent of ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antipsychotic exposure (present in 16 387 individuals with ASD [31.5%]) reduced but did not fully attenuate the association (RR, 2.00 [95% CI, 1.27-3.14]) and showed no interaction with ASD on PD risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions and Relevance&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASD was associated with increased risk of PD, even after adjusting for depression or antidepressant use and antipsychotic exposure. These findings suggest a potential shared etiology between neurodevelopmental disorders and PD, and a heightened awareness of long-term neurological conditions in individuals with ASD may be warranted.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 12:42:51 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE1NTnVkaklOaUc0S1djd25tU1BWdFJoYmlDMmpQdTJHM2tYMDdNR1JoZWZDTHJGUVZUUzhaN3BNd2kyVEI4YzFheVBIc3ZuUXF6anpWVlE3bGhiZXV2OGhTNGU3OHAyakdMdWdTMjJxdw</guid></item><item><title>旧金山卫生部门提供的70美元旅行诀窍可以挽救您的生命- SFGATE | $70 travel hack from SF health department could save your life - SFGATE</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxPR1BLRWhPZmlCNklXVHJUNS1xNmk5b0t6ODNFWXZvNFdyM0l1LUxGWVZsV0FGT05jZE5LYWt0NWs3TzREOXB0cHVlNmdVVEgyMVhNWjA0eThaR0haVmtVQ0JuUkdoeUYyTWt3ZzU1d2Q5eFFnWG15bDJnQ1FsVGVadjVHQTdxaThoVkNCOVA5WQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

The system updates hospitalization figures weekly, providing county-by-county breakdowns that help Ohioans understand actual virus circulation in their communities. For the week ending May 22, the dashboard showed 96 COVID-related hospitalizations statewide, down from 130 the previous week, with Cuyahoga County reporting 18 cases compared to 20 the week before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="XMGQSSYCYJAVNENQTQCQ4CI62E"&gt;This emphasis on transparent, accessible data becomes more important as public health guidance grows increasingly fractured along political lines. By creating a single source of reliable information covering multiple respiratory illnesses, Ohio is helping residents make informed health decisions based on current conditions in their specific areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="WSLABLNGRRAERBHAFJQKUDCNEQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/79xE6UlAGErncvGiuEDQZo?si=2f4d22e900ba4073" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://open.spotify.com/episode/79xE6UlAGErncvGiuEDQZo?si=2f4d22e900ba4073"&gt;Listen to the discussion here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="3DABTPTG45DDHP27KDUQ53GF2E"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note: Artificial intelligence was used to help generate this story from Today in Ohio, a news podcast discussion by cleveland.com editors.

But the next morning, 30 million people woke up to a new a diagnosis of hypertension. We had a blood pressure epidemic on our hands. The newspapers were full of front-page stories alerting Americans to this new threat. The most erudite and well-respected physicians implored us all to get checked and treated immediately lest we suffer heart attacks, strokes — even death.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the world of numerical epidemics. Once we base our definition of disease on numerical abnormalities, we can change the numbers in a way that expands those who have the disease. This has been occurring in dramatic fashion the past 20 years, especially since Medicare (by congressional decree) relinquished the task of defining normal numbers to specialty medical societies. Hence the American College of Cardiology can change the definition of an abnormal cholesterol reading or abnormal blood pressure reading such that more people will be labeled with a diagnosed disease related to these numbers. Like­wise, the American Society of Nephrology can broaden the defi­nition of what constitutes abnormal kidney function and expand the scope of those now diagnosed with kidney disease. The list goes on and on, from diabetes to dementia to skin cancer; the criteria for being declared sick is rapidly being broadened, instigating epidemics of diseases across the medical horizon.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These fabricated crises affect well more than half the popu­lation and drive a measure-diagnose-treat crusade to eradicate sickness by prescribing medicines, ordering tests, seeing special­ists, and undergoing procedures, all in an effort to normalize errant numbers. We are squandering trillions of dollars, often to the detriment of our patients, merely to push a number across some arbitrary line of what we call “normal.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Without a doubt, treating high blood pressure and high sugars in a measured and patient-centric way has saved hundreds of thousands of lives. Helping high-risk people with osteoporosis can similarly improve the lives of people we treat intelligently.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But when our zeal to fix all numbers transcends the science, when all patients are viewed similarly regardless of their individual risks, when numbers eclipse the meaningful health of those we are treating, and when what constitutes a “normal” value is con­stantly altered to make more people appear sick, we have all the makings of a Flexnerian epidemic, named for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1863593/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Abraham Flexner&lt;/a&gt;, whose 1911 &lt;a href="http://archive.carnegiefoundation.org/publications/pdfs/elibrary/Carnegie_Flexner_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Flexner Report&lt;/a&gt; set the standard for American medicine. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When Flexner and his colleagues insisted on reconstructing health care upon a bedrock of science, they assumed that if you can test someone and determine what is physiologically aberrant in his or her body, you can address that abnormality and perhaps fix it. Science, to the architects of the Flexner Report, is not fickle or subjective; it is measurable and absolute.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;But they ignored the malleability of scientific “facts.” Studies can be designed to reach foregone conclusions. Cognitive biases can distort our views of what is medically relevant. Benefits of certain interventions to fix abnormalities can be exaggerated and risks minimized. And the very term “abnormal” is hardly objective since it has to be defined by someone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Certain organizations — whether the American College of Cardiol­ogy or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — can influence our definition of normal, espe­cially when assessments are based on medical studies that these groups handpick to use as the barometer of normal. These are only as reliable as those who design them, but their influence carries great weight.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr. S reads the Washington Post regularly, and in 2018 he came to see one of us, Andy, about the front-page headline regarding new blood pressure standards. A systolic reading of 140 used to be a nor­mal pressure, but now it was deemed to be 120. This bold dec­laration, which created 30 million new hypertensives overnight, emanated from the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2017/01/16/blood-pressure-guidelines/"&gt;SPRINT study&lt;/a&gt;, which concluded that aggres­sive treatment of blood pressure in older people results in a 25 percent decrease in stroke and heart attack, and a 40 percent cut in death. When SPRINT defined what a normal blood pressure was, a hypertension crisis gripped the nation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mr. S graphed his and his mom’s blood pressures over time. At ages 68 and 92, both fit in the category of old as defined by SPRINT, but the study did not look at people as old as his mom. He showed Andy the graphs. “Most of the time, we’re way above 120,” he said. “Mom especially. Her blood pressures seem to be all over the map. We need more medicines, doc. I’m going to see my heart doctor in a couple of weeks, but I’m afraid that if we don’t get the numbers down now we could get a stroke any time.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As an engineer, Mr. S placed great value in the significance of numbers. That’s why he created spreadsheets and graphs whereby he could demonstrate the fluctuations and averages of his and his mom’s numbers. It was crucial information, he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The danger of basing a new normal on a single study — and then proclaiming from that study that we have a numerical epidemic that requires aggressive and immediate treatment, as so many doctors and media outlets did — is rife with flaws. The primacy of numerical measurements in diagnosis glosses over salient dif­ferences between people, some of whom might require different normal numerical values than others. It also fails to recognize the harms of treatment and the way that “fixing” one number can affect the body more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SPRINT looked at a few thousand highly screened people, all of whom had severe heart disease, which was not the case with Mr. or Mrs. S. It found that by adding an extra medicine to those with blood pressures over 140 systolic, and getting that pressure below 120, there was substantial improvement in outcome. But what does a 25% &lt;em&gt;relative &lt;/em&gt;reduction in heart attack and a 40% &lt;em&gt;relative &lt;/em&gt;reduction in death actually mean? How many people actually benefited from aggressive blood pressure lower­ing in this very select group?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It turns out, not many: One out of 1,000 people treated aggressively avoided a heart attack or stroke, and two out of 1,000 lived longer by pushing pressures below 120 systolic. But we don’t know how much longer they lived. Not only does the study fail to reveal that fact, it also doesn’t tell us if people live longer because of lower pressure or from some other benefit the add-on medicines might confer in regard to their underlying severe heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Also, though SPRINT claimed to measure adverse outcomes of aggressive treatment, it did not adequately assess the more subjective effects of low blood pressure that we see every day in our offices: dizziness, fatigue, falls, increased confusion, among oth­ers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mrs. S was a perfect example. Her blood pressure fluctuated widely, as is true of many her age, and whenever her heart doctor pushed her pressure too low — usually at the behest of her son — she stayed in bed all day and was very confused. The numbers looked great, but Mrs. S didn’t. Also, lowering the blood pres­sure aggressively triggers other problematic side effects, some of which were seen in SPRINT but largely ignored by those who touted the study’s miraculous findings. There was no mention of the five out of 1,000 people in the treatment group who developed severe kidney disease over the brief trial period, and the 10 out of 1,000 were hospitalized for dangerously low blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mrs. S’s kidney function declined with the addition of her new blood pressure medicine. Already she had been given a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, stage 3, something with which 90% of our elderly patients had been labeled ever since the defi­nition of kidney disease changed. None of these people ever get sick or need dialysis; the diagnosis is merely an inconsequential numerical blip that was now defined as an illness. But now Mrs. S believed that she had a disease. Mr. S brought her to a kidney doctor, who performed pages of labs regularly and an occasional X-ray. Until now, her kidney function had stabilized, but sud­denly with the new pressure medicine it bumped up. “We should stop the medicine,” one of us (Andy) told her son. “Her pressure is too low, and her labs look worse. She feels terrible.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Mom’s kidney doctor begs to differ,” he said. “She wants mom’s pressures as low as possible, and she is closely monitoring many of mom’s kidney tests to be sure we’re on the right track.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Performing tests is one thing. Interpreting the outcome is another. In the late 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries, William Osler, a Canadian physician, emphasized patient care over numerical testing and research. Through an Oslerian lens we simply cannot declare that there is a “normal” blood pressure below which everyone should fall. Everyone is unique, everyone has their own “normal” number, and it is up to a discerning doctor who understands their patient well to interpret the blood pres­sure reading in a way that makes sense for that particular patient. But Mrs. S’s doctor had one goal in mind: &lt;em&gt;normalize the number&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for Mrs. S, soon after her kidney doctor insisted she be put on another pressure pill, she promptly fell down and broke her wrist. “Purely a coincidence,” her son later said. “She tripped.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many studies have demonstrated the danger of aggressively lowering blood pressure, some of which, such as a large &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/0003-4819-159-4-201308200-00004" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Veterans Administration study&lt;/a&gt;, showed worsening renal function and a higher death rate in people aggressively treated who had under­lying kidney disease, a fact that escaped the notice of those who declared the immediacy of our new hypertension epidemic. In fact, a &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa1600177" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published after SPRINT showed an increase of death in people treated aggressively when they did not have severe heart disease, which was the case with Mrs. S and son. This study did not receive much attention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Osler frequently taught that a doctor cannot simply treat a number; he must treat the patient. Mrs. S feels better with higher blood pressure. Maybe her body is pushing her pressure up to get blood through her many narrow arteries, and by lowering the pressure too much she is putting herself and her organs in danger. Also, her blood pressure is not the same from minute to minute, so how can we possibly gauge what her pressure really is and what it should be? Her son, and her specialty doctors, didn’t care about all of that nuance. They read the guidelines, and they vowed to fix her. After all, this was an epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;

Its active compound, curcumin, is often hailed as a natural remedy for various ailments, from joint pain to digestive issues. However, recent reports have raised concerns about the safety of turmeric supplements, particularly when consumed in high doses or combined with certain enhancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been several cases where individuals experienced severe liver damage after taking turmeric supplements. These instances underscore the potential risks associated with overconsumption and the importance of understanding how turmeric interacts with the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, 54 year old Robert Grafton had been taking multiple natural supplements, including turmeric but was then diagnosed with a deadly liver disease. "In early March, the former radiology technologist added something new to his regimen - a turmeric-based liquid supplement. He had seen it advertised for improving liver health on social media. However, a week later, Grafton noticed his urine had turned dark, he felt nauseous, lost his appetite and was constantly itchy," the DailyMail reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tests revealed he has developed drug-induced liver injury. He was taking turmeric pills that contained 2,250 milligrams of curcumin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My liver enzymes were super elevated, my bilirubin (a yellowish pigment produced after red blood cell breakdown) was really high - all the signs of liver failure. I pretty much broke down, my wife as well. I was, at that point, thinking it was liver cancer, pancreatic cancer or something. It turns out I had something called a drug-induced liver injury, which came from my supplements," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) has reported several cases of liver injury linked to turmeric supplements. In a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(22)00740-9/fulltext" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;spanning from 2004 to 2022, ten cases were identified, all occurring after 2011, with a notable increase since 2017. Symptoms reported include fatigue, nausea, dark urine, and jaundice. In severe instances, patients required hospitalization, and one case resulted in acute liver failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to use turmeric supplements safely without affecting the liver? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turmeric is amazing—no doubt about that. It's been used for centuries for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant powers. But when it comes to popping turmeric supplements, especially in high doses, things can get tricky for your liver. So how do you get the benefits without the risks? Easy—go slow and stay smart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, stick to recommended dosages. Just because it’s “natural” doesn’t mean more is better. Most experts say 500–1,000 mg of curcumin per day is enough. Avoid mega doses unless a doctor tells you otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, watch out for black pepper extract (piperine). It boosts absorption big time, but it can also increase the risk of liver issues in some people—especially if you’re taking medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, take breaks. You don’t need to be on turmeric every day forever. Try using it in cycles and give your body a rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And lastly—don’t mix it with alcohol or other supplements that are hard on the liver. If you’ve got any liver problems or take meds, talk to your doctor first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turmeric’s great, but your liver deserves love too. Be smart, go easy, and let turmeric help—not hurt—you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 07:38:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi6wFBVV95cUxOTnhtSUFrbVVwU0h6RXhSUm5aVkxZTk9Rb1VoT2sySFl4bU1BbkxaT2gxaEE1dkgxanA1RWZBdkF1WXB0ZUR3WlQ0cExOc0JrZmVwSGtTVEt6NlVleFpvRjhwY0dWRV9OQThsZER5RXo2aGlMRE1YVnNpQk4xSlhBMU1feGlycHd1dzZERjc3V09hUjJXUHkyWG9jblRNZ2xBQUZQRUxvV1BYbGgtNmlySXhad1VSb0liZVloUXBjY2dOWDQwVWJNdkZGaUxTM19YYWEzckRFaDhJQnFiX1N3ZDVZcDQzckluWUh30gHwAUFVX3lxTFA3TzV3TnQyb1V0WnRPZmFZVE9WUW1vRXZDWjZfRHlRZmxvZmdMTnZFZGZvbVVHZktVNVZsUDlQalYzaEFIcXhuQ3hBVXRib1E3cWl6ZU9HejJFLV9XdEJ3Wm0zNFZ1ZkhIQm10Q293NUZWR0pDQ2lqa0pJcVQ5R01DUEpRRlZrdnkwb3BQT1Y4cTZ0alZiRG5jSExYbzcxQzNHclg0d0dsbnR2ZklhZU9VaWpZbm1DYW9lVU5PSVJhV194Y05mdWZIT2FMbkoxNUFZWjA0WHBZQm51SndZcUNCOV9BMVZSSGZFcERRckdYcw</guid></item><item><title>悲痛欲绝的印第安纳州母亲在8岁的儿子死于致命细菌后警告父母- WTHR | Grieving Indiana mother warns parents after 8-year-old son dies from deadly bacteria - WTHR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi8AFBVV95cUxNYzlES1JqdkJLYTMySzdaM1VDaUxmMnhPVFNib3J0T19LcHFmUzlUM2RpeV9LQ3Q1Yjk3NHpNc2QxajIwUGFQTEdZSEpMaUpBbzNabkI1dk1tVy01R2dlcFJHT3ZURnBFeDJ2X3pHT19SSjZDTzZnTUJaWm4zeU5nZ2o5bWpyYzdjekQzSmxxeGxEak4wd2lZaHZPRXZRRWdHZnA3aFhMa0h3dkNuaHVkOTlvTWphSFhSb3hJUWJxNmhHRHdoMDBlclJZZ1RtV3VhekFCOVJka0FQMGZZai0zaW4tVENmUEIyRDZTSVpUMVY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article__summary"&gt;Ashlee Dahlberg said it all started when her 8-year-old son, Liam, came home from school with a headache in April.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LOWELL, Ind. — An &lt;a href="http://wthr.com/local" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Indiana &lt;/a&gt;mother is using her grief to warn other parents about a bacterial infection that killed her son within hours.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is not your typical everyday flu," said Ashlee Dahlberg of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hi-disease/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Haemophilus influenzae&lt;/a&gt;, also known as "H. flu" or "Hib."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors say it's a bacterium – not a virus – and it's extremely deadly. Most children are vaccinated against it when they're babies.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We later found out that he contracted invasive Hib, which is the more aggressive form of Hib. Anybody that contracts it usually dies within 24 hours," Dahlberg said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dahlberg said it all started when her 8-year-old son, Liam, came home from school with a headache in April. By the next morning, he was being rushed to the hospital. Her normally lively child became delirious at some moments.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"They took him to an MRI. That's when they discovered the amount of bacteria that was covering his brain and spinal cord. Basically at that point in time, there was nothing they could do," Dahlberg said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their lives changed in the blink of an eye.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I would never wish this kind of pain on my worst enemy ever. It's hard. To have sat there and listened to the doctors say, 'You did everything right, there's just nothing we could do,' to lay there with him as they took him off life support, I can feel his little heartbeat fade away — there's no words that can describe that pain."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Eric Yancy is all too familiar with H. flu.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"All the way up to the mid-'70s and early 1980s, it was absolutely devastating. If it didn't kill the children within a very short period of time, it left many of them with significant complications," Yancy said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complications, Yancy said, pretty much ended when the vaccine was created in 1985. Dahlberg said Liam was vaccinated, but Yancy said the boy most likely contracted H. flu from an unvaccinated person, maybe even another child. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We pretty much had it under control, and we pretty much didn't see that many cases of it. Over the last few years, the immunization rates have continued to fall," Yancy said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Dahlberg is urging parents to make sure their children are all properly vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I feel like I have failed my child because I could not protect him from everything that would cause harm," Dahlberg said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
    &lt;/div&gt;

HHS Secretary Robert F.

This weight gain, however, is due to an increase in water weight, not fat. A 2019 study trusted Source found that taking 2 grams (g) of creatine daily and exercising twice weekly for 5 weeks helped participants ages 50 years and older lose slightly more body fat than participants who only exercised. A 2023 review found similar results in people younger than 50 years old. Over the long term, creatine users may continue to increase their body weight more than people who don’t take it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this weight gain is due to increased muscle mass, not body fat. Increased muscle mass may especially benefit older adults, individuals with obesity, and those with certain diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="livtv_and_video_widgt_wrap" data-livetv-switcher-api-url="https://api-mt.firstpost.com/nodeapi/v1/mfp/get-redis?key=FP2.0_fact_live" data-featured-video-api-url="https://api-mt.firstpost.com/nodeapi/v1/mfp/get-videos-list?fields=title,pg_id,id,mongo_id,sources,duration,created_at,shows.slug,shows.title,author_byline.name,images,weburl&amp;amp;sortBy=created_at&amp;amp;offset=0&amp;amp;count=10&amp;amp;filter=%7b%22shows.slug%22:%22vantage%22,%22video_type%22:%22vod%22%7d" data-event-switcher-api-url="https://api-mt.firstpost.com/nodeapi/v1/mfp/get-redis?key=event-switcher" data-category="entertainment" data-env="PROD" data-page-url="www.firstpost.com/entertainment/what-is-creatine-the-supplement-patrick-schwarzeneggers-character-in-the-white-lotus-added-to-his-famous-shake-13892649.html"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Firstpost</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 03:29:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9wFBVV95cUxPWlF0VTNjNDBheU44eGJEZ0lkbWwtbUVMaEMwd20yTFFKZXptNTNiU082R0JpNUJNVWo5elNNQmtLZTM0MDJwclJwZTV1aVRNM2dZdmxZdUVkQ0hUMTVqajc1cmhzM1o2dDJPcmhrYVB1UXRFUm1Gb3NkZHQtbThCak8yT0dtUWwzTnFTTjZUWnhULTlJcTh3SWVBZDBzY0w4dkZfdlFsUHBCTzIxRDV6U2Nsbk5fQkNJM1Q1SmpGTWlDcEJOTjdVbFpVZFFYazgwTGJaLUhqZ1ZCZDV6OWlFY1JSRF9jSk4xdC1Kdm1OaHVwemh0RUQw0gH8AUFVX3lxTE9ZWERPMTRZU2ZVTTgtdFdEVlllREJ2VkZISFlPaUJ2SVBXNXlvQl9NRGxqVE5tWjdkQ2N6ZjVMY1VmZU9ma3NiZFVlUGNYdWRjSUV3NElGSlJHZTFoSUE4aGJRMTZWdmMzNEVkbU1GTVh3NXVvN0IyNExMS2hKTkZndHFXM1FmSnBTQXA3LVktVjZ5am83V0dNeXhOcU0tR3ZDS09CLVMxcDZ4NWFxOEVDalBNR2FpdnJIckJWN3hXelFFcmtiVnl1ZHdQTFhqaVFkblB6U3VWellPVmxvTC1wUnBMSnNNU2Zyb05fU3I5cy1hZERJWUthb3pZSQ</guid></item><item><title>您的压力可能是未来痴呆症的隐性诱因- ScienceAlert | Your Stress Could Be a Hidden Trigger For Future Dementia - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxQVDdiWUFsdnlyT1ZLY1NDbjFjYU83a19CNTBmc1ZTZXU0ODZKQTlwaXVVam81ajVTekNMSl9vOHp0Z3RLejBDOVUxbXVYXzZPZ2J0LWJyYkVyRmdvc0lpcjhhMmNnX3VXZTFJTVB4YWJ5bldTUnBIOFpralN5NGRkemR4SGRmUXBNNTJuM2Vmbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The probability of any American having dementia in their lifetime may be far greater than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, a 2025 study that tracked a large sample of American adults across more than three decades found that their average likelihood of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-024-03340-9"&gt;developing dementia between ages 55 to 95 was 42 percent&lt;/a&gt;, and that figure was even higher among women, Black adults, and those with genetic risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, a great deal of attention is being paid to &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/brain-health/cognitive-health-and-older-adults"&gt;how to stave off cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; in the aging American population. But what is often missing from this conversation is the role that chronic stress can play in how well people age from a cognitive standpoint, as well as everybody's risk for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are professors at Penn State in the &lt;a href="https://healthyaging.psu.edu/"&gt;Center for Healthy Aging&lt;/a&gt;, with expertise in &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;amp;user=wnP42OIAAAAJ&amp;amp;view_op=list_works"&gt;health psychology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;amp;user=00f7MKUAAAAJ&amp;amp;view_op=list_works"&gt;neuropsychology&lt;/a&gt;. We study the pathways by which chronic psychological stress influences the risk of dementia and how it influences the ability to stay healthy as people age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent research shows that Americans who are currently middle-aged or older report experiencing &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/amp0000597"&gt;more frequent stressful events&lt;/a&gt; than previous generations. A key driver behind this increase appears to be rising economic and job insecurity, especially in the wake of the 2007-2009 &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvb.2018.05.001"&gt;Great Recession&lt;/a&gt; and ongoing shifts in the labor market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_117593" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-117593" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/StressBodyFinances-642x260.jpg" alt="Hand of elderly person counting coins" class="size-medium wp-image-117593" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/StressBodyFinances-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/StressBodyFinances-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/StressBodyFinances-600x243.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/01/StressBodyFinances.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-117593" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Financial strain can impact health. (Westend61/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people stay in the workforce longer due to financial necessity, as Americans are living longer and face &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK588545/"&gt;greater challenges covering basic expenses in later life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, it may be more important than ever to understand the pathways by which stress influences cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Social isolation and stress&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although everyone experiences some stress in daily life, some people experience stress that is more intense, persistent or prolonged. It is this &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/spc3.12020"&gt;relatively chronic stress&lt;/a&gt; that is most consistently linked with poorer health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent review paper, our team summarized how chronic stress is a hidden but &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/23727322241303761"&gt;powerful factor underlying cognitive aging&lt;/a&gt;, or the speed at which your cognitive performance slows down with age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to overstate the impact of stress on your cognitive health as you age. This is in part because your psychological, behavioral and biological responses to everyday stressful events &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2018.03.001"&gt;are closely intertwined&lt;/a&gt;, and each can amplify and interact with the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, living alone can be stressful – &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.archger.2019.02.007"&gt;particularly for older adults&lt;/a&gt; – and being isolated makes it &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/adr-230011"&gt;more difficult to live a healthy lifestyle&lt;/a&gt;, as well as to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnac032"&gt;detect and get help for signs of cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, stressful experiences – and your reactions to them – can &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/pag0000704"&gt;make it harder to sleep well&lt;/a&gt; and to engage in other healthy behaviors, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-013-0090-5"&gt;like getting enough exercise&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17437199.2021.1923406"&gt;maintaining a healthy diet&lt;/a&gt;. In turn, insufficient sleep and a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/hea0000532"&gt;lack of physical activity&lt;/a&gt; can make it &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/hea0001033"&gt;harder to cope with stressful experiences&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stress is often missing from dementia prevention efforts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A robust body of research &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/dementia-risk-factors-identified-in-global-report-are-all-preventable-addressing-them-could-reduce-dementia-rates-by-45-236290"&gt;highlights the importance&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(24)01296-0"&gt;at least 14 different factors&lt;/a&gt; that relate to your &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.13809"&gt;risk of Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;, a common and devastating form of dementia and other forms of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although some of these factors may be outside of your control, such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="163002" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt; or  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="163002" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, many of these factors involve things that people do, such as physical activity, healthy eating and social engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145030" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145030" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PeopleHavingConversation642.jpg" alt="People sitting at a table" class="size-full wp-image-145030" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PeopleHavingConversation642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/PeopleHavingConversation642-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145030" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Being isolated makes it more difficult to live a healthy lifestyle. (Peopleimages/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is less well-recognized is that chronic stress is intimately &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/23727322241303761"&gt;interwoven with all of these factors&lt;/a&gt; that relate to dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our work and research by others that we reviewed in our recent paper demonstrate that chronic stress can affect brain function and physiology, influence mood and make it harder to maintain healthy habits. Yet, dementia prevention efforts rarely address stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoiding stressful events and difficult life circumstances is typically not an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where and how you live and work plays a major role in how much stress you experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, people with lower incomes, less education or &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/poor-neighborhoods-health-care-barriers-are-factors-for-heart-disease-risk-in-black-mothers-250591"&gt;those living in disadvantaged neighborhoods&lt;/a&gt; often face more frequent stress and have fewer forms of support – such as nearby clinics, access to healthy food, reliable transportation or safe places to exercise or socialize – to help them manage the challenges of aging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown in recent work on &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s13670-023-00400-9"&gt;brain health in rural and underserved communities&lt;/a&gt;, these conditions can shape whether people have the chance to stay healthy as they age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, the effects of stress tend to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fsci.2024.1389481"&gt;build up&lt;/a&gt;, wearing down the body's systems and shaping long-term emotional and social habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lifestyle changes to manage stress and lessen dementia risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that there are multiple things that can be done to slow or prevent dementia, and our review suggests that these can be enhanced if the role of stress is better understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you are a young, midlife or an older adult, it is not too early or too late to address the implications of stress on brain health and aging. Here are a few ways you can take direct actions to help manage your level of stress:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow lifestyle behaviors that can &lt;a href="https://order.nia.nih.gov/sites/default/files/2025-02/reducing-your-risk-dementia-tip-sheet.pdf"&gt;improve healthy aging&lt;/a&gt;. These include: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metop.2023.100257"&gt;following a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia/what-do-we-know-about-diet-and-prevention-alzheimers-disease"&gt;healthy diet&lt;/a&gt;, engaging in &lt;a href="https://order.nia.nih.gov/sites/default/files/2025-02/reducing-your-risk-dementia-tip-sheet.pdf"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; and getting &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/sleep/sleep-and-older-adults"&gt;enough sleep&lt;/a&gt;. Even small changes in these domains can make a big difference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prioritize your mental health and well-being to the extent you can. Things as simple as talking about your worries, asking for support from friends and family and going outside regularly can be immensely valuable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your doctor says that you or someone you care about should follow a new health care regimen, or suggests there are signs of cognitive impairment, ask them what support or advice they have for managing related stress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you or a loved one feel socially isolated, consider how small shifts could make a difference. For instance, research suggests that adding &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbae134"&gt;just one extra interaction a day&lt;/a&gt; – even if it's &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbac083"&gt;a text message or a brief phone call&lt;/a&gt; – can be helpful, and that even interactions with people you don't know well, such as at a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="163002" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; shop or doctor's office, can have meaningful benefits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uGDypcvptX8?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The same behaviors that keep your heart healthy are also beneficial for your brain.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Walkable neighborhoods, lifelong learning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2025 study identified stress as one of 17 overlapping factors that affect the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2024-334925"&gt;odds of developing any brain disease&lt;/a&gt;, including stroke, late-life depression and dementia. This work suggests that addressing stress and overlapping issues such as loneliness may have additional health benefits as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, not all individuals or families are able to make big changes on their own. Research suggests that community-level and workplace interventions can reduce the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_140463" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140463" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/OlderLadyWalkingExercise642.jpg" alt="A person walking outdoors" class="size-full wp-image-140463" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/OlderLadyWalkingExercise642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/OlderLadyWalkingExercise642-600x386.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-140463" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Physical activity could help prevent dementia. (Alberto Menendez/Canva)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00420-023-01973-w"&gt;safe and walkable neighborhoods&lt;/a&gt; and opportunities for social connection and lifelong learning – such as through community classes and events – have the potential to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pec.2024.108254"&gt;reduce stress and promote brain health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, researchers have estimated that even a modest delay in disease onset of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="163002" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; would save &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1515/fhep-2014-0013"&gt;hundreds of thousands of dollars for every American&lt;/a&gt; affected. Thus, providing incentives to companies who offer stress management resources could ultimately save money as well as help people age more healthfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, stress related to the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-200932"&gt;stigma around mental health and aging&lt;/a&gt; can discourage people from seeking support that would benefit them. Even just thinking about your risk of dementia can be stressful in itself. Things can be done about this, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(23)01406-X"&gt;normalizing the use of hearing aids&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-023-04053-3"&gt;integrating reports of perceived memory and mental health issues&lt;/a&gt; into routine primary care and workplace wellness programs could encourage people to engage with preventive services earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although research on potential biomedical treatments is ongoing and important, there is currently no cure for Alzheimer's disease. However, if interventions aimed at reducing stress were prioritized in &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11121-022-01385-1"&gt;guidelines for dementia prevention&lt;/a&gt;, the benefits could be far-reaching, resulting in both delayed disease onset and improved quality of life for millions of people.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/250583/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

Brigham Young University researchers call sugar in beverages a “major culprit” in the growth of type 2 diabetes cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Not all sugars are equally risky, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831325000493" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2161831325000493"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; they conducted that was just published in the journal Advances in Nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;BYU researchers including a pair of students teamed up with researchers at two Germany-based institutions for what’s being called the “largest and most comprehensive meta-analysis of its kind.” Their key finding is that the kind of sugar one consumes and its source are more important than previously thought and not all sugars carry the same degree of risk for diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Sugar in drinks — think sodas and fruit juice — are “consistently linked” to greater risk of type 2 diabetes, the study found. Other sugar sources showed no such link and, in some cases, might even be associated with reduced risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Sugar itself is not inherently harmful, said lead author and nutritional sciences professor Karen Della Corte. The form and amount consumed make the difference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="The-study-design" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;The study design&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The research included analysis of more than 20 cohort studies from different regions of the world, including Europe, the United States, Asia, Australia and Latin America. They involved a half-million people. The researchers adjusted for body mass index, excess energy intake and several lifestyle factors, according to a BYU news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The new study found:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Each additional 12-ounce serving of sugar-sweetened beverages raised the risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 25%. The risk, per the researchers, began with the first daily serving. They found no minimum threshold below which drinking a sugar-sweetened beverage was safe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With each added 8-ounce serving of fruit juice each day, risk of developing type 2 diabetes was smaller, but still increased by 5%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The risks are relative, according to the BYU research team. In the example of someone with a baseline 10% risk of developing type 2 diabetes, for instance, “four sodas a day could raise that to roughly 20%, not 100%.” And individuals have their own baseline risks, depending on personal factors like genetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The study found the surprising indication that 20g/day of table sugar and total sugar — which is the sum of all naturally occurring and added sugars in the diet — hinted at a protective relationship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;How could that be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The researchers suggest that eating sugar and drinking it have different metabolic effects that may account for the difference in risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Sugar-sweetened drinks provide isolated sugars that kick off greater glycemic impact. That can overwhelm the liver’s metabolic process and cause fatty liver and insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Dietary sugars, though, when consumed in or added to nutrient-dense foods like fruit, dairy products and whole grains, don’t overwhelm the liver. “These embedded sugars elicit slower blood glucose responses due to accompanying fiber, fats, proteins and other beneficial nutrients,” per the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;So sugars eaten with whole foods are much less harmful than those consumed in liquid form, Della Corte said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She noted that the human body is not accustomed to processing and metabolizing the very high amounts of sugars found in sugar-sweetened beverages. “Sugar has always been a part of the human diet. But in the modern age we’re consuming it differently; we’re consuming it in isolated amounts and not in the context of whole foods.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Della Corte said sugar is not a “nutritional villain” on its own. What matters is how much you consume and in what form, as well as whether you’re consuming it alongside macronutrients that can slow down its digestion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“The body can metabolize small amounts of fructose without harm, but when consumed in excess — especially from sugar-sweetened beverages — the liver becomes overwhelmed. Unlike glucose, fructose is primarily metabolized in the liver, where it can be converted into fat through a process called de novo lipogenesis. This buildup of liver fat contributes to the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is associated with insulin resistance. Over time, this can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes,” Della Corte said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;It’s an unhealthy cycle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Della Corte said the study was unique in what it examined. Many other studies have looked at the impact of sugary sodas and other beverages, but not whether different types of sugar have different effects. It also examined the impact of sugar on different populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Fruit-juice-not-ideal-either" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Fruit juice not ideal either&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Fruit juice is not as good for you as whole fruits. Whole fruits provide fiber, which benefits blood glucose regulation. Fruit juices have too much sugar without the nutritional benefits like fiber that can reduce the risk, Della Corte said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She said juices have nearly the same level of sugar as sodas have. It’s somewhat less harmful because of the phytonutrients, but not enough to overcome all the potential harms. “It’s a poor substitute for whole fruits,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She added that high glycemic index foods directly raise the risk of type 2 diabetes, while dietary sugar does not except in liquid form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“This study underscores the need for even more stringent recommendations for liquid sugars such as those in sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice, as they appear to harmfully associate with metabolic health,” said Della Corte. “Rather than condemning all added sugars, future dietary guidelines might consider the differential effects of sugar based on its source and form.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Type 2 diabetes was the sole health indicator used in the study. And the study didn’t look at the impact of artificial sweeteners, such as those found in diet sodas. Della Corte did note that the people who consume artificial sweeteners often do so because they already have a higher risk of health issues like type 2 diabetes, which could further complicate interpreting a study of the impact of artificial sweeteners. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;BYU professors James LeCheminant and Dennis Della Corte, as well as students Tyler Bosler and Cole McClure were also co-authors on the study, along with German researchers Anette E. Buyken of Paderborn University and Lukas Schwingshackl of the University of Freiburg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 02:58:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOejZ1Vi1ZUDFXYTBjLXdRNjNUU3BBcW9sUHpUb1ZHSzF3MnVlcXVzZzdFems4YWQ3UFR2QU9BbkJMQVZRbEF4bXdhdjY3ODg5SC1FcldQRnFQOXVxZm9Jcjk0YXdDYm9ocTFBTS15S3RlS2pNUGtvQlQzNVJDbHU4clVFV0ltU01nbDd2ckVwLW9Ja2RwUjJpZFdaUlRudmZEVE9iNF8ydWZMaXM</guid></item><item><title>2020年和2021年期间，超过200万美国人“失踪” - ScienceAlert | Over 2 Million Americans Went 'Missing' During 2020 And 2021 - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxPNFRXZHpJZnZ1SjVQMWdHU1c3T2dfWnpuOWxXeGRKUlIyTlJtY0tDNVIzOEVCYWI3OXdlaWZ3bnVGUHlhMXJvU0dIR0pRZGo0ZmI1MlVDTFI5TkdKTTlqMUk0M25manNuVlBCWm1SZ1pOSmcyVVMya1BuZ2toZUhSeW8tT0JZd25iVk9hcEdYY1o?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;In the first years of the  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="162652" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="162652" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, Americans &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/02/01/science/covid-deaths-united-states.html"&gt;were dying&lt;/a&gt; at much higher rates than other wealthy nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new analysis now estimates that in 2020 and 2021, more than two million Americans went &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgad173"&gt;'missing'&lt;/a&gt; from the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the people who would still be alive if the US had the same death rate as other high-income nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be clear, not all of these 'excess' deaths are due to COVID-19, but a significant portion are tied to the timing of the global pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Imagine the lives saved, the grief and trauma averted, if the US simply performed at the average of our peers," &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/sph/news/articles/2025/us-excess-deaths-continued-to-rise-even-after-the-covid-19-pandemic/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; lead author and epidemiologist Jacob Bor from Boston University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_162659" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-162659" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/ald250013f1_1747858323.78714-642x866.png" alt="US Excess Deaths" class="wp-image-162659 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/ald250013f1_1747858323.78714-642x866.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/ald250013f1_1747858323.78714-308x415.png 308w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/ald250013f1_1747858323.78714-768x1036.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/ald250013f1_1747858323.78714-1138x1536.png 1138w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/ald250013f1_1747858323.78714-600x810.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/ald250013f1_1747858323.78714.png 1194w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-162659" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;US excess deaths compared to other wealthy nations. (Bor et al., &lt;i&gt;JAMA Health Forum&lt;/i&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis is a broad, sweeping take on a big and complicated issue, but it supports previous &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11113-023-09762-6"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; that have also found Americans suffer poor survival outcomes compared to residents in other wealthy nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study compares more than 107 million deaths of any cause in the US between 1980 and 2023 to death rates in 21 other wealthy nations. The selected countries each had a 2021 GDP exceeding US $24,000 per capita, and had data available in the Human Mortality Database spanning the study period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over those 43 years, the US experienced 14.7 million excess deaths relative to its peers, with a significant uptick starting in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long before the COVID-19 pandemic began, however, data suggest health outcomes in the US were gradually slipping compared to the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spread of a novel  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/coronavirus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73041" data-postid="162652" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coronavirus&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 only widened that gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bor and colleagues calculated that in 2019, there was a total of 631,247 missing Americans. In 2020 and 2021, that number shot up to over a million per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 2022, excess deaths had slipped back to 820,396, before dropping further to 705,331 in 2023. But that is still significantly higher than in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the US experienced the same expected death rates as other nations, the authors of the study think nearly a quarter of all deaths could have been avoided in 2023, many among younger people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One out of every two US deaths under 65 years is likely avoidable," &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/sph/news/articles/2025/us-excess-deaths-continued-to-rise-even-after-the-covid-19-pandemic/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Bor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our failure to address this is a national scandal."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These excess deaths are not simply due to the consequences of the coronavirus, although the pandemic certainly exacerbated the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sociologist Elizabeth Wrigley-Field from the University of Minnesota &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/sph/news/articles/2025/us-excess-deaths-continued-to-rise-even-after-the-covid-19-pandemic/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that the increase in deaths from 2019 to 2023 is also "driven by long-running crises in drug overdose, gun violence, car collisions, and preventable cardiometabolic deaths."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_162663" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-162663" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/ald250013f1_1747858323.78714-1-642x444.png" alt="COVID Mortality Uptick" class="size-medium wp-image-162663" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/ald250013f1_1747858323.78714-1-642x444.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/ald250013f1_1747858323.78714-1-600x415.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/ald250013f1_1747858323.78714-1-768x531.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/ald250013f1_1747858323.78714-1.png 1172w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-162663" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Excess deaths in the US before and after the start of the pandemic. (Bor et al., &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2834281"&gt;&lt;i&gt;JAMA Health Forum&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a previous &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11113-023-09762-6"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; from 2023, researchers used global data to show that the US experiences excess mortality in every single age group compared to its wealthy peers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the US could achieve the lower mortality rates of Japan, for example, the 2023 study suggested more than 880,000 deaths could be prevented. That's comparable to eliminating all deaths from heart disease,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="162652" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; unintentional injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Other countries show that investing in universal healthcare, strong safety nets, and evidence-based public health policies leads to longer, healthier lives," &lt;a href="https://www.bu.edu/sph/news/articles/2025/us-excess-deaths-continued-to-rise-even-after-the-covid-19-pandemic/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; senior author Andrew Stokes, demographer and sociologist at Boston University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These deaths reflect not individual choices, but policy neglect and deep-rooted social and health system failures. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed structural weaknesses – including gaps in healthcare access and social supports – that have continued to fuel premature deaths even after the acute phase of the pandemic ended."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research letter was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamahealthforum.2025.1118"&gt;&lt;i&gt;JAMA Health Forum&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

He had seen it advertised for improving liver health on social media. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a week later, Grafton noticed &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14571833/toxic-liver-disease-face-skin-rosacea-signs.html"&gt;his urine had turned dark&lt;/a&gt;, he felt nauseous, lost his appetite and was constantly itchy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Believing his deteriorating health was tied to the supplements, he stopped consuming them and went to the hospital out of fear that he was suffering from liver failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Testing revealed he had a drug-induced liver injury, or DILI, which caused damage to his liver due because of his excessive turmeric consumption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A DILI is often caused by any kind of medication or supplement that claims to promote muscle growth or reduce stress. These types of supplements often contain similar ingredients that can harm the liver when consumed in excess. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Robert Grafton, 54, a New Jersey father-of-five is warning people of taking 'herbal' supplements after he was left fighting for his life due to a rare liver injury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Grafton told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/supplements-drug-induced-liver-damage-toxic-hepatitis-what-know-rcna208390"&gt;NBC&lt;/a&gt;: 'My liver enzymes were super elevated, my bilirubin (a yellowish pigment produced after red blood cell breakdown) was really high - all the signs of liver failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I pretty much broke down, my wife as well. I was, at that point, thinking it was liver cancer, pancreatic cancer or something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It turns out I had something called a drug-induced liver injury, which came from my supplements.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The liver is responsible for numerous bodily functions, including filtering blood, processing nutrients and detoxifying the body of harmful substances, such as alcohol and drugs.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is also responsible for providing support to the immune system, clotting blood and producing bile, a fluid that helps digest fats and absorb nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, sometimes an excessive consumption of ultra-concentrated supplements, whether they are of natural ingredients or those chemically made, can cause an injury if the liver isn't able to effectively filter them out of the body, causing them to build up in toxic amounts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Dina Halegoua-De Marzio, a hepatologist who treated Grafton told NBC: 'I think people assume these things are safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The Number one reason we see people taking these are for good health or to supplement their health and so I don't think that they realize that there is a real risk here.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She noted that even though Grafton had stopped taking supplements after noticing he was sick, a turmeric overload had already occurred in his body and caused an injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Grafton was taking turmeric pills that contained 2,250 milligrams of curcumin, a substance that comes from the root of the turmeric plant and black pepper extract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it remains unclear which turmeric-filled supplement Grafton took, an average turmeric and curcumin supplement tablet brought at common convenience stores contains 500mgs of the spice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts claim a daily consumption of less than 2,000mgs of turmeric through supplements is considered safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Dr Dina Halegoua-De Marzio, a Jefferson Health hepatologist who treated Grafton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While it remains unclear which turmeric-filled supplement Grafton took, an average turmeric and curcumin supplement tablet contains 500 milligrams of the spice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Halegoua-De Marzio said: 'When you cook with turmeric, that could be really safe. But some of the supplements now are 2,000mgs plus, which is a very high dose of turmeric.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Coupled with black pepper, the liver now has to break down that supplement and it can't. It could make it really sick.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Numerous studies have shown turmeric can improve liver health by decreasing inflammation, reducing the accumulation of fat and detoxifying the organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, other studies suggest natural supplements made with turmeric can also cause serious liver injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2010 peer-reviewed study showed over 40,000 Americans report liver damage due to medications and supplements annually - out of which over 2,000 end up dying because of the severity of their condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But despite scientific evidence, herbal supplements continue to become more popular. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2024 JAMA Network study found that turmeric is the most commonly consumed supplement in the US, followed by green tea extract, ashwagandha, Garcinia cambogia, red yeast rice and black cohosh. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found 15.6million Americans take supplements containing at least one of these six botanicals - mostly without a doctor's advice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration considers herbal supplements as dietary supplements and does not regulate, oversee or approve them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Therefore, it is impossible for consumers to know whether they re actually consuming what is advertised or if it is safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In April 2025, Jenny Ramirez, experienced liver failure that she linked to methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), an ingredient in a common over-the-counter vitamin that claims to improve hair, skin and nail health &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Grafton is not the only person to suffer from DILI or serious liver damage due to a supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In April 2025, Jenny Ramirez, experienced liver failure due to a typically innocuous ingredient called methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), which is in common over-the-counter vitamins that claim to improve hair, skin and nail health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has found MSM to be generally benign and even protective against liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some scientists have said, however, that MSM could exacerbate liver damage in people with pre-existing liver disease, though research and data are limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Still, Ramirez became jaundiced, with yellowing skin and eyes. She also had to undergo surgery to remove her gallbladder because of hard deposits that had built up there, blocking the flow of bile through the liver and gallbladder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in 2023, a 45-year-old woman was found to be suffering from herbal supplement-induced liver injury after she complained of gastric pain and nausea from consuming an herbal tea for three days to improve immunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Over 40,000 Americans report liver damage due to medications and supplements annually&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Responding doctors noted she showed no signs of jaundice, had a non-tender abdomen and showed signs of liver infection such as Hepatitis A. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after a series of tests and exams, they found that the presence of reishi mushroom, aloe vera and Siberian ginseng - all natural herbs - had caused her pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for Grafton, after finding out he had a liver injury, Grafton said his blood work had returned to normal within weeks of ceasing the supplements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additional testing revealed no permanent damage to his liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'The whole push with that is that you're getting a super-high, concentrated dose of turmeric and dandelion root and milk thistle, which I have always known from my medical past is good for liver health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It all sounded good, I thought I did enough digging.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because on his experience, he added: 'I don’t take any supplements whatsoever.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 May 2025 01:58:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>血脑屏障“守护者”显示出对抗阿尔茨海默氏症的承诺- ScienceAlert | Blood-Brain Barrier 'Guardian' Shows Promise Against Alzheimer's - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxNNFM0MnoyMDBoWnZMMGZ2V0hBX1JIMk1IM0N0THRrazlHd3FmNlVhZVcxMDVaelJ4dXZnRDRkSUZybUdfaFVpRXFaRXhYaEdHN3V2djl2ZGNZMXJuX1pYYktYMU13X0xLUVNLZDFzUE0zUFBBNnV5RXM5d29lT0FDcDJrNkxNZExPN2x0R25pOWphdlEz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A new drug targeting inflammation in the brain has been shown to bolster the blood-brain barrier in mice, pioneering a potential shift in the fight against neurodegenerative diseases like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="162692" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Finding [the drug] blocks brain inflammation and protects the blood-brain barrier was an exciting new discovery," &lt;a href="https://thedaily.case.edu/potential-new-treatment-for-alzheimers-disease-other-neurodegenerative-conditions/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; pathologist Sanford Markowitz from Case Western Reserve University (CWRU).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's more, the researchers note that amyloid levels – the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newly-identified-proteins-may-explain-devastating-effects-of-alzheimers"&gt;abnormally clumping proteins&lt;/a&gt; traditionally thought to play a role in the progress of Alzheimer's – remained the same. This suggests the new treatment, focusing on an immune protein called 15-PGDH, targets a completely different physiological pathway than many existing medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_162699" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-162699" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons.jpg" alt="3D illustration of yellow clumps amongst blue and purple cells and molecules" class="wp-image-162699 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons-642x500.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-162699" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Illustration of the amyloid plaques (yellow) amongst neurons. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADq3tpYQR4/"&gt;Science Photo Library/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is important because the most recently approved Alzheimer's drugs focus only on removing amyloid and, unfortunately, don't work very well and have risky side effects," &lt;a href="https://thedaily.case.edu/potential-new-treatment-for-alzheimers-disease-other-neurodegenerative-conditions/"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Markowitz. "Inhibiting 15-PGDH thus offers a completely new approach for Alzheimer's disease treatment."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood%E2%80%93brain_barrier"&gt;blood-brain barrier&lt;/a&gt; is a layer of tissue that any substance entering the brain via the blood must pass through. When intact, the barrier filters out potential dangers such as toxins, bacteria, and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/virus" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73053" data-postid="162692" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;viruses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK326726/"&gt;can damage&lt;/a&gt; this barrier, increasing risks to brain cells. Such blood-brain barrier deterioration has &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-alzheimers-link-points-to-immune-attack-and-blood-brain-barrier"&gt;also been identified&lt;/a&gt; as a possible early indicator of dementias like Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By investigating the molecules active within the blood-brain barrier cells, CWRU physiologist Yeojung Koh and colleagues were able to identify that the immune enzyme 15-PGDH was elevated in both mice and humans with neurodegeneration arising from age, injury, or disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, the researchers developed SW033291; a compound that can block the enzyme's activity. The medication was found to successfully protect the blood-brain barrier in mice and prevent cognitive impairment even after traumatic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In these mouse models treated with the drug, the blood-brain barrier remained completely undamaged," &lt;a href="https://thedaily.case.edu/potential-new-treatment-for-alzheimers-disease-other-neurodegenerative-conditions/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neuroscientist Andrew Pieper, also from CWRU. "The brains didn't undergo neurodegeneration and, most importantly, cognition and memory capacity were completely preserved."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_162697" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-162697" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/BloodBrainBarrierAnatomyDiagramWithLabels.jpg" alt="Diagram of the blood brain barrier anatomy" class="wp-image-162697 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/BloodBrainBarrierAnatomyDiagramWithLabels.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/BloodBrainBarrierAnatomyDiagramWithLabels-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/BloodBrainBarrierAnatomyDiagramWithLabels-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-162697" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Anatomy of blood vessels within the brain with the extra layers of protection formed in part by astrocytes known as the blood-brain barrier.

And despite decades of research, treatment outcomes &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-discovery-could-explain-why-weve-been-misled-over-the-cause-of-alzheimers"&gt;remain unclear&lt;/a&gt;. Exploring new tactics like this is essential to improving lives, but there's still a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings establish 15-PGDH as a guardian of blood-brain barrier integrity… and a compelling target for protection from neurodegenerative disease," Koh and team &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2417224122"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2417224122"&gt;PNAS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

This fresh take comes from a team at the &lt;a href="https://english.cas.cn/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS);elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)&lt;/a&gt;, offering new insight into how aging might not be as fixed as once thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their work centers on metformin, a widely used drug for type 2 diabetes. Though common, this medication may hold uncommon promise: the ability to slow the aging process itself. Researchers believe this could eventually lead to treatments that help people live healthier, longer lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study brought together leading experts in the field. Liu Guanghui and Qu Jing, both from the Institute of Zoology, teamed up with Zhang Weiqi from the &lt;a href="http://english.big.cas.cn/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Beijing Institute of Genomics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Beijing Institute of Genomics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings appeared in &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(24" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Cell;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt;00914-0), a top-tier scientific journal. The work reflects a growing wave of curiosity about extending not just lifespan, but also healthspan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Metformin treatment changed microglia from a proinflammatory phenotype (left) into a noninflammatory phenotype (right) in the aged hippocampus. (CREDIT: Aging Cell)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/fda-approved-ed-drug-can-significantly-reduce-blood-sugar-levels-in-type-2-diabetics/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:metformin;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;metformin&lt;/a&gt;’s effect on aging, the team studied Cynomolgus monkeys—animals with biology much like ours. Their close genetic and physiological ties to humans make them ideal for exploring how anti-aging treatments might work. This choice gave the study real weight in the context of human health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over a 40-month period, the scientists tracked the monkeys’ health using a battery of advanced tools. These included medical imaging, blood tests, physiological checks, and deep tissue analysis across multiple organs. Male monkeys received metformin regularly, allowing researchers to observe any long-term changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. Metformin provided clear protective effects across several vital organs. The liver, heart, lungs, and muscles all showed &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/omega-3-vitamin-d-and-exercise-proven-to-slow-down-aging/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:slower signs of aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;slower signs of aging&lt;/a&gt;. These findings suggest that this familiar diabetes drug may do far more than control blood sugar—it might help protect the body from age itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related Stories:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, it mitigated the atrophy of the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-discover-how-your-brain-converts-sounds-into-actions/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cerebral cortex;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cerebral cortex&lt;/a&gt;, enhanced cognitive function, and slowed periodontal bone loss. This suggests that metformin may be acting directly on neurons and other cells, independent of its usual function in blood sugar regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study identified that metformin activates the Nrf2-mediated antioxidant gene expression network in the brain, delaying the effects of cellular aging. This mechanism provides a strong scientific basis for metformin’s geroprotective properties and could pave the way for future therapeutic advancements aimed at slowing down aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to its direct impact on neurons, the researchers employed machine learning models to evaluate the overall systemic effects of metformin on aging. These models helped them build a comprehensive assessment of tissue and &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/scientists-discover-enzyme-that-reverses-muscle-loss-due-to-aging/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:organ aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;organ aging&lt;/a&gt;, allowing for precise evaluations of the drug’s benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;High-precision aging clocks at the single-cell level demonstrated that the biological age of neural cells in the brain and hepatocytes in the liver was reduced by approximately five to six years. (CREDIT: Cell)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results indicated a significant reduction in biological age markers in primates treated with metformin. DNA methylation age, transcriptome age, and plasma protein and metabolite age were all reduced. The most substantial reduction observed was equivalent to 18 human years, a striking finding that highlights metformin’s potential in delaying biological aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effects of metformin were most pronounced in the frontal lobe of the brain and the liver, two areas particularly vulnerable to aging. High-precision aging clocks at the single-cell level demonstrated that the biological age of neural &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/researchers-unlock-the-secret-to-a-longer-life-through-brain-cells/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cells in the brain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cells in the brain&lt;/a&gt; and hepatocytes in the liver was reduced by approximately five to six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When translated to humans, this is equivalent to about 15 to 18 years. The study’s thorough and methodical approach offers new paradigms and standards for evaluating human aging interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Metformin slows brain aging in primates. (CREDIT: LIU Guanghui's lab)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the researchers emphasized, the study’s implications are far-reaching. "This is a significant step forward in understanding the biology of aging," said one of the lead scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also highlights the shift in geriatric medicine from treating individual &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-find-surprising-link-between-dishwashers-and-chronic-illnesses/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:chronic conditions;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;chronic conditions&lt;/a&gt; to addressing the aging process as a whole. This transition represents a new frontier in healthcare, one that targets the root causes of aging to improve overall health and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As human life expectancy continues to rise, the focus on aging-related diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and cardiovascular conditions, has grown. However, this study demonstrates the possibility of targeting the aging process itself, rather than merely treating its consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With metformin showing such potential, future research could lead to broader applications for humans, possibly helping to reduce age-related decline and enhance the quality of life in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Metformin slows brain aging in primates. (CREDIT: LIU Guanghui's lab)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research opens new doors to understanding and potentially reversing aspects of aging. By using metformin, scientists have not only expanded knowledge about cellular aging but also laid the groundwork for future therapies aimed at delaying the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/harvard-researchers-create-new-pill-that-can-reverse-the-aging-process/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:aging process;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;aging process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This represents a major leap forward in the field of geriatric medicine, signaling a future where aging may not be an inevitable decline, but a process that can be managed and perhaps even reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: Materials provided above by &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Brighter Side of News;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Brighter Side of News&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The federal government announced Wednesday that it is cancelling a contract to develop a vaccine to protect people against flu viruses that could cause pandemics, including the bird flu virus that's been &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/13/nx-s1-5296672/cdc-bird-flu-study-mmwr-veterinarians" target="_blank"&gt;spreading among dairy cows &lt;/a&gt;in the U.S., citing concerns about the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/12/nx-s1-5325863/nih-trump-vaccine-hesitancy-mrna-research" target="_blank"&gt;safety of the mRNA technology&lt;/a&gt; being used.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Department of Health and Human Services said it is terminating a $766 million contract with the vaccine company Moderna to develop an mRNA vaccine to protect people against flu strains with pandemic potential, including the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/27/1263339284/bird-flu-update-influenza" target="_blank"&gt;H5N1 bird flu virus that's been raising fears&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"After a rigorous review, we concluded that continued investment in Moderna's H5N1 mRNA vaccine was not scientifically or ethically justifiable," HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This is not simply about efficacy — it's about safety, integrity, and trust. The reality is that mRNA technology remains under-tested, and we are not going to spend taxpayer dollars repeating the mistakes of the last administration, which concealed legitimate safety concerns from the public," Nixon said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He added that "the move signals a shift in federal vaccine funding priorities toward platforms with better-established safety profiles and transparent data practices. HHS remains committed to advancing pandemic preparedness through technologies that are evidence-based, ethically grounded, and publicly accountable." The official did not provide any additional details.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/jnuzzo" target="_blank"&gt;Jennifer Nuzzo&lt;/a&gt;, the director of Brown University's Pandemic Center, said the decision was "disappointing, but unsurprising given the politically-motivated, evidence-free rhetoric that tries to paint mRNA vaccines as being dangerous."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"While there are other means of making flu vaccines in a pandemic, they are slower and some rely on eggs, which may be in short supply," Nuzzo added in an email. "What we learned clearly during the last influenza pandemic is there are only a few companies in the world that make flu vaccines, which means in a pandemic there won't be enough to go around. If the U.S. wants to make sure it can get enough vaccines for every American who wants them during a pandemic, it should invest in multiple types of vaccines instead of putting all of our eggs in one basket."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The cancellation comes even though Moderna says a study involving 300 healthy adults had produced "positive interim" results and the company "had previously expected to advance the program to late-stage development."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis of the Phase 1/2 study of our H5 avian flu vaccine and we will explore alternative paths forward for the program," Stéphane Bancel, Moderna's chief executive officer, said &lt;a href="https://www.accessnewswire.com/newsroom/en/healthcare-and-pharmaceutical/moderna-announces-update-on-investigational-pandemic-influenza-progra-1033069" target="_blank"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. "These clinical data in pandemic influenza underscore the critical role mRNA technology has played as a countermeasure to emerging health threats."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The administration's move drew sharp criticism from outside experts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This decision puts the lives and health of the American people at risk," said Dr. &lt;a href="https://dean.sph.brown.edu/dean" target="_blank"&gt;Ashish Jha&lt;/a&gt;, the dean of the Brown School of Public Health, who served as President Biden's COVID-19 response coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Bird Flu is a well known threat and the virus has continued to evolve. If the virus develops the ability to spread from person to person, we could see a large number of people get sick and die from this infection," Jha said. "The program to develop the next generation of vaccines was essential to protecting Americans. The attack by the Administration on the mRNA vaccine platform is absurd."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/michael-t-osterholm-phd-mph" target="_blank"&gt;Michael Osterholm&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota agreed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"This decision will make our country far less prepared to respond to the next influenza pandemic," he said in an email. "This is a dangerous course to follow."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, the H5N1 flu virus has spread to 41 dairy herds, and 24 poultry farms and culling operations, and caused 70 human cases. While the virus has had a high mortality rate in other countries, so far H5N1 has only caused one death in the U.S. and has not shown any signs of spreading easily from one person to another. But infectious disease experts are concerned that the more the virus spreads, the greater the chance it could mutate into a form that would spread from person to person, which would increase the risk of a pandemic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the possibility of the cancellation had been anticipated — the new leadership at HHS told the company in February that &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/03/hhs-moderna-vaccine-contract-bird-flu-pandemic-preparedness-worries/"&gt;it was reviewing the contract&lt;/a&gt;, signed with the Biden administration — the move is being seen as a significant blow to the country’s capacity to respond to pandemic influenza.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;No other flu vaccine production approach can produce doses with the speed of the messenger RNA platform used by Moderna and other companies that work with mRNA. But the vaccine platform is viewed with deep suspicion by health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his political base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a diagnostic challenge, and doctors began reviewing the list of possibilities that could match his condition. The first guess of pneumonia could explain some of his respiratory findings, but he didn't have a cough, had tested negative for common respiratory pathogens, and the lung imaging didn't quite fit, making it seem unlikely. Blood cancers, such as polycythemia vera, might be able to explain the high concentrations of blood cells. And it might also make him more vulnerable to opportunistic lung infections, like a fungal infection that could explain the halo sign. But blood cancers were also deemed unlikely given that he didn't have enlarged organs, which is often seen with such conditions. Another possibility of pulmonary–renal syndrome, but that also didn't line up with the man's case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one other possibility that seemed to tick all the boxes: fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, low oxygen saturation, pulmonary edema, and shock—a hantavirus infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hantaviruses are RNA viruses that infect rodents worldwide. They typically cause asymptomatic, chronic infections in the animals, which spread the virus widely into their environments through their urine, feces, and saliva. Humans get infected when virus particles from rodent-contaminated areas are stirred up into the air and inhaled, or through direct contact with the virus via the eyes, nose, mouth, or cuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In humans, the viral infection is anything but asymptomatic. While &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1286457906001882?via%3Dihub"&gt;the disease mechanism&lt;/a&gt; isn't entirely understood, the virus appears to be able to modulate immune responses in humans, causing blood vessels and capillaries in various places in the body to start leaking plasma. This leads to fluid building up in the lungs (the pulmonary edema) and systemic circulatory collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cardiopulmonary hantavirus infection typically has four stages: the incubation period, which can last up to 45 days after virus exposure; a prodromal phase up to 12 days that are marked by fever, fatigue, and pains; the cardiopulmonary phase, where breathing trouble, low oxygen saturation, and shock can develop; then, if you make it, the fourth stage, in which respiratory symptoms improve, but there's lingering fatigue and the kidneys make abnormally large amounts of urine.&lt;/p&gt;

Scientists studying mice found that individual neurons in the Substantia Nigra pars reticulata (SNr) switch dynamically between activation and inhibition based on the phase of a movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These SNr signals work like traffic lights, allowing complex behaviors to emerge from precisely timed combinations of “go” and “stop” instructions. The findings could reshape treatments for disorders like Parkinson’s, where this balance of movement control breaks down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Signaling:&lt;/strong&gt; SNr neurons dynamically increase or decrease activity depending on specific movement phases like reach, grasp, or retract.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traffic Light Model:&lt;/strong&gt; The basal ganglia output works like a fine-tuned traffic control system, licensing or blocking individual movements in real time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings may lead to better treatments for movement disorders like Parkinson’s by targeting precise timing mechanisms in motor control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Basel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurons deep in the brain not only help to initiate movement—they also actively suppress it, and with astonishing precision. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the conclusion of a new study by researchers at the University of Basel and the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research (FMI), published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings are especially relevant for better understanding neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110420"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-movement-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This study focuses on the so-called Substantia Nigra pars reticulata (SNr), the main output station of the basal ganglia, which sends signals to motor centers in the brainstem. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reaching for an apple or bringing a spoon to the mouth—these seemingly simple actions rely on highly complex processes in the brain. A key player in this orchestration is a deep-seated brain region known as the basal ganglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a long time, the output signal of the basal ganglia was thought to function mainly as a brake, suppressing unwanted behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers led by Professor Silvia Arber have now shown in mice that specific neurons in the basal ganglia make highly precise decisions about when to allow and when to actively stop a specific movement. Together, these dynamic signals license the timing of movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basal ganglia: A central switchboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These insights challenge the long-standing model of how the basal ganglia work. According to the traditional view, the basal ganglia control movement by continuously inhibiting motor centers in the brain, only briefly “releasing the brake” when a movement is allowed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But this model falls far short in terms of complex movements, such as those involved in coordinated actions of the arms and hands,” explains Arber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study focuses on the so-called Substantia Nigra pars reticulata (SNr), the main output station of the basal ganglia, which sends signals to motor centers in the brainstem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers made a surprising discovery: the neurons in this region don’t merely fire to inhibit movement. Instead, they display highly dynamic activity patterns —precisely timed to the movements being executed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During complex behaviors, SNr neurons switch multiple times between increased and decreased activity, each neuron with its specific dynamic pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, the output of the basal ganglia functions like a finely tuned system of traffic lights at a busy intersection: each light turns green or red for specific movements, depending on the action that is planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this way, complex behaviors can be built from individual movements, governed by the timing of these “go” and “stop” signals provided by SNr neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fine-grained movement control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate these processes, two of Arber’s doctoral students recorded brain activity in mice as these used their hands to reach for food pellets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that individual SNr neurons responded very differently depending on the movement phase: when the arm reached, the hand grasped, or was retracted, specific neurons increased their activity while others paused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s amazing how finely tuned these signals are,” Antonio Falasconi and Harsh Kanodia, the study’s lead authors, agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“SNr neurons only pause their activity during very specific movements and increase it during select others.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using optogenetic techniques, the researchers then manipulated SNr neurons. They were able to show that activating these neurons blocked the behavior—a clear demonstration of their controlling role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most strikingly, even the slightest changes in movement were accompanied by precise adjustments in SNr signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downstream motor centers in the brainstem responded by sending signals back to the SNr. So when the SNr “traffic light” turned green, the downstream neuron essentially presses the gas pedal, allowing the execution of a movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This points to a highly specific, movement-based coding system—far more granular than just a general “go” or “stop” mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New avenues for treating movement disorders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study offers a vivid picture of how the brain controls even the subtlest movements through a fine-tuned interplay of activation and inhibition—reshaping our understanding of motor control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has important medical implications: in disorders like Parkinson’s or chorea, this delicate balance is disrupted, leading to hallmark symptoms such as difficulty initiating movement in Parkinson’s patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we understand how the basal ganglia coordinate normal movement, we can develop more targeted treatments when this system goes out of balance,” explains lead researcher Arber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d1b0bfb6b4bdb8bab0ffbbb0b2beb3a291a4bfb8b3b0a2ffb2b9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Angelika Jacobs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://unibas.ch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Basel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Angelika Jacobs – University of Basel&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09066-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dynamic basal ganglia output signals license and suppress forelimb movements&lt;/a&gt;” by Silvia Arber et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic basal ganglia output signals license and suppress forelimb movements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The basal ganglia are fundamental to motor control and their dysfunction is linked to motor deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Influential investigations on the primate oculomotor system posited that movement generally depends on transient pauses of tonically firing inhibitory basal ganglia output neurons releasing brainstem motor centres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, prominent increases in basal ganglia output neuron firing observed during other motor tasks cast doubts on the proposed mechanisms of movement regulation through basal ganglia circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we show that basal ganglia output neurons in the mouse substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) represent complex forelimb movements with highly granular and dynamic changes in spiking activity, tiling task execution at the population level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single SNr neurons exhibit movement-specific firing pauses as well as increases, each occurring in concert with precise and different forelimb movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining optogenetics and simultaneous recordings from basal ganglia output and postsynaptic brainstem neurons, we reveal the functional role of these dynamic firing-rate changes in releasing and suppressing movement through downstream targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, our results demonstrate the existence and function of highly specific and temporally precise movement representations in basal ganglia output circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We propose a model in which basal ganglia output neurons fire dynamically to provide granular and bidirectional movement-specific signals for release and suppression of motor programs to downstream circuits.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 20:50:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE5VQlRwV1VIVkwtc3U0bTNGQ05RZ0pJbkdhVHBUWU5JX3NrQlZjQlYza1ZYT2NraFJPc2p2MklneVBfdWRjcDllYmw1QWVtb2dqMWtrNmxtbWlpNWFaX0hIM0FpY0xEOFdhbF9PT0N3WENHeHM</guid></item><item><title>咖啡如何影响睡眠大脑- Medical Xpress | How coffee affects a sleeping brain - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE9RZjdaelJLQ1ZPTExrbWd5RVR4bHhnTktkaGtzeVN5aXdWak1ZU0I4dXlBTGphb1hEcUdxNDRuMkQ3a3NlRUd5bXIzQmpmeWV5SHFSM2w2Rm5kWm10QlEwcldGb05yYldTLWFmQWZzRWc3UQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is not only found in coffee, but also in tea, chocolate, energy drinks and many soft drinks, making it one of the most widely consumed psychoactive substances in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In a study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-025-08090-z" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Communications Biology&lt;/i&gt;, a team of researchers from Université de Montréal shed new light on how caffeine can modify sleep and influence the brain's recovery—both physical and cognitive—overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was led by Philipp Thölke, a research trainee at UdeM's Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience Laboratory (CoCo Lab), and co-led by the lab's director, Karim Jerbi, a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/psychology+professor/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;psychology professor&lt;/a&gt; and researcher at Mila–Quebec AI Institute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with sleep-and-aging psychology professor Julie Carrier and her team at UdeM's Centre for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine, the scientists used AI and electroencephalography (EEG) to study caffeine's effect on sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They showed for the first time that caffeine increases the complexity of brain signals and enhances brain "criticality" during sleep. Interestingly, this was more pronounced in younger adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Criticality describes a state of the brain that is balanced between order and chaos," said Jerbi. "It's like an orchestra: too quiet and nothing happens, too chaotic and there's cacophony. Criticality is the happy medium where brain activity is both organized and flexible. In this state, the brain functions optimally: It can process information efficiently, adapt quickly, learn and make decisions with agility."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carrier added, "Caffeine stimulates the brain and pushes it into a state of criticality, where it is more awake, alert and reactive. While this is useful during the day for concentration, this state could interfere with rest at night; the brain would neither relax nor recover properly."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;40 adults studied&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To study how caffeine affects the sleeping brain, Carrier's team recorded the nocturnal brain activity of 40 healthy adults using an electroencephalogram. They compared each participant's brain activity on two separate nights—one when they consumed caffeine capsules three hours and then one hour before bedtime, and another when they took a placebo at the same times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We used advanced statistical analysis and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/artificial+intelligence/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; to identify subtle changes in neuronal activity," said Thölke, the study's first author. "The results showed that caffeine increased the complexity of brain signals, reflecting more dynamic and less predictable neuronal activity, especially during the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) phase of sleep that's crucial for memory consolidation and cognitive recovery."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also discovered striking changes in the brain's electrical rhythms during sleep: Caffeine attenuated slower oscillations such as theta and alpha waves—generally associated with deep, restorative sleep—and stimulated beta wave activity, which is more common during wakefulness and mental engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These changes suggest that even during sleep, the brain remains in a more activated, less restorative state under the influence of caffeine," says Jerbi, who also holds the Canada Research Chair in Computational Neuroscience and Cognitive Neuroimaging. "This change in the brain's rhythmic activity may help explain why caffeine affects the efficiency with which the brain recovers during the night, with potential consequences for memory processing."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;People in their 20s more affected&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that the effects of caffeine on brain dynamics were significantly more pronounced in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/young+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;young adults&lt;/a&gt; between ages 20 and 27 compared to middle-aged participants aged 41 to 58, especially during REM sleep, the phase associated with dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young adults showed a greater response to caffeine, likely due to a higher density of adenosine receptors in their brains. Adenosine is a molecule that gradually accumulates in the brain throughout the day, causing a feeling of fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Adenosine receptors naturally decrease with age, reducing caffeine's ability to block them and improve brain complexity, which may partly explain the reduced effect of caffeine observed in middle-aged participants," Carrier said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These age-related differences suggest that younger brains may be more susceptible to the stimulant effects of caffeine. Given caffeine's widespread use around the world, especially as a daily remedy for fatigue, the researchers stress the importance of understanding its complex effects on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain activity&lt;/a&gt; across different age groups and health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They add that further research is needed to clarify how these neural changes affect cognitive health and daily functioning, and to potentially guide personalized recommendations for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/caffeine/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;caffeine&lt;/a&gt; intake.&lt;/p&gt;

The rush of heat, the pounding heart, and the urges to shout or slam a door feel almost automatic. Most of us just want lash out and vent, hoping the anger will be gone as fast as it came.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, people have sworn by “getting it out,” whether by screaming into a pillow or pummeling a punching bag. Others swear by the opposite approach: pause, breathe, let it pass. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new scientific sweep of the evidence puts these rival tactics head-to-head – and crowns a clear winner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-venting-anger-myth-loses-steam"&gt;The ‘venting anger’ myth loses steam&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the second paragraph, it’s time to meet the researchers. Communication scholar &lt;a href="https://comm.osu.edu/people/bushman.20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Brad Bushman&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://osu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ohio State University&lt;/a&gt; has spent years testing the notion of catharsis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Venting anger might sound like a good idea, but it’s actually counterproductive,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His team, working with postdoctoral fellow &lt;a href="https://sophiekja.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sophie Kjærvik&lt;/a&gt;, combed through 154 different studies with more than 10,000 people to sort myth from reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their review shows that activities lowering bodily arousal – deep breathing, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mindfulness-protects-against-work-stress-burnout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;mindfulness&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/meditation-slows-biological-aging-at-the-molecular-level/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;meditation&lt;/a&gt;, even slow, controlled yoga – consistently push anger levels down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The setting hardly matters; results hold for solo exercises at home, therapist-guided sessions, and app-based programs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Reducing arousal – and actually the physiological aspect of it – is really important,” Kjærvik explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-numbers-say"&gt;What the numbers say&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kjærvik’s meta-analysis, published in &lt;em&gt;Clinical Psychology Review&lt;/em&gt;, found that every group studied – college students, retirees, people with intellectual disabilities, and individuals with criminal records – benefited from arousal-decreasing strategies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In stark contrast, jogging, hitting a bag, or smashing plates in a rage room showed little effect or even nudged anger upward. “To reduce anger, it is better to engage in activities that decrease arousal levels,” Bushman notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta-analyses of this size are rare in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/ai-shows-better-emotional-intelligence-than-humans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;emotion research&lt;/a&gt;. By pooling so many participants, the team could spot small but steady patterns that single experiments miss. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consistency across gender, age, and cultural background signals that calming the body is a universal recipe, not a fad tied to one social-media trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-calm-beats-cardio"&gt;Calm beats cardio&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why would a brisk run fail where a quiet breath succeeds? Anger already revs the sympathetic nervous system – the body’s gas pedal. Adding more acceleration simply keeps the engine roaring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Certain physical activities that increase arousal may be good for your heart, but they’re definitely not the best way to reduce anger,” Bushman adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/yoga-can-reduce-stress-and-improve-brain-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Yoga&lt;/a&gt; offers an intriguing twist. Though poses raise heart rate, the practice embeds steady breathing and focused attention, turning movement into meditation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was really interesting to see that progressive muscle relaxation and relaxation in general might be as effective as approaches such as mindfulness and meditation,” Kjærvik noted. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“And yoga, which can be more arousing than meditation and mindfulness, is still a way of calming and focusing on your breath that has a similar effect in reducing anger.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-inside-the-body-s-alarm-system"&gt;Inside the body’s alarm system&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anger sparks a full-body alert: faster heartbeat, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/drinking-from-plastic-bottles-linked-to-high-blood-pressure-and-heart-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;higher blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, surging adrenaline. The sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system primes muscles for fight or flight, while its calmer twin – the parasympathetic branch – waits to dial everything back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Techniques that lengthen exhales or tense and release muscles flip that switch sooner, cooling the system before words or fists fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists think this quick reset evolved because it lets social groups resolve conflicts without lasting harm. Lowering arousal gives the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-brain-pathways-identified-as-being-unique-to-humans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;prefrontal cortex&lt;/a&gt; – our planning center – time to weigh consequences, recall past regrets, and choose words more carefully. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The payoff is fewer broken dishes, lower stress hormones, and relationships that bounce back instead of break.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-reducing-anger-without-venting"&gt;Reducing anger without venting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apps offering guided breathing now sit within arm’s reach, many of them free of charge. A simple routine – inhale for four counts, exhale for six – can drop heart rate within a minute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two cycles of progressive muscle relaxation ease shoulder knots that broadcast irritability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A five-minute mindfulness session on YouTube can do the same job as a longer appointment when time is tight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s really a battle because angry people want to vent, but our research shows that any good feeling we get from venting actually reinforces aggression,” Bushman says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For situations demanding movement, try a slow walk around the block. Keep the pace easy enough to hold a steady conversation. Pair it with attention to your surroundings – the hum of cicadas, the scent of fresh-cut grass. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gentle motion helps metabolize &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/stress-hormones-rise-during-sleep-to-prepare-your-body-for-the-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;stress hormones&lt;/a&gt; without driving arousal higher, and nature’s small details pull focus away from rumination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-does-any-of-this-matter"&gt;Why does any of this matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unchecked anger strains marriages, work teams, and the cardiovascular system. Over months, it can hardwire aggressive habits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new review shows there’s nothing inevitable about that spiral; swapping venting for calming returns control to the driver’s seat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because most interventions cost little or nothing, workplaces, prisons, and schools can roll them out without red tape. Even a coach’s whistle can cue athletes to pause for three slow breaths before play resumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents can apply the same thinking at home. Instead of sending a child to “go punch a pillow,” suggest three balloon-slow breaths, a sip of water, and a quiet corner until color fades from their cheeks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modeling the strategy yourself teaches by example and keeps the living room peaceful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooling down trumps blowing up. Evidence from more than 10,000 volunteers says so, and the message holds whether you are nine or ninety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So next time fury rises, skip the punching bag and breathe. Your heart – and everyone within earshot – will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full study was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735824000357?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Clinical Psychology Review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 20:03:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxOTERJMGpmZE9UNi1ZeVJRcDFic0xZMVlkenJKVnBJWVpQMVlfMU11cXV4bzQ5V0paemprSUU4N3NBWXlUYTNKb2hva294MEpIMlBiVkcxZ0M5dEFfVTRIZ3M1QjJPcGxHOGo4bldKamJqSDgtdS1mVktPMnNsZzlNVmdjUkJTaFgxVXNqaGNRSW1KZ3Z4MTBRNVQzVzN1Zw</guid></item><item><title>Lilly Jay博士从未要求成为焦点，但她已经准备好发声了- glamour.com | Dr. Lilly Jay Never Asked for the Spotlight—But She’s Ready to Speak Up - glamour.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOOTdINXg5S3Q4alhPQVJ6eWRrQmhLd3RjcTBMenhRR01FZmtwR2kyYVhGY0JrZGNDZ0xIYzZRU2Y4bjYwLVhGSlYtVHpkc3RsNnRBa1R5ZEs2NmotR2QwejJDMS1vV21kdkVqREE3elFtcXU3U2dKcXRUTnNabjUwSlpKTG1aTXptZG9od2NZa1JxY1JkRzBVWGRRSjY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s the moment, she thinks, to use her public voice for good. So Dr. Jay has decided to join the medical board of a science-backed parenting platform, Riley, in order to help bring its suite of mental-health support resources to more parents nationwide. The app, which was previously only available in beta mode via a waitlist, is open to the public as of Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amanda DeLuca founded &lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.rileyapp.com/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22532269371&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAA90kCE5lfe1wk648TtLkSXQx0v7hw&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw6NrBBhB6EiwAvnT_rtmYi_J37NjbkVg75D_sB3oMxg15nol3QMpqVvL8ngHkA5c8w8uu4RoCoLEQAvD_BwE" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.rileyapp.com/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22532269371&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAA90kCE5lfe1wk648TtLkSXQx0v7hw&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw6NrBBhB6EiwAvnT_rtmYi_J37NjbkVg75D_sB3oMxg15nol3QMpqVvL8ngHkA5c8w8uu4RoCoLEQAvD_BwE"}' href="https://www.rileyapp.com/?gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22532269371&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAA90kCE5lfe1wk648TtLkSXQx0v7hw&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw6NrBBhB6EiwAvnT_rtmYi_J37NjbkVg75D_sB3oMxg15nol3QMpqVvL8ngHkA5c8w8uu4RoCoLEQAvD_BwE" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Riley&lt;/a&gt; in November 2023 after her own experience with postpartum depression. When DeLuca, a former Etsy and NerdWallet product lead, was in the throes of her mental-health struggle following the 2022 birth of her daughter, she recalls spending hours doomscrolling the internet, simmering in her myriad anxieties of what could happen to her baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not an uncommon experience—many moms admit spending way too much time googling their fears plus using Reddit, then spiraling down a rabbit hole of toxicity that makes their condition worse, not better. What Riley aims to do, DeLuca tells me, is provide a science-based, all-in-one parental advisory platform to provide support that reduces the mental load of constant optimization and worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What you should be getting out of using the app is just more joyful time with your children and feeling more confident, making good decisions, and spending quality time with them,” DeLuca tells me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, more plainly, helping parents to put down their phones. It’s one of the things that Dr. Jay sees in her practice that she wants to help alleviate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a clinician, I hear so many patients contend with the constant work of trying to sort through the entire internet’s worth of knowledge about parenting,” she says. “Then they get to a point where they’re too exhausted to do anything with the information, and they’ve also lost a lot of time and either maintained or amplified their own anxieties in the constant searching. Getting a good clear answer that you can do something with, and is in conversation with whatever you are still tracking about your baby, frees you up to get back to the important work that will never be replaced by an app, which is parenting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking publicly about these issues, Dr. Jay thinks, is a first step to determining what this next phase of her life will look like. She grows most passionate when speaking about the myriad of crises facing her patients and American mothers at large, noting that our country currently has “maternal mortality and morbidity rates, especially for women of color, that are unconscionable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with all of her resources and privilege, Jay says, when she gave birth to her son she was not always believed when she talked about what she was experiencing in her own body. In the hospital, she repeatedly told her medical team that she felt something was wrong, only to be told she simply had a headache from the dry hospital air. She actually had preeclampsia, a dangerous and serious pregnancy complication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Dr. Jay, something needs to change, starting with making our health care system “more responsive to the full complexity of pregnancy.” It will not only make women safer; it will also make them better mothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>glamour.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 19:07:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOOTdINXg5S3Q4alhPQVJ6eWRrQmhLd3RjcTBMenhRR01FZmtwR2kyYVhGY0JrZGNDZ0xIYzZRU2Y4bjYwLVhGSlYtVHpkc3RsNnRBa1R5ZEs2NmotR2QwejJDMS1vV21kdkVqREE3elFtcXU3U2dKcXRUTnNabjUwSlpKTG1aTXptZG9od2NZa1JxY1JkRzBVWGRRSjY</guid></item><item><title>健康回报： RFK Jr.的新冠疫苗建议变更可能威胁健康，获取- CNBC | Healthy Returns: RFK Jr.’s Covid vaccine recommendation change could threaten health, access - CNBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxOQmZoLXFzZHpzZXprSlMtNHg4cllhbmFpMFZjZmdYdTc0Rml5dTZhWWFlT1BxWU5kMjhEd1A3T0dnTTdxSnlseDg5OFpZMEVjUHB3TVF3bDk4SHBVSHJxckpEZXJKVTRhcnlndHJOM0NnUUdwbXY2Mm1WeTVmTHZ3NE9aeFBuLV9Pa2RxTWY2dWFfVVZ3SHg2U0dTalHSAaIBQVVfeXFMUG1iZWNyRnFxVUFBRllJUjB5dnphbVdZMFkzREc0TWc3Z3FieXBoRkUwX0pIMDkyX0lvd2ViWUMtNWMzX1dVNWd2cmVSaG1wamVIRC13am5vdVNacGZfSG9vUEx4VnJ1WEszVDJWMmtrZUxXVklMejFlNlhrRWExVHc4cEx2YTJXaTc1SHhUY1JLSE9PbmQ3cjg1bGtnWnhBUEJR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleBody-articleBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-ArticleBody-6" data-module="ArticleBody" data-test="articleBody-2" data-analytics="SpecialReportArticle-articleBody-6-2"&gt;&lt;span class="HighlightShare-hidden"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A version of this article first appeared in CNBC's Healthy Returns newsletter, which brings the latest health-care news straight to your inbox. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/healthy-returns-newsletter/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Subscribe here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to receive future editions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wave of outrage is sweeping the scientific and medical world after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s decision to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/27/cdc-ends-covid-vaccine-recommendation-for-healthy-kids-and-pregnant-women.html"&gt;stop recommending routine Covid-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for healthy children and healthy pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy, a prominent vaccine skeptic, on Tuesday said the Covid shot has been removed from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommended immunization schedule for those groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Last year, the Biden administration urged healthy children to get yet another Covid shot, despite the lack of any clinical data to support the repeat booster strategy in children," Kennedy said in a &lt;a href="https://x.com/seckennedy/status/1927368440811008138?s=46" target="_blank"&gt;video &lt;/a&gt;on X. He offered no scientific evidence to justify the change to the recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's Kennedy's latest move to change and potentially undermine vaccinations in the U.S. since he took the helm at the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the federal agencies that regulate and recommend shots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes a week after Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/20/fda-stricter-covid-vaccine-approval.html"&gt;set stricter standards&lt;/a&gt; for approving shots for healthy Americans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some health experts say the dropped recommendation could have devastating consequences, particularly for pregnant women and their babies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both are considered to be at &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/risk-factors/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;higher risk of severe &lt;/a&gt;complications from Covid-19 infections, according to the CDC's website. That can include&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/pregnancy-and-covid-19/art-20482639#:~:text=Pregnant%20people%20with%20severe%20COVID,high%20blood%20pressure%20or%20preeclampsia." target="_blank"&gt; preterm labor and birth&lt;/a&gt;, heart injury, blood clots and kidney damage among pregnant women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As ob-gyns who treat patients every day, we have seen firsthand how dangerous COVID-19 infection can be during pregnancy and for newborns who depend on maternal antibodies from the vaccine for protection," Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He emphasized that "the science has not changed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Following this announcement, we are worried about our patients in the future, who may be less likely to choose vaccination during pregnancy despite the clear and definitive evidence demonstrating its benefit," Fleischman said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7338a1.htm#:~:text=Maternal%20vaccination%20during%20pregnancy%20has%20been%20shown,months%2C%20including%20those%20who%20are%20pregnant%20(8%2C9)" target="_blank"&gt;Studies have found&lt;/a&gt; that Covid-19 vaccination reduces the risk of hospitalization from the virus for pregnant women and infants younger than 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fleischman and other experts also raised concerns about whether patients will have access to vaccines following Kennedy's decision. The CDC's recommendation is crucial because it guides insurance plans on which shots to cover at no cost to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medicare and Medicaid require that the recommended vaccines are free for patients. The Affordable Care Act requires private insurers to cover all vaccines recommended by the CDC's outside committee of vaccine advisors and director.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Children without insurance can get free recommended vaccines through the government-run Vaccines for Children Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-8"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/PFE/"&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-9"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/MRNA/"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are charging up to $150 per dose for their respective Covid shots before insurance, according to the CDC's &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/php/awardees/current-cdc-vaccine-price-list.html" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This decision could make it significantly harder for millions of Americans to access vaccines they want for themselves and their families," Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.idsociety.org/news--publications-new/articles/2025/new-covid-vaccine-recommendations-threaten-access-undermine-choice-and-will-negatively-impact-health/" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tan added that process for Kennedy's decision breaks with the precedent of letting federal panels of experts publicly debate scientific evidence and vote on immunization practices. A group of external advisors to the CDC typically gives vaccine advice to the agency's director. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump's nominee to lead the CDC, acting director Susan Monarez, still needs Senate confirmation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This decision bypasses a long-established, evidence-based process used to ensure vaccine safety and ignores the expertise of independent medical experts, including members of CDC committees who are examining the evidence regarding the vaccine to make recommendations for the fall," Sean O'Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/05/acog-statement-on-hhs-recommendations-regarding-the-covid-vaccine-during-pregnancy" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that the decision could "strip families of choice," preventing those who want to vaccinate from getting shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feel free to send any tips, suggestions, story ideas and data to Annika at &lt;a href="http://nbcuni.com/?__source=newsletter%7Chealthyreturns" target="_blank"&gt;annikakim.constantino@nbcuni.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="ArticleBody-subtitle"&gt;&lt;a id="headline0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Latest in health-care tech: Hinge Health makes its debut on the New York Stock Exchange &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-imageEmbed" id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-108149556" data-test="InlineImage"&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCaption"&gt;Hinge Health Inc. signage on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) during the company's initial public offering (IPO) in New York, US, on Thursday, May 22, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="InlineImage-imageEmbedCredit"&gt;Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="group"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you hear that? That was the sound of the digital health sector breathing a collective sigh of relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digital physical therapy company &lt;span class="QuoteInBody-quoteNameContainer" data-test="QuoteInBody" id="SpecialReportArticle-QuoteInBody-14"&gt;&lt;a href="/quotes/HNGE/"&gt;Hinge Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="QuoteInBody-inlineButton"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistContainer" id="-WatchlistDropdown" data-analytics-id="-WatchlistDropdown"&gt;&lt;button class="AddToWatchlistButton-watchlistButton" aria-label="Add To Watchlist" data-testid="dropdown-btn"&gt;&lt;span class="AddToWatchlistButton-addWatchListFromTag"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; debuted on the New York Stock Exchange last week &lt;strong&gt;in &lt;/strong&gt;the sector's first major public exit in several years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broader tech IPO market has been in a drought since late 2021, when soaring inflation and rising interest rates pushed investors out of risky assets. And within digital health, there's been practically no IPO activity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hinge, founded in 2014, uses software to help patients treat acute musculoskeletal injuries and chronic pain, as well as carry out post-surgery rehabilitation remotely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock opened at $39.25 on Thursday, rising 23% from its $32 IPO price. It closed up 17% at $37.56 a share, bringing its market capitalization to more than $3 billion. As of Wednesday afternoon, shares are trading at more than $41. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to its IPO, Hinge had raised more than $1 billion from investors including Insight Partners, Atomico, Tiger Global Management and Coatue Management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most analysts will officially kick off coverage of the stock around 30 days after its debut. But analysts at Roth shared some initial thoughts about Hinge earlier this month, before it went public. Importantly, they did not participate in the offering, make a recommendation or initiate coverage in their report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We watched HNGE's IPO roadshow presentation and were impressed by the AI products underpinning the platform and rate of care expansion," including beyond musculoskeletal conditions, the analysts said in a note on May 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hinge said that revenue in its first quarter climbed 50% to $123.8 million, up from $82.7 million during the same period last year. The company reported $117.3 million in revenue during its fourth quarter, up 44% from the same period in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Roth analysts said the company's recent fundamentals are encouraging, including its accelerating revenues and billings as well as its improved operating margins. Some of the risks facing the company include the competitive digital therapy landscape, its reliance on peer-reviewed data and regulatory overhang, they said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Hinge's debut, another digital health company is preparing to join the fray.

In Connecticut, rabies is usually carried by skunks, raccoons, and bats but any mammal could carry the disease. The Department wants to remind residents to protect themselves and their pets from contact with these wild animals.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more from the Meriden Department of Health and Human Services below:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are simple precautions that you can take:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vaccinate your pets. Be sure your pet dogs, cats, ferrets and other animals are up-to-date on their rabies vaccinations. Pets too young to be vaccinated should be kept indoors and allowed outside only under direct observation. Your veterinarian can let you know if your pet is too young to be vaccinated.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep family pets indoors at night. Don’t leave them outside unattended or let them roam free.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t attract wild animals into your home or yard. Keep your property free of stored bird seed or other foods that may attract wild animals. Feed pets indoors. Tightly cap or put away garbage cans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t feed, touch or adopt wild animals, stray dogs or cats. Enjoy wildlife from a distance. If you see that an animal is sick, injured or orphaned, call Animal Control (203-235-4179). Do not handle the animal yourself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get wild animals removed from your home. If nuisance wild animals are living in parts of your home, consult with a nuisance wildlife control expert about having them removed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teach children not to touch any animal they do not know and to tell an adult immediately if they are bitten by any animal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Let wild animals wander away if they are on your property. Bring children and pets indoors and alert neighbors who are outside.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Report all animal bites or contact with wild animals to your local health department. If possible, do not let any animal escape that has possibly exposed someone to rabies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more information about rabies in both humans and animals, visit the Center for Disease Control and Prevention at &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/rabies" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;www.cdc.gov/rabies&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sardines also offer &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/selenium-8689983" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;selenium&lt;/a&gt;, a trace mineral that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/antioxidants-7969374" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;functions as a powerful antioxidant&lt;/a&gt;, said Routhenstein.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You don’t need to eat sardines every day to benefit your heart. Eating one can is more than the 1.1 g daily minimum recommended for general health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

"Sardines also contain purines, which should be considered by those prone to &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/fish-and-gout-5093098" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;gout&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If the idea of popping open a can of sardines makes you squeamish, don’t worry—Routhenstein says they’re surprisingly easy to work into meals, such as:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Serve on toast or crackers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snacks with a punch&lt;/strong&gt;: Pair sardines with avocado and seaweed for a nutrient-packed snack.&lt;/li&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;COVID-19 cases are rising again as a new variant begins to circulate in some parts of the world. The World Health Organization said Wednesday the rise in cases is primarily in the eastern Mediterranean, Southeast Asia and western Pacific regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airport screening in the United States has detected the new variant in travelers arriving from those regions to destinations in California, Washington state, Virginia and New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new variant is called NB.1.8.1. It arrives as the United States’ official stance on COVID-19 vaccination is changing. On Tuesday, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that COVID-19 shots are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women — a move immediately questioned by several public health experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/kennedy-says-government-no-longer-recommends-covid-vaccines-for-healthy-children-and-pregnant-women"&gt;Kennedy says government no longer recommends COVID vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new variant, increasing globally, had by mid-May reached nearly 11% of sequenced samples reported. The WHO has designated it a “variant under monitoring” and considers the public health risk low at the global level with current vaccines expected to remain effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WHO said some western Pacific countries have reported increases in COVID cases and hospitalizations, but there’s nothing so far to suggest that the disease associated with the new variant is more severe compared to other variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The variant called LP.8.1 is currently the dominant version in the U.S. and globally.&lt;/p&gt;

"What we know is that when a virus is more transmissible, it will ultimately infect more people and when you infect more people ... you'll have more cases of severe illness, hospitalization, and unfortunately death. "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Data from China and elsewhere doesn't seem to show anything unique about the variant other than increased transmissibility, Brownstein added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Some of the variant's mutations found on the surface proteins of the virus could increase its transmissibility and potentially make it somewhat harder to treat compared to current variants in wide circulation, according to the WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Approved COVID-19 vaccines are expected to remain effective against this variant, according to the WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"This is the natural path we've seen with every variant, and so the guidance doesn't really change at the end of the day," Brownstein said. "It's making sure people are up to date with their vaccines and boosters ... and then of course, those that are immunocompromised or in high-risk groups may want to layer in other types of interventions like masking or being careful about large group settings where there could be increased risk of transmission."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Niki Iranpour, MD, is an internal medicine resident at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center and a member of the ABC News Medical Unit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 17:32:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxOOXBJWGFZSGk0OGRSYWVWMUdNWjFQejUxenFJaE9YZjJJd1ZCVTM0XzhfN21vUFZVY3EwX2hsN01mc2NjQzlLZmx3NzBUQ2hNSEMwcFF3M1ViV29kdmFYY2gyWVZRcnEwaTJTZlZURlZiS0N2bzI2WFpFb1FqaU9HTXBjMUo5Q1V2QUVSaW9lNE90UGF1ZzZUbNIBngFBVV95cUxQalFZLV91OEdHSGZRUDF3QUZsMGhTbHBfV3lianRxLTFlMlROVjcwVnRzemN4MTY2bFdIRWljN3NlY3FKVEZuaUozaDVzaUQ1Nk12U2Fqd1M1ZndRRVctVWZaQ0dRcmkzekptVGdQektQdUluNHN0Nk5HSkZHaVJ0cjdreEt1Rm16d0pJcUNRQkNCTnZ2bm1pX0NiTWZfZw</guid></item><item><title>疾病预防控制中心削减后，医生担心女性将无法获得避孕研究- NPR | After CDC cuts, doctors fear women will lose access to contraception research - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi4gFBVV95cUxOSzFhNFQxSkUtc0FYanpRQWJOR2FHcnJmMU82bUdNWEV6dTRlVkJhQ3ZReGhRZG1YR044WXE3bk80VWdoSkF2Rk9mbVRTaVF0azdxWk5fZGstN25aYlFvS2xhbDFzUmhUVWtKSHp1b01Ub3k3QW8zV3hlSlc0YlRkaVNNOU4xbUdNNU9nU08xWkRTeHZZZVUwUTZDaUZGTVg1MHQyZnRYVWlDTE1yNHZUYWwxZVM2X1hvMnJrc1ZTem91Yk1HSFg1bVRIU1ZPWHBiUFhTS2YyVjBVUlNlX1UxZWN3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;To most people, the eight-person team was indistinguishable from the hundreds of other scientists and researchers cut in April during the mass firings at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But for many clinicians who specialize in women's health, losing the team responsible for the CDC's contraception guidelines was a devastating&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/24/nx-s1-5376473/hhs-restores-funding-for-womens-health-initiative" target="_blank"&gt; blow to women's health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;" I just remember feeling like — of all the things — I think contraception shouldn't be controversial," says Dr. Angeline Ti, a family physician in the Atlanta, Georgia area who specializes in reproductive healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team was responsible for aggregating and disseminating best practices around contraception in a set of guidelines called &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/contraception/hcp/usmec/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"I knew that things were gonna happen at CDC, but I thought that these guidelines were so important," says Ti. She says she uses the guidelines "pretty much every time" she sees a patient for contraceptive care. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Other doctors describe feeling equally shocked. "I mean, there is no other resource that is doing this," says Dr. Andrea Braden, an obstetrician in Atlanta, Georgia. "All the OB-GYN's use it."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Representatives from the Department of Health and Human Services and the Trump administration did not explain why the CDC team was cut. It was eliminated in April as part of the reduction of the Women's Health and Fertility Branch of the Division of Reproductive Health.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;NPR reached out to HHS for comment on this story, but did not receive a response.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; An indispensable app&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Busy doctors who are seeing many patients, says Braden, simply do not have time to comb through all the latest medical research. So, the CDC team made recommendations available &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/contraception/hcp/contraceptive-guidance/app.html" target="_blank"&gt;in an app &lt;/a&gt;that doctors could download and easily reference with questions about contraception, including how to navigate the topic for patients with specific conditions and diseases. It was downloaded &lt;a href="https://www.nationalfamilyplanning.org/file/2024-national-conference/DRH_Nguyen_SL_NFPRHA-2024---clean.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;440,000 times&lt;/a&gt;, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The app was just a game changer for us," says Braden. "That was very clearly organized, really easy to digest, and it was such a nice quick reference for us. It was a resource that we all trusted intuitively."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The current guidelines are still accessible, while the team charged with updating them no longer exists.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Doctors caution that even though the recommendations were issued relatively recently, without careful monitoring they will soon be out of date. " Medicine is not static," says Dr. Deva Sharma, a hematologist who said the guidelines are a critical part of her medical practice. "It's constantly evolving and improving."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The team issued guidelines most recently in 2024. One example of a change that Braden says had a significant impact on her conversations with her patients is around recommendations for breastfeeding mothers using birth control. The new guidelines for the first time acknowledged that some contraception can jeopardize milk supply in nursing mothers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This update, she says, represented a sea change in a way of thinking about the importance of empowering patients to make their own decisions about breastfeeding. " That was such an important aspect of the update," says Braden. "It helped us guide our practice, rather than tell people what they need after they have a baby. It really put the patient at the center of the conversation."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For some patients and doctors dealing with specific conditions, conversations about contraception can be matters of life or death. Sharma specializes in treating women with Sickle Cell disease — an inherited red blood cell disorder — which puts patients at a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2800895#:~:text=The%20maternal%20mortality%20rate%20in,%3B%2095%25%20CI%2C%200.5%2D" target="_blank"&gt;much greater risk &lt;/a&gt;of life threatening complications in pregnancy than people without the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sharma calls the termination of the CDC team "detrimental to women's health," and also recalls vividly the moment she found out when a colleague sent her a message. "I remember just feeling overwhelmed and devastated," says Sharma.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the recent guidelines, the CDC team changed recommendations for women with Sickle Cell Disease, which already puts patients at increased risk for blood clots. Doctors who treat this disease say they now rarely prescribe certain forms of contraception to their patients due to new evidence suggesting these kinds of treatments can create an even greater risk.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Braden says she is still feeling confused as to why such a valuable resource was eliminated. " I don't understand," she says "Why them? Why this sector of medicine? This is a waste."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She warns that doctors will not be able to compensate for the medical updates that this guide provides. " Medicine changes so quickly and it is very difficult to keep up with all of it," she warns. "New data comes out — new research comes out — and we find out that there's a better way to do things. Contraceptive medicine is no different from that."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missing treatment options are hard to measure &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many patients will not necessarily know about medical updates they do not benefit from, but Teonna Woolford is one patient who does understand the utility of the CDC's guidelines around contraception.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Born with&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/12/05/1129125408/for-patients-with-sickle-cell-disease-fertility-care-is-about-reproductive-justi" target="_blank"&gt; Sickle Cell Disease,&lt;/a&gt; Woolford started a non-profit, &lt;a href="https://sicklecellred.org/meet-our-team/" target="_blank"&gt;Sickle Cell Reproductive Education Directive&lt;/a&gt;, that advocates for patients like herself. Woolford says the disease is often characterized by uncertainty and difficulty in making hard decisions around treatment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Having the guidelines was really like a proactive approach to addressing contraception," says Woolford. "There are a lot of knowledge and research gaps on this subject."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sickle Cell Disease disproportionately affects people of color, a group that Woolford notes has not historically enjoyed parity in reproductive justice. "The removal of the CDC team to me just &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/05/1186019422/the-black-maternal-mortality-crisis-and-why-it-remains-an-issue" target="_blank"&gt;reminds me of darker times&lt;/a&gt; in our history when people of color were oppressed," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Black women in the United States have disproportionately &lt;a href="https://policycentermmh.org/maternal-mortality-in-the-u-s-a-declining-trend-with-persistent-racial-disparities-in-the-black-population/#:~:text=Disparities%20widen%20for%20Black%20Women:%20Black%20women,than%20Hispanic%20(12.4)%20and%20Asian%20(10.7)%20women.&amp;amp;text=Black%20women%20had%2050%20deaths%20for%20every,2023%2C%20up%20slightly%20from%2049.5%20in%202022." target="_blank"&gt;high rates of maternal mortality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Braden sees the team's elimination as a setback to women everywhere. "It really hurts those of us in women's health — to target something like contraceptives." says Braden. "This is basic healthcare for OBGYNs and it was really defeating. I would say I felt angry and sad and confused."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;She and other doctors point out that many women in the U.S. can no longer legally terminate pregnancy. They say that makes it especially important for them to be able to make an informed choice about the best ways to prevent becoming pregnant in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;" Bodily autonomy has been taken away from women in various states," says Dr. Sharma, who practices in Tennessee — a state &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/04/04/1242721479/how-narrow-can-a-medical-exception-be-in-a-state-s-abortion-ban" target="_blank"&gt;with strict abortion laws. &lt;/a&gt;"We've slashed people's rights to make decisions," she says.

and long-term impact on our body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;A recent video from simulation pro Zack D Films has seemingly worked to put some people off, as showed the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/ozempic-aftermath-side-effects-warning-doctors-fasting-uk-123012-20250525"&gt;brutal way&lt;/a&gt; in which the drug works to reduce fat in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Once &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/ozempic"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; is in your bloodstream, it activates the parts of the brain that make you feel full, reducing your appetite," he said in the clip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"It also stabilises your blood sugar, stopping sudden cravings. Then it slows down how fast your stomach empties food, which keeps you feeling full for longer after a meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"This causes you to lose weight as you eat less. But it can make some people feel sick and even give them diarrhoea."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Ozempic has become a controversial way for people to lose weight (Getty Stock)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;And now, a doctor has given yet another reason why those looking to lose weight should stick to more common methods, rather than turning to Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;In a &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/youtube"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; short, Dr Boz, a doctor and content creator with close to one million followers &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ygdxz057KM0"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: "Ozempic should not be allowed for weight loss. Mark my words, put them in a time capsule and open it in 15 years. Ozempic has a remarkable weight loss but what they didn't focus on is that when these people are losing weight, they are losing muscle mass at a way higher rate than they should.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"As you play this forward, especially in elder patients, when you lose that much muscle mass, you cannot gain it back without extreme measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"The chemistry behind how they are losing that weight is really a starvation weight loss. This is the kind of weight loss that will decrease their immune system, decrease their muscle mass, decrease their bone density and decrease their longevity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;So, if you're planning on taking Ozempic to lose weight, be wary that you might be doing some significant long-term damage which involves losing muscle mass as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Novo Nordisk, Ozempic's manufacturer, told LADbible Group: "Wegovy®▼ (semaglutide injection) and Ozempic® (semaglutide injection) are prescription only medicines and require a healthcare professional to prescribe under strict supervision. Treatment decisions should be made together with a healthcare provider who can evaluate the appropriateness of using a GLP-1 based on assessment of a patient’s individual medical profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Patient safety is of the utmost importance to Novo Nordisk. We continuously collect safety data on our marketed GLP-1 RA medicines and work closely with the authorities to ensure patient safety. As part of this work we continue to monitor reports of adverse drug reactions through routine pharmacovigilance. Regarding safety, the most common adverse events among people treated with Ozempic® (semaglutide injection) for its indicated use, are gastrointestinal events including nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium is a necessary mineral for many bodily processes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Too much sodium increases the risk of heart disease and high blood pressure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many canned foods, like beans and beets, can still be eaten—even when watching your sodium.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Are you trying to watch your sodium intake? Most people take in far too much, and excessive consumption can increase their risk of heart disease and high blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And keeping sodium intake in check is even more important for those who already have high blood pressure, which is nearly half of the adult population in the U.S.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have high blood pressure, canned goods are likely on your do-not-eat list because of their bad reputation for being high in sodium. In fact, canned soups are one of the “salty six:” popular foods identified by the American Heart Association as culprits for &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-do-if-you-ate-too-much-sodium-last-night-8770796" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;excess dietary sodium intake&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But before you write off canned goods for good—and miss out on a host of nutrient-dense and convenient staples—we’re here to reassure you that they can still be a part of a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7834741/healthy-high-blood-pressure-meal-plan-for-beginners/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;blood pressure-friendly diet&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adopting the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938379/the-1-diet-to-lower-high-blood-pressure-according-to-science/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to be a solid strategy for preventing and treating high blood pressure. A pillar of the DASH diet is to limit dietary sodium to no more than 2,300 milligrams per day, which is 1 teaspoon of salt. Canned foods can be quite high in sodium, so look for low-sodium or no-salt-added options. Draining and rinsing canned foods can also reduce sodium by up to 40%.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, like many diets, the DASH diet emphasizes the importance of fruits and vegetables. But here’s one thing: It doesn’t specify that they must be fresh. Canned produce is still packed with the same heart-healthy nutrients. The same goes for high-quality canned proteins like fish and legumes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In this article, we’ll review what to look for on canned food labels when shopping and the top canned foods for high blood pressure recommended by dietitians. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-canned-sardines"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Canned Sardines &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Canned sardines are packed with omega-3 fatty acids and calcium, both beneficial for blood pressure. Omega 3s help lower blood pressure by reducing inflammation, and calcium is an important mineral in the DASH diet, an eating pattern designed to lower blood pressure,” says &lt;a href="https://www.veronicarouse.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Veronica Rouse, M.A.N., RD, CDE&lt;/a&gt;, owner of The Heart Dietitian.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just one (5-ounce) can of sardines provides a significant amount of heart-healthy omega-3s, along with 18 grams of protein and 20% to 25% of the Daily Value for calcium, which is 1,300 mg.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Not sure how to use canned sardines? Try them in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250047/greek-salad-with-sardines/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Greek Salad with Sardines&lt;/a&gt;. Since sardines can be high in sodium, we recommend enjoying 1 cup of this salad instead of the recommended serving size, which is 2 cups. Or buy no-salt-added sardines and enjoy the full serving size.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There’s a lot to love about a humble can of beans, as it's a versatile pantry staple that is budget-friendly, convenient and nutrient-dense. “Eating canned beans is a great way to help keep your blood pressure in line,” says &lt;a href="https://www.lauramali.com/laura-ali-registered-dietitian-nutritionist/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Laura M. Ali, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a culinary nutritionist based in Pittsburgh, and author of the cookbook &lt;em&gt;MIND Diet for Two&lt;/em&gt;. “They are a good source of potassium, magnesium and fiber—nutrients that are important for blood pressure control. You can find a variety of low-sodium options, too.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Studies have linked higher intakes of legumes (like beans) with lower blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Just a half-cup of low-sodium canned black beans provides a whopping 8 grams of fiber, 7 grams of protein, and blood pressure-lowering micronutrients like calcium and potassium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; More specifically, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/calcium-benefits-8649279" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;calcium plays a crucial role&lt;/a&gt; in controlling blood flow by regulating the narrowing and widening of blood vessels. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Choosing the low-sodium option provides about half the sodium of a typical can of black beans.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Enjoy this beautiful &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/one-pot-white-bean-spinach-sun-dried-tomato-orzo-with-lemon-feta-8415910" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;One-Pot White Bean, Spinach &amp;amp; Sun-Dried Tomato Orzo with Lemon &amp;amp; Feta&lt;/a&gt; while helping to protect your heart.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned tomatoes are a versatile pantry staple that can be used in many dishes, from pasta to soup and sauces. They are also loaded with heart-healthy benefits. A half-cup serving of canned crushed tomatoes with no added salt is not only low in sodium but also provides 10% of the Daily Value for potassium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Potassium helps counteract the effects of sodium by promoting its elimination through urine and by relaxing blood vessel walls. Additionally, canned tomatoes are rich in lycopene, a heart-healthy antioxidant that can help prevent cardiovascular disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For a delicious, heart-healthy dinner using canned tomatoes, make this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250239/tomato-soup/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Tomato Soup&lt;/a&gt; (serve it with our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7964556/spinach-artichoke-dip-grilled-cheese/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Spinach &amp;amp; Artichoke Dip Grilled Cheese&lt;/a&gt; for a complete meal!).

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that adults eat 8 ounces of seafood weekly.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, many Americans don’t eat enough. No-salt-added canned tuna is one of our go-to picks; It’s budget-friendly, versatile and packed with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3s&lt;/a&gt;, which can lower blood pressure. In fact, a review that included almost 5,000 participants found that just 2 grams of omega-3s daily significantly lowered blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; A 3-ounce portion of canned tuna not only provides 22 grams of high-quality protein, but it’s also a good source of calcium and potassium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Need some inspiration? Give this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/7939121/avocado-tuna-spinach-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Avocado Tuna Spinach Salad&lt;/a&gt; a try. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-canned-pumpkin"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Canned Pumpkin &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Next time you shop for pantry staples, add a can of potassium-rich pumpkin to your cart. “Incorporating more potassium-rich foods like canned pumpkin can help balance out the negative side effects of salt on your blood pressure,” says Rouse.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A 1-cup serving of canned pumpkin with no added salt has around 11% of the Daily Value for potassium, which is 4,700 mg.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Canned pumpkin is not just for pumpkin pie," says Rouse. "I use it all year round in overnight oats, pumpkin oatmeal, and my kids love pumpkin muffins.” These &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/267653/pumpkin-oat-mini-muffins/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Healthy Pumpkin Muffins&lt;/a&gt; are perfect for a heart-healthy breakfast on the go or a sweet midday snack. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-canned-pineapple"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Canned Pineapple &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fresh pineapple isn’t always readily available throughout the year, so canned pineapple packed in juice is a reliable alternative. Not only is this popular tropical fruit delicious, but it may also help lower your blood pressure. A 1-cup serving of cubed pineapple has over 2 grams of fiber and is a good source of potassium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fiber has been associated with helping reduce the risk of heart disease and lower blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Swap canned pineapple for fresh in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8029298/pineapple-salsa/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Pineapple Salsa&lt;/a&gt; for your next taco night or sip on a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/251038/pineapple-green-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Pineapple Green Smoothie&lt;/a&gt; for breakfast.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-7-canned-spinach"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 7. Canned Spinach &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned spinach may not be as popular as fresh and frozen, but we think Popeye may have been onto something. Canned spinach contains a host of health-promoting nutrients, including ones that can lower blood pressure. One cup of canned spinach has over 5 grams of fiber as well as blood pressure-friendly potassium, magnesium and calcium.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Green leafy vegetables like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8051884/the-1-vegetable-for-lowering-blood-pressure-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;spinach&lt;/a&gt; also contain nitrates, which help blood vessels relax, lowering blood pressure. One study found that those who consumed at least 1 cup of leafy greens per day had lower blood pressure and a lower overall risk of heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Add canned spinach to quiche, pasta and smoothies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-8-canned-beets"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 8. Canned Beets &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Bright red and full of antioxidants, canned beets are an excellent choice for helping to maintain a healthy blood pressure,” says Ali. “They contain a variety of heart-healthy nutrients, including fiber, potassium, vitamin C and B vitamins. In addition, their beautiful red color comes from plant compounds called phytonutrients, including one called betalains—a nutrient that has been shown to help reduce inflammation and may contribute to lowering blood pressure”.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like spinach, beets are also naturally rich in nitrates, which Ali says may help lower blood pressure and decrease heart risk. Save time by using canned beets in our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/269012/tuna-white-bean-dill-salad/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Tuna, White Bean &amp;amp; Dill Salad&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned foods are known to be higher in sodium. And if you’re trying to limit your sodium intake to manage high blood pressure, you may have been avoiding them. But don’t toss them out yet! Canned foods still have a lot to offer, including other blood pressure-friendly nutrients like fiber, potassium, calcium, magnesium and omega-3s. Plus, most companies make low-sodium or no-salt-added options for most of these foods. Use this list to stock your pantry with staples that will make it much easier to plan heart-healthy meals to manage your blood pressure. &lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His first healthy habit? Train your muscles. “Resistance training is a must if you want to live a long time. That’s because muscle mass is a longevity predictor. You don’t have to be a super buff bodybuilder. You just want to have enough muscle to be strong. Muscle keeps you mobile, helps you maintain metabolic health and blood sugar control, and makes you look good!” he says. “An easy way to start is with &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/over-40-best-exercises-for-muscle-maintenance/" target="_blank"&gt;four movements in the gym&lt;/a&gt; – push-ups, pull-ups, squats and deadlifts. If you can’t do these, use the machines or make adjustments as needed. If you don’t have access to a gym, you can use resistance bands at home.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, work on improving your VO2 max. “Your VO2 max is a measure of how much oxygen your body consumes during exercise. Scientific studies associate a higher VO2 max with living longer,” he says. “The best way to improve your VO2 max is with interval sprint training. Go to a park and warm up with a slow walk. Then, sprint for 30 seconds, all-out like a tiger is chasing you. Then go back to a slow walk and recover until your heart rate goes back to normal. Repeat the sprint/rest cycle 6-8 times. If you live near an Upgrade Labs, come in and try our AI Adaptive Bike. It gives you a personalized workout based on your fitness levels and the best part is that it only takes 5 minutes! Studies show it improves your VO2 max by 12% in just 8 weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleeping better will help you live longer, according to Asprey. “Focus on quality over quantity. If you track your sleep (which I highly recommend – see #8) aim for around 1.5 hours of deep sleep and 1.5 hours of REM sleep each night.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation is also key. “Meditation eliminates stress, which is a major driver of aging. You can meditate in a variety of different ways.

&lt;p&gt;Embrace BICEP, says Asprey. “I recently introduced a new concept in my book, Heavily Meditated. It’s called BICEP and it stands for Brief Intentional Conscious Exposure to Pain. This is why biohackers love cold plunges, why Texans love hot peppers, and why some people are addicted to getting tattoos. When you regularly do hard things for a brief amount of time your body becomes more resilient. You also reset your dopamine sensitivity, which means that life will feel easier and more pleasurable in general. Cold plunges, sauna, and high-intensity exercise are three forms of BICEP you can start doing today that will make you more resilient and support your longevity,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Build your community,” Asprey encourages.  “Not only is building community great for growth and self-improvement, it’s also good for your biology. Studies show that people who have stronger social connections live longer. Join a local club with people who are interested in the same things as you. Face-to-face interactions are best.”&lt;span aria-hidden="true"&gt;6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Feel gratitude daily,” Asprey continues. “Like meditation, gratitude can help reduce stress and support longevity. Start a gratitude journal. Every morning and every evening, write down 3 things you’re grateful for. This is the key – sit for a few minutes and actually FEEL the gratitude in your body. Gratitude is a feeling, not an emotion. To get the benefits, you have to feel it in your body. Maybe it feels like a warm glow around your chest. Perhaps you feel it in your hands and feet. Sit with the feeling for a few minutes each time you write in your journal. Gratitude is a muscle. You have to exercise it daily to get results.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Track your metrics. “Sure, you’re doing all of the things, but how do you know they’re working? And how do you know what’s best for you? Your biology is unique so what works for you won’t work for your neighbor. I recommend that everyone gets comprehensive labs done regularly. This is to ensure your hormones, inflammation, and nutrient levels are in the right range. I also recommend tracking metrics with an AI-powered wearable like the Oura ring. This way you can see how you’re sleeping and how well you’re recovering. Daily metrics can help guide you in refining your routine or modifying it depending on what your body is telling you on that specific day,” Asprey says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, filter your water and air. “We live in a toxic world. You might go out of your way to buy organic vegetables or unprocessed foods, but do you ever think about the air you breathe or the water you drink? Tap water can contain microplastics, heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, PFAS (forever chemicals), and more. You don’t want those in your body. They’re not good for longevity. The best strategy is to get a whole-home reverse osmosis water filter. You also want to make sure your air is clean. Breathing in pollutants can cause body-wide oxidative stress and age you rapidly. A high-quality air filter is a must!” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, get your DAKE and minerals. “Vitamin and mineral deficiencies can cause cellular dysfunction and contribute to accelerated aging. While some people will argue that a whole-food diet is sufficient to meet nutrient needs, this just isn’t true – at least if you want to thrive and live a long time,” Asprey says. “Our food isn’t what it used to be – our soil is depleted and therefore our food doesn’t have as many nutrients as it did in the past. The two most important categories of nutrients that I recommend you take are vitamin DAKE (fat-soluble vitamins D,A,K, and E) and minerals. Minerals are crucial for life as they power every reaction that goes on in your body. If you don’t have enough minerals, you’ll feel it. I recommend taking a high-quality mineral blend like the one from my company Suppgrade Labs. It contains all of the right forms in the right ratios that your body needs. Fat soluble vitamins D,A,K, and E shuttle minerals around to where they need to go to perform their actions. Suppgrade Labs also makes a high-quality Vitamin DAKE supplement that contains the most bioavailable forms of these vitamins in the correct amounts that will support your energy levels and longevity goals.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

One of her last words was that she wished she had taken the vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine (SMFM), experts on high-risk pregnancy, said in a statement that it “strongly reaffirms its recommendation that pregnant patients receive the Covid-19 vaccine”, and that the vaccine is safe to receive at any time during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In a statement, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) said it was “concerned about and extremely disappointed”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We also understand that despite the change in recommendations from [health and human services], the science has not changed,” said Dr Steven J Fleischman, ACOG president. “It is very clear that Covid-19 infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability, and it can cause devastating consequences for families,” said Fleischman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy made &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/27/rfk-jr-covid-vaccine-kids-pregnant-women" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the announcement&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday on social media, flanked by Trump administration appointees to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) – neither of whom are typically involved in such decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Typically, changes to the recommended vaccine schedule are based on open public debate and the recommendation of an independent panel of experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s advisory committee on immunization practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Kennedy’s announcement circumvented both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and its advisory panel, and neither body was advised of the forthcoming decision, sources told &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/27/covid-shots-pregnant-women-children-recommendation-change-hhs-secretary-kennedy/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;STAT&lt;/a&gt;. The CDC is currently without a leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A directive making the change official, also reported by &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/27/covid-shots-pregnant-women-children-recommendation-change-hhs-secretary-kennedy/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;STAT&lt;/a&gt;, suggested that Kennedy reviewed the evidence with the FDA. That agency’s advisory committee, which is structured similarly to the CDC’s, was also bypassed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Just a week earlier, the FDA’s head, Dr Marty Makary, published a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/20/fda-vaccine-framework-new-covid-shot-recommendations-vinay-prasad-marty-makary/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;similarly unprecedented&lt;/a&gt; article in the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2506929" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; that described pregnancy and recent pregnancy as on a list of “underlying medical conditions that can increase a person’s risk of severe Covid-19”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;As of Tuesday, the CDC’s website continued to state that those who are pregnant are at increased risk of severe illness if they contract Covid-19, including heightened risk of hospitalization and the need for intensive care. Further, evidence shows that mothers who are vaccinated pass protective immunity to infants, without the many risks that come alongside Covid-19 infection during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Infants younger than six months old are at the highest risk of severe disease among children, with the risk to children younger than four years old on par with that of 50-to-64-year-old adults, according to the Journal article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Kennedy’s unilateral decision to change the CDC’s recommended immunization schedule for Covid-19 vaccines demonstrates once again why he is completely unqualified to be the HHS secretary,” said Dr Robert Steinbrook, research director at consumer rights group Public Citizen, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“In Congressional testimony on May 14, Kennedy said, ‘I don’t think people should be taking medical advice from me.’ Yet two weeks later he is making arbitrary public health decisions, defying norms, and with no accountability.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Despite the known risks of contracting Covid-19 while pregnant, public health authorities have struggled to get pregnant people vaccinated. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covidvaxview/weekly-dashboard/pregnant-women-vaccination.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Dr Karen Della Corte, lead author and a BYU nutritional science professor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While seeming healthy, fruit juice is known to have a high sugar content as they tend to have added sugars and additives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even with added vitamins and nutrients, the high added sugar content in juices can overwhelm and disrupt liver metabolism - increasing liver and pancreas fat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, this can lead to inflammation and result in problems with insulin release and absorption in the body - paving the way for Type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As compared to whole fruits, juice also lacks the beneficial fiber, which can disrupt gut health and impact metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have long recmmended eating whole fruits instead of drinking branded juices as they packed with fiber, which is essential for gut health, regulating blood sugar levels and keeping you feeling full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commercial juices, often have little to no fiber as it's removed during the juicing process to make the liquid free-flowing and more flavorful. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The skin and pulp of whole fruits also contains valuable vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that are often discarded during juicing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to its natural origin, honey too can be a healthier option to consume rather than fruit juices as it does not cause as rapid a spike in blood sugar and contains trace amounts of vitamins as well as minerals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Della Corte said: 'This study underscores the need for even more stringent recommendations for liquid sugars such as those in sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice, as they appear to harmfully associate with metabolic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Rather than condemning all added sugars, future dietary guidelines might consider the differential effects of sugar based on its source and form.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was published in the journal Advances in Nutrition in May 2025.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>dailymail.co.uk</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 16:05:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxQS0MyZlZZS0pnYzFCamVXbzVpQ2RwWWJwa0k2dENtMzhxcTNUYy1ZMExmNEMwNV93d05ZczRYaWJOVzlhZHZWWE83SnhIMGZSRHhPMUp4cndkendwSXE5VnljUE1HbkV3SE9QSk1oWWJ4aDkydHEyMkh0REhHemRsNm5VUUFEUjFoOG9odE1RYk0wTkVHRTRZZFotT3RINVpKd3B3aXhFONIBrAFBVV95cUxNV1lDMExjamt1UzVuS0NVc0dLUFZIRlI0aUpBOTU5b1A0UWhrTkF6TDBUYVZjQUJIZERyb01ENWlneVJfeDdYX0o2cWtVQmtVZWVSYU5Pdk96YVQ1ZHVTdlFIM3ZhWnVpRXNZXzBiRWJ3NGFZMXM0YjBsRE9NX05MNkQ3dkx0TzYydzc2clA2bjlGQVFlaDRkeDhwaTYtWTZQNnctekl2djBRT2Jk</guid></item><item><title>两种不同的宿主专用真菌物种导致蝙蝠患白鼻病-自然 | Two distinct host-specialized fungal species cause white-nose disease in bats - Nature</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX0FVX3lxTE1kdEN2bEtqLTJYa2dYYU05c25vM2J6MkdQbWluVzVvLXhhME1hZUZpV1J1WG5tcE1oZGo5bU5EQjRWcWFYMkdzaXl3dzN5WGFMUGNRbVd0LUFPX0dtT0xj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-article-section__content" id="Sec5-content"&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec6"&gt;Sample and field data collection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swab samples of &lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;destructans&lt;/i&gt; were collected from bat hibernacula.

After observing germination, typically 3–5 days after plating, plates were screened with a microscope to identify germinated single spores (identified as colonies expanding from a single germinating spore). Depending on availability, 1–3 (mean = 3.0, median = 3) and 1–5 (mean = 3.6, median = 2) single spores were typically isolated from bat and wall swabs, respectively. Isolation was performed by excising a plug with a sterile 3-mm biopsy punch and transferring it to a fresh 6-cm Petri dish. The plates were then visually monitored for 1 week to confirm that no additional spores germinated on the plug. Plates were grown at 10−15 °C until there was sufficient material to extract DNA (usually after several weeks to months). Each of these colonies is then referred to as an isolate or a culture. DNA extraction was done using a KingFisher Flex extraction robot (Thermo Scientific) with a MagMAX Plant DNA Isolation kit (Thermo Scientific). After DNA extraction, isolates were genotyped using 18 microsatellite markers and two mating-type markers in four multiplexes.

We used a sorbitol wash buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.35 M sorbitol, 5 mM EDTA pH 8.0 and 1% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP-40)) to clean the fungal material and to remove most of the culture medium from the hyphae (the wash was repeated twice with 5 min of incubation at room temperature each time). After removing the sorbitol wash buffer the second time (through centrifugation and removal of the liquid supernatant), 500 μl CTAB lysis buffer (preheated to 65 °C; 0.01 M Tris HCl pH 7.5, 25 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 1.5 M NaCl and 2% CTAB powder (w/v)), 30 μl proteinase K and 5 μl 1 M DTT were added for digestion and incubated overnight at 56 °C, mixing material after the first hour. After letting samples cool for 5 min at room temperature, 4 μl RNase A was added and left to incubate at room temperature for 10 min. One volume chloroform–isoamyl alcohol (24:1 v/v) was added, after which tubes were inverted 30 times and centrifuged for 5 min at maximum speed, keeping the supernatant. We then added a second step of proteinase K (30 μl) and RNase A (4 μl) treatment with an incubation for 30 min at 56 °C, as it was found to reduce the presence of RNA and result in better quality DNA.

A total of four pools were prepared per clade with each isolate appearing in one pool only. For &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1, a total of 69 isolates were used (pool sizes: 17, 17, 17 and 18 isolates), whereas for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2, a total of 63 isolates was used (pool sizes: 15, 16, 16 and 16 isolates). Within clades, isolates were assigned to a pool on the basis of the DNA concentration of their extracts (that is, the 17 and 15 isolates with highest DNA concentration for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2, respectively, were pooled together). The strategy of pooling samples into four pools per clade was used to validate the consistency of the results generated by each pool individually and the combined dataset (see the section ‘Genotyping’). Isolates were chosen to maximize both the geographical distance among sites and the genotypic richness within each clade. After DNA extraction (and quantification) of each isolate, DNA was combined to result in equal concentrations of isolates with a total of 500 ng DNA in a volume of 60 μl per pool.

Across all isolates, the allelic richness was high, ranging from 10 to 93 alleles per locus (mean = 37); however, we found that some alleles were fixed in the &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 clade (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;).

A genealogical interpretation of principal components analysis.

To achieve this, we chose 51 sites (the same number of sites in which &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 was found) from &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 in a way that maximized geographical distance among them (that is, thinning sites) and used up to 20 isolates per site (again, to ensure that sampling among sites was not markedly uneven). This resulted in a dataset containing 234 and 92 isolates for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2, respectively, over 51 sites each (using unique MLGs only). PCA was then performed using this &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 dataset subset and the full dataset for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2. The results revealed two clusters, which were completely differentiated. The position of the North American isolates on the PCA plot was simply determined a posteriori by projecting or predicting their coordinates using the function ‘suprow’. Considering that maximizing distance among sites may also have an influence, we confirmed these findings on the Eurasian dataset by randomly subsampling 51 sites of &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 repeatedly (100,000 times, but with the number of isolates per site still capped at 20) without considering the geographical distance between chosen sites. After running these 100,000 subsampled PCAs (with &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 unchanged, the geographically thinned PCA run was added, which resulted in a total of 100,001 PCAs), the density of values observed for PC1 was consistent with the values obtained for the thinned dataset, which indicated that the signal of differentiation between &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 was strong and independent of geography or identity of the chosen sites (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#Fig1"&gt;1b&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also used the microsatellite dataset to investigate the presence of population differentiation in each of the discovered clades. For this purpose, we investigated only Eurasian isolates (that is, excluding the 33 isolates from the United States) and treated &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we used DAPC&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 33" title="Jombart, T., Devillard, S. &amp;amp; Balloux, F.

If populations from different sites are genetically differentiated, one would expect the DAPC to assign isolates to their true site of origin (that is, where they were sampled) more often than expected by chance. Here each isolate was probabilistically assigned to sites based on the observed allele frequencies (no assumptions were made, for example, about the independence of loci). Each isolate was run in an independent DAPC, which resulted in a set of 2,191 and 279 DAPCs for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2, respectively (excluding all isolates from North America and with a limited number of 20 isolates per site, see also Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;; 120 PCA axes and 100 discriminant analysis (&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) axes retained in all runs). As some isolates will always be correctly assigned by chance, it was important to quantify the percentage of correct assignments by chance compared with correct assignments based on observed allele frequencies. Hence, we ran the same sets of DAPCs after randomizing the site names (independently for each run) to ascertain the frequency of correct assignments occurring by chance and the expected distances between the isolates’ site of origin and their assigned sites if assignment was no better than random (randomized DAPC). The distances between assigned sites and sites of origin are presented in the main article for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#Fig3"&gt;3b&lt;/a&gt;) and in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#Fig13"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify the European sites of origin of the North American introduction, we performed two separate analyses with two different methods: multivariate analyses (DAPC&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 33" title="Jombart, T., Devillard, S. &amp;amp; Balloux, F.

Accurate continuous geographic assignment from low- to high-density SNP data.

DAPC analyses assign samples to sites already contained in the dataset, whereas the SPASIBA method can perform continuous assignment to any location (that is, coordinates) in the range defined by the user. First, we built a DAPC with all 5,162 &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 isolates from 226 sites in Europe (the site in the Ural Mountains was excluded). The aim of this DAPC was to differentiate sites; hence, sites were used as pre-defined groups. We then used the ‘predict.dapc’ function from the adegenet R package to predict site memberships of the 33 isolates from North America. Running the DAPC while limiting the number of isolates per site to 20 provided identical assignment results. Second, we used the SPASIBA model, a spatial Bayesian inference (SPASIBA) method for geospatial assignment that models the spatial frequency of alleles by a set of spatially autocorrelated random variables with Gaussian distribution. Implementation was carried out in R using the SPASIBA (v.24.6.27) and INLA (v.0.0.4) packages based on the same dataset as described above for the DAPC analysis. That is 5,162 &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 isolates from 226 sites in Europe for the reference data (‘geno.ref’) and 33 isolates from 9 sites in North America as individuals of unknown geographical origin to be assigned (‘geno.unknown’). For SPASIBA, we used the function ‘SPASIBA.inf’ with a ploidy level of 1 and a flat domain (sphere = false). To achieve a uniform spatial resolution, we configured the grid to consist of 198 pixels in longitude and 120 pixels in latitude. This setup ensured a consistent resolution across both dimensions, with each pixel representing an approximate resolution of 0.169°. To identify the most probable source of introduction inferred across the 33 North American isolates, we calculated the average assignment likelihood for each pixel across the 33 isolates (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;), from which we computed the log-likelihood for representation (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#Fig4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The visualization of EEMS (&lt;a href="https://github.com/dipetkov/eems"&gt;https://github.com/dipetkov/eems&lt;/a&gt;) was used to evaluate geographical barriers linked to patterns of gene flow&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 35" title="Petkova, D., Novembre, J. &amp;amp; Stephens, M.

This method differs from PCA in that genetic differentiation is visualized as a function of migration rates rather than through genetic or genotypic distance. This method uses a population genetic model to compare expected pairwise genetic dissimilarities in relation to their geographical distances (that is, under a model of isolation-by-distance) with observed patterns across the sampled area. Specifically, a triangular grid with specific density (number of demes) is built over the area containing geo-referenced samples. For the edge of each grid, the migration parameter is estimated by Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, which means that migration is estimated in an approximated stepping-stone model between neighbouring grid cells. As sampling locations will fall into the same or neighbouring cells depending on the grid cell size, the number of demes (defining the overall density of grid cells and hence their size) influences the outcome of estimated migration rates (particularly at small geographical scales). For this reason, we calculated the EEMS for a range of deme sizes (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8, 100–450 demes) in independent runs of 8 million iterations each (after a burn-in of 1 million iterations), as previously recommended&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 35" title="Petkova, D., Novembre, J. &amp;amp; Stephens, M.

It should be noted that estimated migration rates are most accurate closer to sampling locations and less accurate in sparsely sampled geographical areas. For this reason, in addition to clone-correction based on site identity (each genotype appears only once per site, additional occurrences are removed), the Russian isolates were excluded before calculating EEMS for both clades. This resulted in a total of 2,261 isolates used for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and 107 isolates for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;). Markers Pd10 and Pd14 were uninformative for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 and hence removed for the EEMS (removed for the &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 dataset only), which left a dataset with 16 markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phylogenetic relationships between the 5,479 isolates (or 1,866 MLGs) were reconstructed using Nei’s ‘Da’ genetic distance and Cavalli–Sforza and Edwards Chord distance ‘Dch’, as both distance measures were found to be the best performing ones to retrieve the relationships between individuals&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 56" title="Takezaki, N. &amp;amp; Nei, M.

In the synteny network, genes represent nodes, and syntenic relationships between genes are represented by edges connecting the nodes. A median average clustering coefficient of 0.95 was obtained across parameter settings (min–max: 0.94–0.95%; Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;), which revealed that genes tend to form a complete subgraph or cluster with their syntenic neighbours across multiple genomes. Phylogenomic profiling was then performed using the inferred syntenic clusters, which resulted in a matrix m&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;ij&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; of the phylogenomic profiles, which represented the number of genes from cluster &lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt; that can be found in genome &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;. To reveal synteny clusters that were conserved and clade-specific clusters, clusters were visualized as a heatmap with clusters clustered using Ward’s clustering on a matrix of Euclidean distance (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#Fig2"&gt;2e&lt;/a&gt;).

Fastp (v.0.23.4) was used to remove bases with a phred quality value lower than 30 (‘-q 30’). Subsequently, bwa-mem2 (v.2.2.1) was used to align the Illumina reads to each of the two reference genomes (Gd293 for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and Gd45 for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2). Samtools view (v.1.16.1) was used to only keep reads with mapped (-F 0×4), properly paired (‘-f 0×2’), and high-confidence mapping quality (MAPQ values of 60: ‘-q 60’). Samtools sort and Samtools index were used to respectively sort and index the obtained BAM files. Reads were assigned using Picard (v.2.27.1) and the AddOrReplaceReadGroups tool. The SortSam tool (from Picard) was used to sort the BAM file by queryname (QNAME) before removing duplicate reads using the MarkDuplicates tool (from Picard). SortSam was subsequently used to sort the BAM file by coordinate before indexing using Samtools index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec24"&gt;Base calling, genotyping and filtering&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We then performed base calling with ‘gatk HaplotypeCaller’ (gatk v.4.2.6.1) using the ‘-ERC BP_RESOLUTION’ mode and a ploidy of 1. Genotyping was done with ‘gatk GenotypeGVCFs’. ‘gatk SelectVariants’ was then used to extract the non-variable positions in one file and the variable positions (SNP only) in another file (insertions and deletions were discarded). Hard filtering of variable positions that did not meet the criteria ‘QUAL &amp;lt; 30.0’, ‘QUAL/DP &amp;lt; 2.0’, ‘SOR &amp;gt; 3.0’, ‘FS &amp;gt; 60.0’, ‘DP &amp;lt; 20.0’ and ‘MQ &amp;lt; 40.0’ was carried out using ‘gatk VariantFiltration’ and ‘gatk SelectVariants’. Isolate genotypes with a read depth lower than 20× at a given position were set to no-call. ‘gatk SortVcf’ was then used to merge the filtered variable and non-variable positions into a single VCF file. ‘bedtools subtract’ was subsequently used to remove masked positions from the reference genome and positions called as heterozygous when considering the isolates as diploid (see the section ‘Filtering repetitive DNA’).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each contig of each of the two reference genomes (Gd293 and Gd45), we then checked for the mean read depth, when mapping the 18 isolates to each reference genome, to detect unusually high read depth that would indicate the presence of repetitive sequences in the regions that nevertheless passed our filters described above. For each contig, we also checked for the average number of isolates with missing data per position to identify contigs with high levels of missing data. For Gd45, out of eight contigs that were smaller than 50 kb, two had no reads mapped, and five out of the six remaining had unusual mean read depth (lower or higher than other contigs) and/or a high average number of isolates with missing data (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, all eight contigs below 50 kb, representing in total only 0.46% of the Gd45 genome were excluded from the analyses. For Gd293, all contigs were larger than 50 kb and a single contig (contig_44) deviated from the values observed for other contigs by having a read depth about 100× higher than other contigs and having on average 13 isolates with missing data per position (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;). This contig, most likely an accessory chromosome with a high proportion of repetitive sequences, was therefore excluded from further analyses. After all filtering steps were performed (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;), the average read depths were 237 and 240 when mapping on Gd293 and Gd45, respectively. The correlation between the read depths of the 18 genomes when mapped on Gd293 and Gd45 was 0.996 (Spearman’s rank correlation &lt;i&gt;ρ&lt;/i&gt;; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), which highlighted that the mapping worked equally well on either reference genome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, each isolate had a genotype for over 95% of positions (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;). In the end, we obtained data on 21,609,224 positions when using Gd293 as the reference (including 92,593 biallelic SNPs) and 22,041,192 positions when using Gd45 as the reference (including 95,638 biallelic SNPs). These data were stored in a single VCF file (with 18 samples) per reference genome. Furthermore, to evaluate the quality of our full procedure, we checked the number of differences obtained by mapping the Illumina reads of Gd293 to the de novo-assembled MinION genome (reference genome Gd293, see the section ‘Genome assembly’ for assembly details). We did a similar analysis for Gd45 mapped to the reference genome Gd45. For Gd293, the number of differences with the reference genome (itself) was 19 variants out of 23,660,591 positions in the final VCF file, which indicated a combined mapping, base calling and genotyping error rate of 8.030231 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–7&lt;/sup&gt;; that is 1 error every 1,245,294 bp, which corresponded to a quality score of Q60.95. For Gd45 (mapped on the reference genome Gd45), the error rate was also extremely low: 2.444712 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–6&lt;/sup&gt; (54 variants out of 22,088,490 bp), or 1 error every 409,046 bp (Q56.11). These data provide evidence that our pipeline, which incorporated several stringent filters, recovered highly reliable SNPs while preserving a large amount of data (&amp;gt;22 Mb accounting for around 60% of the reference genomes).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec25"&gt;Diversity and differentiation calculation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic diversity π was calculated per clade (11 for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and 7 for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2) across 50 kb windows using pixy (v.1.2.7.beta1), which takes into account missing data in calculations and hence provides unbiased estimates&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 89" title="Korunes, K.

Each of these partition methods were used in combination with each of the two reference genomes (Gd293 and Gd45; see the section ‘Data checking and mapping’), which resulted in a total of four datasets. All four datasets converged towards the same topology, recovering &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 as two reciprocally monophyletic clades (Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#Fig2"&gt;2b&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM1"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec27"&gt;BUSCO phylogeny&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To produce the phylogenetic tree using newly sequenced and publicly available BUSCO genes of the isolates, we used all single copy, complete orthologues as identified from the fungi odb10 database, that were common to all 18 isolates (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;i&gt;Pseudogymnoascus&lt;/i&gt; sp. outgroup (isolate Gd267).

We used vcftools with the ‘missing-site’ function to extract missingness on a per-site basis from the VCF file containing the genotypes of the 19 (18 + 1) individuals (see the section ‘Base calling, genotyping and filtering’). Then, we calculated the number of positions with no missing data over 10 kb non-overlapping windows and only kept windows with at least 5,000 positions with no missing data across the 19 isolates. For each of the 19 isolates, we then used BEDTools getfasta to extract sequences (FASTA format) from these windows. In each window, only positions without missing data (that is, minimum 5 kb) were kept. We obtained a total of 1,275 and 1,288 genomic partitions when using the reference genomes from each clade, Gd293 and Gd45, respectively. A concatenation-based species tree with edge-linked proportional partition model with 1,000 ultrafast bootstrap (-B 1000 -T AUTO) was then produced. This procedure was applied in parallel to the data mapped on reference genomes from each clade, Gd293 and Gd45 (VCF files).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec29"&gt;Analyses of recombination&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test for the presence of recombination in each of the two clades, we used two tests, the pairwise homoplasy index (PHI or Φw) test and the four-gamete test (FGT). The Φw test calculates a pairwise similarity index between closely linked sites (situated in &lt;i&gt;w&lt;/i&gt; bases) and compares observed values to values obtained after permutation of the sites. Under the null hypothesis of no recombination, the genealogical correlation between adjacent sites remains unchanged even if the order of the sites is shuffled. This is because all sites share the same evolutionary history when recombination is absent. However, when recombination occurs, the order of the sites becomes important as distant sites tend to have weaker genealogical correlations compared with adjacent sites&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 95" title="Bruen, T.

The FGT test involves counting the number of allelic combinations between any pair of SNPs on the same contig. Assuming an infinite site model, the observation of four combinations is incompatible with the absence of recombination. For example, if two SNPs have the alleles C/T and A/G, then the observation of the haplotypes CA, CG, TA and TG must be the result of a recombination event. We calculated the number of haplotypes using the script FGT.pl (&lt;a href="https://github.com/dbsloan/fgt"&gt;https://github.com/dbsloan/fgt&lt;/a&gt;). In each clade, we performed FGT on windows of 100 kb, with at least 20 kb of unmasked nucleotide positions and no missing data. We performed these analyses on the genomic data (Illumina data from individually tagged isolates) from the 18 isolates (11 from &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and 7 from &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2; described in section ‘Analyses of Illumina reads (individually tagged isolates)’) mapped on the reference genomes (Gd293 and Gd45) of &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 clades, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, we estimated the population recombination rate (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 2&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; is the recombination rate per bp per generation and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the effective population size) using LDhelmet software&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 97" title="Chan, A.

Default values were used for other parameters following the LDhelmet manual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apart from formal recombination tests carried out as explained above, we used the reconstructed phylogenetic tree obtained with microsatellite data (described in the section ‘Analyses of multilocus genotypes’) to map the two mating types. This analysis demonstrated the presence of both mating types in &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 clades, and the presence of both mating types throughout the phylogenetic tree depicting relationships between MLGs in each clade. These data provide further evidence for recombination in &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 clades (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec30"&gt;Modelling demographic history&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To model the evolutionary history of both clades, we implemented Approximate Bayesian Computation comparing two demographic models with and without contemporaneous migration. Specifically, we evaluated the isolation-migration model (IM) and the strict-isolation model (SI). These two models imply a population split at a time &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;split&lt;/sub&gt; in the past, but this event is followed by constant migration in the IM model or no migration in the SI model. The ancestral population and the derived population have an independent population size (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

One million simulations were performed for both models using a mutation rate of 1.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–9&lt;/sup&gt; mutation per site per generation, a recombination rate half of the mutation rate, a &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;split&lt;/sub&gt; between 10 and 10 million generations and an &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; between 10 and 10 million individuals per population. As performing the analyses on the full genome would be computationally too intensive (for the simulations part), we instead used a representative sample across the genome.

Parameter estimations were obtained using the neural network method implemented in the abc package using 5,000 simulations.

The rejection method led to the selection of the SI model 79% and 76% of the times for reference Gd293 and Gd45, respectively. Therefore, both model-selection methods support the model without contemporaneous migration.

Based on the SI model, the divergence time between &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 clades was estimated to have occurred between 114,000 and 1.5 generations ago (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec31"&gt;Analyses of Illumina reads (Pool-seq data)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec32"&gt;Data checking and mapping&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We checked and mapped the Illumina data (each of the four pools per clade) as detailed in the section ‘Data checking and mapping’ for Illumina reads above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec33"&gt;Data pooling&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each of &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2, we had four pools (hereafter called ‘subpools’) of isolates (with 17, 18, 17 and 17 isolates for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and 16, 16, 16 and 15 isolates for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2). Before combining the four subpools per clade, we calculated the number of reads per subpool and subsampled them with Samtools view to have the same number of reads per isolate (1,704,260 reads) in each subpool. We then used Samtools merge to merge BAM files for the four subpools per clade, which resulted in one final pool (pool of four subpools) of 69 isolates for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 (117,589,122 reads) and one final pool (pool of four subpools) of 63 isolates for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 (107,355,848 reads).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec34"&gt;Genotyping&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genotyping was carried out separately for each pool (one for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and one for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2), mapped on the reference genome from clade 1 and 2, which resulted in four separate analyses. Samtools mpileup was then used to generate pileup outputs from BAM files. For SNP calling, we applied a Bayesian approach specifically designed for pools (SNAPE-pooled&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 104" title="Guirao-Rico, S. &amp;amp; González, J.

SNAPE-pooled prior parameters were sets as follows: &lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt;  =  0.0005, &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;  =  0.0025 or &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0005 when mapping the pool on the reference from the different versus same clade respectively, prior = ‘informative’, fold = ‘folded’, and nchr = number of (haploid) isolates in the pool. We converted the SNAPE-pooled output file to a VCF and as recommended by the program developers, we only considered positions with a posterior probability ≥0.9 as being polymorphic. In all other cases, positions were marked as monomorphic. To avoid including sequencing errors as rare alleles, we adopted two complementary strategies. First, when converting the SNAPE-pooled output to a VCF, we only included alleles that were supported by at least five reads in the pool (that is, the four subpools together). Second, we performed SNAPE-pooled analyses on each subpool (with parameters as described above) to identify alleles that were not supported by at least two reads in two subpools. These alleles were then removed from the VCF file of the pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec35"&gt;Data filtering&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To limit false-positive SNPs, we applied further filters to the VCF file to remove the following: (1) regions where repetitive DNA elements were either confirmed or suspected; (2) regions with low or high read depth (based on the Pool-seq data); and (3) regions that were identified as problematic based on read depth of individually tagged isolates (see the section ‘Base calling, genotyping and filtering’ of Illumina reads).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec36"&gt;Filtering repetitive DNA&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The removal of regions with confirmed or suspected repetitive DNA (including paralogues) that could not be confidently mapped with short-read data was carried out using three complementary approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, we removed regions that were masked from the reference genome (see the section ‘Repeat annotation’).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, we removed regions suspected to contain hidden repetitive DNA. Although we removed regions that were masked from the reference genome (see above), a single or a set of genomes (18 in our case, see section ‘Repeat annotation’) is unlikely to harbour the full extent of the repertoire existing in repetitive DNA in a larger number of isolates such as in the Pool-seq dataset. Hidden repetitive DNA can generate spurious heterozygous genotypes that can confound the estimation of genetic differentiation between populations or species (for example, ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 106" title="Badouin, H. et al. Widespread selective sweeps throughout the genome of model plant pathogenic fungi and identification of effector candidates. Mol. Ecol. 26, 2041–2062 (2017)." href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#ref-CR106" id="ref-link-section-d29254788e3166"&gt;106&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). Hence, when using reads from an isolate that was not used to build the repeat library or the filters (for example, Pool-seq data), the unique mapping of its reads to a reference genome does not per se confirm that these reads originated from non-duplicated regions. We used levels of genetic diversity (π) as a proxy to detect hidden repetitive DNA. Repetitive DNA elements sharing a common ancestor accumulate mutations; therefore, when such loci (two or more copies) are erroneously merged together as a single locus, one expects higher levels of genetic diversity provided that everything else remains equal. We therefore removed regions with levels of π greater than 1%. This threshold was obtained by calculating the level of genetic diversity observed across 18 genomes rather than pools of individuals (see the section ‘Analyses of Illumina reads (individually tagged isolates)’; Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;) for which only 0.43% and 1.43% of sites for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2, respectively, showed π values greater than 1%. π was calculated per site using pixy (v.1.2.7.beta1), which takes into account missing data in calculations and hence provides unbiased estimates&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 89" title="Korunes, K.

Each of the 18 isolates (as listed in Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt; (except the outgroup)) were mapped against the reference genome (as per the section ‘Data checking and mapping’ for Illumina reads) and analysed in diploid mode (that is, considering that the isolate is diploid). For this, we used the same pipeline as for base calling isolates (with gatk; see the section ‘Analyses of Illumina reads (individually tagged isolates)’) but with ploidy of 2. Sites scored as heterozygote in at least one isolate were recorded in a BED file. A total of 183,756 heterozygote sites (spread across contigs) were identified in those 18 genomes when using Gd293 as the reference and 177,785 when using Gd45 as the reference. All those heterozygote sites were removed from all 18 genomes, irrespective the isolates they originated from. Although these data alone might indicate that &lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;destructans&lt;/i&gt; is diploid, results from the microsatellite analysis firmly refuted this hypothesis. Indeed, we genotyped 5,479 isolates originating from single spore (that is, monosporic isolation) cultures for 18 microsatellite loci (see the section ‘Cultures and genotyping’), and out of the 98,622 genotypes (5,479 × 18), we never encountered 2 alleles per locus for any single spore isolate. Two alleles for some loci and some isolates would be expected if &lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;destructans&lt;/i&gt; was diploid. Furthermore, such levels of heterozygosity have already been reported when base calling haploids in diploid mode in other fungal species (for example, ref. &lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 109" title="Li, X. et al.

These regions contained in the final BED file were then excluded from the VCF file in BEDTools substract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec37"&gt;Filtering based on read depth&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many species of fungi have accessory chromosomes, and the results from the section ‘Base calling, genotyping and filtering’ provide strong evidence that this is also the case for both of the &lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;destructans&lt;/i&gt; clades. As a result, stringent filtering based on read depth alone was not possible. We therefore only performed light filtering by setting sites with a read depth below 20× or above 600× per pool as missing data. Based on read depth and levels of missing data from individually tagged isolates (section ‘Data checking and mapping’ for Illumina reads; Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;), we identified a few problematic contigs that were also filtered out from the Pool-seq data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec38"&gt;Filtering outcomes&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The filtering steps described in the previous two sections resulted in a narrowing of the 95% highest density interval (hdi95) of the read depth for both clades when mapped to the reference genome of both clades (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM1"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;).

When using reference genome Gd293, &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 hdi95 narrowed down from 92–512 to 236–523 whereas &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 hdi95 narrowed down from 5–511 to 227–542. Positions filtered out were mostly, although not exclusively, positions with read depth less than 200 (Supplementary Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM1"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;), which meant that accessory chromosomes constitute a substantial part of the data filtered out.

Images were imported into R using the readImage function that extracts the intensity of each pixel of the red, green and blue channels. Pixels with red intensity above 0.7 were characteristic of cultures, whereas the background (culture medium) was below 0.7. Coordinates (that is, their position in the image) of pixels with red intensity above 0.7 were stored and used to calculate the minimum convex polygon (MCP) using the mcp function of the adehabitatHR package. The MCP was used to outline the edge of the fungal growth and to calculate the number of pixels it covered. To overcome potential issues with dark non-fungal material present on the plate (for example, droplets of water or dirt) that would be included in 100% MCPs and hence artificially increase culture size, we calculated 11 MCPs per isolate, excluding 5−15% of outliers in steps of 1 (11 values; that is, MCP 85 until 95%). We then extrapolated the number of pixels covered by the fungus (for example, for an isolate covering 180 pixels calculated with an MCP 90%: 180/90 × 100 = 200 pixels). For each MCP, pixels were finally transformed to square centimetres with the use of cross multiplication in relation to an object of known size (5.207681 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). For each isolate, the average across the 11 MCPs was used, and the quality of the estimates was evaluated using the standard deviation of the estimate made for the 11 MCPs and visual inspection of the edge of the MCPs depicted on top of the original picture. Resulting culture sizes are visualized in Extended Data Fig. &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="figure anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#Fig8"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; and Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec42"&gt;Analysis of culture darkness&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The colouration of culture medium as a result of culture growth was measured from the same pictures taken for the analysis of growth (see the section ‘Analysis of growth’; 45 isolates for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and 34 isolates for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2).

Colour images were transformed into black and white images, and the pixel density (a value from 0 to 1; 1 being white and 0 being black) was recorded in 3 rectangles distributed on the area showing the culture medium (that is, not touching the edge of the culture and also avoiding the centre with fungal growth). The median pixel density among the three rectangles was used as a proxy for culture darkness. For each isolate, the difference in pixel density between the picture taken after 1 week and that taken after 8 weeks was calculated (8 weeks – 1 week, resulting in a positive value if darkness increased, a negative value when darkness decreased).

For this analysis, closely related bat species that are challenging to identify during hibernation were pooled together. Furthermore, to improve model convergence and to ensure identifiability of the model, only the most commonly infected species, that is, species from which we isolated &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt; at ten or more sites were included in the model. This resulted in a dataset comprising 4,295 isolates from 231 sites in Europe, broken down as follows: &lt;i&gt;M.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;mystacinus&lt;/i&gt; (28 isolates, 10 sites); &lt;i&gt;M.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;dasycneme&lt;/i&gt; (107 isolates, 11 sites); &lt;i&gt;M.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;daubentonii&lt;/i&gt; (111 isolates, 17 sites); &lt;i&gt;Myotis&lt;/i&gt; species complex (322 isolates, 38 sites); and &lt;i&gt;M.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;myotis&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;blythii&lt;/i&gt; (3,727 isolates, 187 sites). We fit a Bayesian hierarchical model using clade identity as our response variable and a logit link function. Bat species, latitude and longitude were included as population-level effects (analogous to a fixed effect in a frequentist approach), whereas samples (nested within sites) and sites were included as group effect (analogous to a random effect in a frequentist approach) with random intercept. The group-level effects were used to account for variations between sites and between samples within site. Given that both &lt;i&gt;P.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;destructans&lt;/i&gt; clades were found in roughly equal numbers in &lt;i&gt;M.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;mystacinus&lt;/i&gt; (13 and 15 isolates for &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2, respectively), this bat species was used as the baseline category. To estimate the model parameters and to perform Bayesian inference, the model was fitted using 8 chains with 10,000 iterations each. To improve convergence, the ‘adapt_delta’ parameter, controlling the acceptance rate of the algorithm, was set to 0.99. The first 1,000 iterations of each chain were discarded as warm-up (burn-in) to ensure convergence. Chains were sampled using the NUTS (No-U-Turn Sampler) algorithm in Stan (&lt;a href="https://mc-stan.org/"&gt;https://mc-stan.org/&lt;/a&gt;) with the brms (v. 2.20.3)&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 124" title="Bürkner, P.-C. brms: an R package for Bayesian multilevel models using stan.

Using this approach, a set of isolates from the Czech Republic (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 3), Portugal (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 13) and South Korea (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 2) could be identified as belonging to clade &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 (Supplementary Table &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM5"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;), for example. These data combined with the data presented in the main text confirmed that &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 and &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 co-occur in Europe, but thus far, only &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-2 has been found in East Asia (one isolate from China, one from Mongolia, two from South Korea). This result suggests that &lt;i&gt;Pd&lt;/i&gt;-1 is rarer in East Asia or perhaps even absent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--divider" id="Sec46"&gt;Reporting summary&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further information on research design is available in the &lt;a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="supplementary material anchor" href="/articles/s41586-025-09060-5#MOESM2"&gt;Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary&lt;/a&gt; linked to this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 15:51:55 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE1kdEN2bEtqLTJYa2dYYU05c25vM2J6MkdQbWluVzVvLXhhME1hZUZpV1J1WG5tcE1oZGo5bU5EQjRWcWFYMkdzaXl3dzN5WGFMUGNRbVd0LUFPX0dtT0xj</guid></item><item><title>皮肤和脖子上有微妙的迹象，这意味着您可能会因100米而遭受致命疾病-每日邮报 | Subtle signs on your skin and neck that mean you could have deadly condition suffered by 100m - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unexplained changes in your skin can occur for a number of reasons - whether it's from time in the sun or allergies. However, a health coach warns they could be a sign of something more sinister. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jade Rivers, a wellness coach, recently revealed 'what a body looks like when it's heading toward [type 2] diabetes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the condition globally and over 37million American adults suffer from this form of the chronic illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is caused by &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-11238421/Even-SLIM-type-2-diabetics-reverse-condition.html"&gt;either the pancreas not producing enough insulin&lt;/a&gt; or the body's cells not responding properly to insulin. This leads to high blood sugar levels and a buildup of glucose in the bloodstream, which can damage the eyes, kidneys, nerves and heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is often linked to lifestyle factors like obesity, poor diet and lack of physical activity and because it develops gradually, people may not know they have it until serious complications arise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, according to Rivers, if people are able to recognize several changes in their bodies that indicate insulin resistance - a precursor to diabetes that plagues 100million people - they may be able to make changes and reverse it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Below, DailyMail.com details the unexpected signs you could be headed toward a type 2 diabetes diagnosis: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Dark patches on the neck and underarms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Insulin resistance can lead to the build of the hormone in the body, which can cause dark spots and rashes on the skin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dark, velvety patches on the skin, often in body folds like the neck and armpits, can be a sign of acanthosis nigricans (AN).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is a skin condition often associated with obesity and insulin resistance, and a possible early sign of type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The patches are not caused by diabetes itself, but rather by the underlying insulin resistance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;AN is characterized by dark, velvety patches in areas across the body like the neck, armpits, groin, and sometimes on the hands, elbows, or knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is typically a sign your body is making extra insulin. When the body is resistant to insulin, the pancreas may overproduce the hormone in order to compensate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This excess insulin then builds up and causes the dark patches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While it can cause embarrassment and some people may try to scrub or bleach the patches away, this is not effective in getting rid of the dark spots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, you should change your diet to include more healthy foods and get physical activity. Losing weight can also help. This will lower the amount of excess insulin in the body and can alleviate AN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox mol-style-bold mol-style-large"&gt;Skin tags&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Skin tags, also known as acrochordons, are small, harmless growths often found in areas where skin folds or rubs together, such as the neck, armpits and groin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They may also appear where skin rubs against clothing or jewelry and are caused by friction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While typically benign, if you begin noticing the appearance of more skin tags than is normal for you, a trip to the doctor may be in order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jade Rivers, a wellness expert, who noted that dark patches on the neck and underarms and a slight hump on at the neck are all signs that your body is heading towards Type 2 diabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In people with insulin resistance, skin tags form because insulin plays a role in regulating cell growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When someone is insulin resistant and the pancreas produces too much, it can stimulate the growth of skin cells, which in turn can lead to skin tags. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, insulin resistance can disrupt the balance of the hormone insulin-growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which is linked to skin tag formation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="health-ccox mol-style-bold mol-style-large"&gt;A hump or fat around your neck Neck&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A neck hump, sometimes called a buffalo hump, is a fat pad that forms at the base of the back of the neck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Being insulin resistant and struggling with a build up of insulin in the body leads to weight gain, fat accumulation and a struggle to lose weight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could cause fat deposits to collect in certain areas of the body, such as the neck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, the hormone imbalance caused by insulin resistance or full-blown diabetes contributes to abnormal fat distribution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like many other symptoms of insulin resistance, a hump or fat around the neck can be alleviated by diet and exercise changes, which can lead to healthy weight loss.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Male fertility rates have been plummeting &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/humupd/dmac035"&gt;over the past half-century&lt;/a&gt;. An analysis from 1992 noted a steady decrease in sperm counts and quality &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.305.6854.609"&gt;since the 1940s&lt;/a&gt;. A more recent study found that male infertility rates &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-023-16793-3"&gt;increased nearly 80% from 1990 to 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The reasons driving this trend remain a mystery, but frequently cited culprits include &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/mou.0000000000000745"&gt;obesity, poor diet and environmental toxins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fertility-academy.co.uk/blog/7-stis-that-affect-male-fertility/"&gt;Infectious diseases&lt;/a&gt; such as gonorrhea or chlamydia are often overlooked factors that affect fertility in men. Accumulating evidence suggests that a common single-celled parasite called &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/toxoplasmosis/about/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; may also be a contributor: An April 2025 study showed for the first time that “human sperm &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;lose their heads&lt;/a&gt; upon direct contact” with the parasite.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I am a microbiologist, and &lt;a href="https://medicine.iu.edu/faculty/13502/sullivan-william"&gt;my lab studies &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This new study bolsters emerging findings that underscore the importance of preventing this parasitic infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-many-ways-you-can-get-toxoplasmosis"&gt;The many ways you can get toxoplasmosis&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Infected cats defecate &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; eggs into the litter box, garden or other places in the environment where they can be &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1079/ahr2005100"&gt;picked up by humans or other animals&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/foods11162542"&gt;Water, shellfish and unwashed fruits and vegetables&lt;/a&gt; can also harbor infectious parasite eggs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to eggs, tissue cysts present in the meat of warm-blooded animals can spread toxoplasmosis as well if they are not destroyed by &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/people-risk-foodborne-illness/toxoplasma-food-safety-moms-be"&gt;cooking to proper temperature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While most hosts of the parasite can control the initial infection with few if any symptoms, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; remains in the body for life as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6976.2011.00305.x"&gt;dormant cysts in brain, heart and muscle tissue&lt;/a&gt;. These cysts can reactivate and cause additional episodes of severe illness that damage critical organ systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0090203"&gt;30% and 50% of the world’s population&lt;/a&gt; is permanently infected with &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; due to the many ways the parasite can spread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-toxoplasma-can-target-male-reproductive-organs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can target male reproductive organs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Upon infection, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; spreads to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/pim.12163"&gt;virtually every organ and skeletal muscle&lt;/a&gt;. Evidence that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can also target human male reproductive organs first surfaced &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3755328"&gt;during the height of the AIDS pandemic&lt;/a&gt; in the 1980s, when some patients presented with the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5812/jjm.7184"&gt;parasitic infection in their testes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ml-embedded" data-form="Vb1cN3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While immunocompromised patients are most at risk for testicular toxoplasmosis, it can also occur in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2018-224962"&gt;otherwise healthy individuals&lt;/a&gt;. Imaging studies of infected mice confirm that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; parasites &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1462-5822.2005.00517.x"&gt;quickly travel to the testes&lt;/a&gt; in addition to the brain and eyes within days of infection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2017, my colleagues and I found that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/pros.23362"&gt;form cysts in mouse prostates&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers have also observed these parasites in the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5812/jjm.7184"&gt;ejaculate of many animals&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2022.10.034"&gt;human semen&lt;/a&gt;, raising the possibility of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.109725"&gt;sexual transmission&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Knowing that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can reside in male reproductive organs has prompted analyses of fertility in infected men. A small 2021 study in Prague of 163 men infected with &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; found that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/andr.12969"&gt;over 86% had semen anomalies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A 2002 study in China found that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12479125/"&gt;infertile couples are more likely&lt;/a&gt; to have a &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; infection than fertile couples, 34.83% versus 12.11%. A 2005 study in China also found that &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16078665"&gt;sterile men are more likely to test positive&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; than fertile men.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26622295/"&gt;Not all studies&lt;/a&gt;, however, produce a link between toxoplasmosis and sperm quality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-toxoplasma-can-directly-damage-human-sperm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can directly damage human sperm&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Toxoplasmosis in animals mirrors infection in humans, which allows researchers to address questions that are not easy to examine in people.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Testicular function and sperm production are sharply diminished in &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;-infected &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0096770"&gt;mice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exppara.2023.108571"&gt;rats&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens9121004"&gt;rams&lt;/a&gt;. Infected mice have significantly lower sperm counts and a higher proportion of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107573"&gt;abnormally shaped sperm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In that April 2025 study, researchers from Germany, Uruguay and Chile observed that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can reach the testes &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/epididymis"&gt;and epididymis&lt;/a&gt;, the tube where sperm mature and are stored, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;two days after infection&lt;/a&gt; in mice. This finding prompted the team to test what happens when the parasite comes into direct contact with human sperm in a test tube.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After only five minutes of exposure to the parasite, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;22.4% of sperm cells were beheaded&lt;/a&gt;. The number of decapitated sperm increased the longer they interacted with the parasites. Sperm cells that maintained their head were often &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.70097"&gt;twisted and misshapen&lt;/a&gt;. Some sperm cells had holes in their head, suggesting the parasites were trying to invade them as it would any other type of cell in the organs it infiltrates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to direct contact, &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; may also damage sperm because the infection promotes &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/pros.23362"&gt;chronic inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. Inflammatory conditions in the male reproductive tract are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26913230/"&gt;harmful to sperm production and function&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers speculate that the harmful effects &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; may have on sperm could be contributing to large global declines in male fertility over the past decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-preventing-toxoplasmosis"&gt;Preventing toxoplasmosis&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The evidence that &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; can infiltrate male reproductive organs in animals is compelling, but whether this produces health issues in people remains unclear. Testicular toxoplasmosis shows that parasites can invade human testes, but &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2025.116709"&gt;symptomatic disease is very rare&lt;/a&gt;. Studies to date that show defects in the sperm of infected men are too small to draw firm conclusions at this time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, some reports suggest that rates of toxoplasmosis in high-income countries &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pt.2022.10.003"&gt;have not been increasing&lt;/a&gt; over the past few decades while male infertility was rising, so it’s likely to only be one part of the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regardless of this parasite’s potential effect on fertility, it is wise to avoid &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;. An infection can cause miscarriage or birth defects if someone acquires it for the first time during pregnancy, and it can be life-threatening for immunocompromised people. &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt; is also the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/toxoplasmosis/about/index.html"&gt;leading cause of death from foodborne illness&lt;/a&gt; in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taking &lt;a href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/23408"&gt;proper care of your cat&lt;/a&gt;, promptly cleaning the litter box and thoroughly washing your hands after can help reduce your exposure to &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma&lt;/em&gt;. You can also protect yourself from this parasite by washing fruits and vegetables, &lt;a href="https://www.foodsafety.gov/food-safety-charts/safe-minimum-internal-temperatures"&gt;cooking meat to proper temperatures&lt;/a&gt; before consuming and avoiding &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/605433"&gt;raw shellfish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-does-raw-water-compare-to-tap-water-a-microbiologist-explains-why-the-risks-outweigh-the-benefits-246866"&gt;raw water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.1982.03330140038029"&gt;raw milk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan is the first country to begin clinical trials of artificial blood, a medical innovation which if proven successful, would solve one of the largest hospital challenges of our age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning back in March, a clinical trial &lt;a href="https://mededgemea.com/japan-to-begin-clinical-trials-for-artificial-blood-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;organized&lt;/a&gt; by Nara Medical University will look to build on the success of an early-stage trial in 2022 of hemoglobin vesicles, small artificial blood cells that were confirmed to be safe and capable of delivering oxygen as normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial will administer 100 to 400 milliliters of the artificial blood cells to further test safety before moving onto broader performance and efficacy targets, all in the hopes that by 2030, the artificial blood could enter clinical use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether high-income or low-income, every country has challenges meeting the necessity necessary amounts of stockpiled blood donations for emergency medical procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In high-income countries where the 90% of blood stockpiles comes from voluntary donors, the challenge is getting enough of these donations, and crucially, enough from those with rare blood types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In low-income countries where only 40% of needs are met with donations, the challenge lies in importation from abroad when donated blood packs are only safe for use for a few months. A useful proxy to understanding this shortfall is that of 175 countries included in a survey of blood donation and use practices by the World Health Organization, 106 countries report that all blood plasma-derived products are imported. These include things like immunoglobulins and coagulation factors which are needed to prevent and treat a variety of serious conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan has a different challenge. The WHO &lt;a href="https://aho.org/fact-sheets/blood-safety-and-availability-factsheet/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that the use of donated blood varied with income levels, reporting that high-income countries used more blood donations to treat those aged 65 and older, while lower-income countries used it to treat those aged 5 and under.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE HORIZON OF MEDICAL RESEARCH: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="NIH Funding Now Will Prioritize Research That Eschews Animal Testing to Push Innovation" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/nih-funding-now-to-prioritize-research-that-eschews-animal-testing-for-better-ethics-and-efficacy/" rel="bookmark"&gt;NIH Funding Now Will Prioritize Research That Eschews Animal Testing to Push Innovation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan has recognized that its long-since-collapsed replacement birth rate coupled with long life-expectancy will place a likely unsustainable burden of blood donation on a shrinking working-age population, making artificial blood a priority innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Hiromi Sakai at Nara Medical University has pioneered one method for its synthesis. Using hemoglobin—the oxygen carrying molecule inside red blood cells—from expired donations and encasing them in protective shells, removing the need of matching blood type for administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE MEDICAL ADVANCEMENTS: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Cure for Pre-Eclampsia is On Horizon as Researcher Discovers Lipid Nanoparticle to Deliver Directly to Placenta" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/cure-for-pre-eclampsia-is-on-horizon-as-researcher-discovers-lipid-nanoparticle-to-deliver-directly-to-placenta/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Cure for Pre-Eclampsia is On Horizon as Researcher Discovers Lipid Nanoparticle to Deliver Directly to Placenta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another method comes from Chuo University where the hemoglobin is encased in an albumin-family protein, which &lt;a href="https://www.chuo-u.ac.jp/english/news/2023/07/67032/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;has been used in animal studies&lt;/a&gt; to stabilize blood pressure and treat conditions like hemorrhage and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, the necessity is there and it’s urgent for Japan and the world. If the country’s researchers succeed in this innovation, it will be a medical milestone of epic proportions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHARE This Encouraging Clinical Development On Route From Japan…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In some cases, it's all they'll eat, even if it means chomping down on some &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/entertainment/netflix/liver-king-netflix-documentary-wife-diet-testicles-371631-20250513"&gt;bulls' testicles&lt;/a&gt; to make sure your protein is of the highest possible percentage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Which is obviously a completely sane thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;One of the easiest and quickest sources of protein these days seemingly comes from little bars, which are seen as a great snack if you're out running, and it certainly makes more sense than bringing an entire chicken breast with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It's difficult to argue with that concept, especially if you're doing exercise, as the protein can be a great way to help your muscles recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Protein bars have long been thought to be good for athletes (Getty Stock)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, experts recently &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/are-protein-bars-good-for-you-muscle-growth-256878-20250526"&gt;delivered a warning&lt;/a&gt; to anyone who eats them regularly, as a study found that lots of them can be ultra-processed and perhaps don't contain as much protein as we are led to believe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The study reveals the most commonly used protein source inside the bars, saying: "The most frequently used protein source was soy protein (isolate) with the relevance of 22 per cent, followed by peanuts (13 per cent) and WPI (whey protein isolate, 11 per cent). The remaining 12 per cent of all primary protein sources were distributed into two larger categories; (i) present in above one per cent of all protein bars, such as oats, milk-based proteins (whey protein hydrolysates and calcium caseinate) and cashews present in under one per cent of all protein bars, some oily seeds (e.g., pumpkin, sunflower, hemp), beef-based proteins (beef and collagen) and special protein sources."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It is also suggested that the other ingredients, which are added to the bars, namely things like chocolate, nuts and wafer, obviously make the protein bar a bit tastier, but they are also having a detrimental effect on the digestibility of the protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Maybe it's all just a placebo (Getty Stock)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Researchers stated: "These additional components all affect the digestibility of proteins and accessibility of amino acids therefore could considerably change their protein nutritional quality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;The researchers studied 1,641 bars in total and classified 18 bars (one per cent) as 'not protein source', 295 bars (18 per cent) as a 'protein source' 1,328 bars (81 per cent) as 'high in protein'. according to EU labelling criteria on protein related claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Study authors add: "The results show that lower protein digestibility values (between 47 and 81 per cent) were measured when the proteins were included as a component of the protein bar matrix than when the digestibility of the same proteins was evaluated in a pure format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Although most protein bars are labelled ‘high in protein’, their protein nutritional quality could be very low based on Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score (DIAAS). The low numbers are most probably due to application of lower-nutritional-quality proteins (such as collagen) and of other ingredients such as carbohydrates, fats and fibres, that might deteriorate the bio-accessibility of essential amino acids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;So, to sum that up for you, protein bars that claim to be high in protein may actually not have much protein in them at all, and if they do, it could be ultra processed food items, which the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; will tell you aren't particularly good for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 15:24:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxPUG5obUpnMWl3eE9PR3VRc1U1Y241TWFYTXV5S2xtdkZLTXBqaGJxOUpqSWZ4WU5yb2NIVW9hZVlLcEJZcGthQ1AtYUNYcC1ObjlkdS1LOGt5NnI5VUlMeG1xRndQSWFEaEc4QUNaOWlHSE11VjgyeExSc1gwWkJDQTJVd2Jhdk1CMEc4U3J5SFdfdHEwUEpOS2NwcUlBbXM</guid></item><item><title>你的道德指南针与你如何与你的身体和谐相处有关，学习提示- Live Science | Your moral compass is tied to how in tune you are with your body, study hints - Live Science</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxQdnRxTkdyZF90WWJGMDNRMzI4UHVwc2tDLUs0OHowLW4zSmp6c0xNVUtleHJHOE1JYi1TTTBsR0N1WVZyMTU0WjV3eGhPN201Z3BRZDFURElERFhQeWowUVZOTUZVZHFyMGdoY3NJd3BKZ194c3Q5QTZ0VS1tN2tDcXpYM2d3VU12YndueWV1TmFZc1VncTFTQjdWbS1QOUZyY3ZDR19HRmhodWVqbUdYWllhSThvY3hzeFRJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When wrestling with a moral dilemma, a person may reach a decision not only by thinking through the problem but also by tuning into physical signals from their body, a new study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research found that people who are more in tune with their body signals — such as shifts in their heart rate — tend to make moral decisions that align with the judgments that most other people would make if presented the same scenario. These findings suggest that such internal, physical cues could thus play a role in guiding a person's moral intuition, the study authors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Morality is often viewed as a product of culture and context," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/news/global_outlook/research_highlights/rh_01_202107" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/news/global_outlook/research_highlights/rh_01_202107" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tamami Nakano&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Osaka who was not involved in the study, told Live Science in an email. "Showing that bodily signals actively mediate this calibration is both novel and compelling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the study supports the idea that these bodily reactions form part of a feedback loop that helps guide people in their decision making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8645214/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8645214/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;previous studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have suggested that siding with the majority in a moral dilemma could help take some strain off the brain, and the new study seems to align with that notion, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Recent theories suggest that our brains are designed to minimize physical resource consumption while maintaining survival," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://socialdecisionneurosciencelab.org/people" target="_blank" data-url="https://socialdecisionneurosciencelab.org/people" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hackjin Kim&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neuroscientist at Korea University, told Live Science in an email. "One way to do this [conserve energy] is to learn others' expectations to avoid social conflict," Kim suggested. Combining these ideas, Kim and colleagues proposed that people who are better attuned to their bodily feedback signals may use that information to keep their decision-making in line with others' expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/human-behavior/people-really-can-communicate-with-just-their-eyes-study-finds" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/human-behavior/people-really-can-communicate-with-just-their-eyes-study-finds"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People really can communicate with just their eyes, study finds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-TYjrsyrCtyuBdRvPhimvpc" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-TYjrsyrCtyuBdRvPhimvpc slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their new study, published May 5 in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2025/04/28/JNEUROSCI.1114-24.2025" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2025/04/28/JNEUROSCI.1114-24.2025" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the team tested this hypothesis by presenting participants with moral dilemmas and asking them to choose between two decisions — one "utilitarian," which prioritized minimizing harm for the most people, and one "deontological," which prioritized following established rules and norms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate test, the researchers asked the participants to focus on their bodies and count their heartbeats over a short interval while the participants' heartbeats were simultaneously recorded with an electrocardiogram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who were more accurate at counting their heartbeats also tended to choose the moral decision that most other people chose, the team found. This was true whether more people chose the utilitarian or deontological option for a given moral dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be that cues from a person's body help signal when the person is about to do something that could run up against social norms — a scenario that requires more energy and effort to navigate, the study authors propose. Basically, it's easier to go with the flow than run against the grain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The idea is that feeling that anxiety is going to make you notice that you did something to cause that anxiety, and then make you try to avoid doing those things in the future," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/jordan-theriault/" target="_blank" data-url="https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/jordan-theriault/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jordan Theriault&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a psychologist and biologist at Northeastern University who was not involved in the study. "You feel that feedback from your body, and then you learn not to do that again in the future," he told Live Science. As Theriault describes, you learn over time what others expect of you morally, and your physical reactions form part of the feedback loop that helps guide future decision making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, participants responded to each dilemma without knowing which of the two options other people chose. They weren't pressured into making a certain decision or conforming to what the rest of the group unknowingly agreed upon, so the results reflect each individuals' moral intuition. Notably, all 104 participants were Korean university students, so it's possible they shared similar cultural and demographic backgrounds as well as similar moral norms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also studied people's brains while at rest to determine how much time they spent in different "brain states" — patterns of brain activity associated with different kinds of tasks. The brain switches back and forth between many different states even when a person isn't doing anything specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To track these states, the team used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which tracks blood flow as an indirect measure of brain activity. The researchers found that the people who were more aware of their body's signals tended to spend more time in a brain state associated with evaluation and judgment. This particular state was marked by activity in a brain region called the medial prefrontal cortex, which has previously been linked to the process of adjusting choices to meet other people's expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/how-much-of-your-brain-do-you-need-to-survive" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/neuroscience/how-much-of-your-brain-do-you-need-to-survive"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much of your brain do you need to survive?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These brain scans may further support the idea that people who are more in tune with their bodily signals use those cues to stay aligned with majority opinion. However, because these data were collected separately from the moral-decision tasks, "we still need task-based evidence showing which specific brain regions process body-related signals when people face real moral dilemmas and how these signals influence behavior in real time," Nakano told Live Science. This might involve having people contend with moral dilemmas while in an fMRI scanner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In future work, Kim plans to investigate how the relationship between moral intuition and awareness of body signals varies among cultures, types of moral dilemmas and individual personality differences. But for now, Kim said, "this research lays a new theoretical framework for understanding cultural and individual differences in moral behavior and predicting norm-following behavior in group or online settings."&lt;/p&gt;

As they surveyed colonies of hibernating bats, they discovered heaps of dead animals on the floors of caves and abandoned mines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The culprit was a fungus new to science. It caused white-nose disease, named for the fuzzy pale tendrils that sprouted from the nostrils of its victims. (The disease was originally known as white-nose syndrome, but was renamed in recent years.) The fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, or P. destructans, has &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.whitenosesyndrome.org/where-is-wns" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;spread&lt;/a&gt; from New York to 40 states and nine Canadian provinces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“This is the most dramatic wildlife mortality event that’s ever been documented from a pathogen,” said DeeAnn Reeder, a disease ecologist at Bucknell University. “Millions and millions and millions of animals have died.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In recent years, bat experts have gained some &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/17/science/bats-white-nose-syndrome.html" title=""&gt;guarded optimism&lt;/a&gt;.

              &lt;p&gt;As we enter the colder months in Australia, covid is &lt;a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/public-health/covid-19-new-subvariant-nb181-driving-increase-in-infections-in-wa-c-18801659"&gt;making headlines&lt;/a&gt; again, this time due to the emergence of a new variant: NB.1.8.1.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Last week, the &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; designated NB.1.8.1 as a “&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants"&gt;variant under monitoring&lt;/a&gt;”, owing to its growing global spread and some notable characteristics which could set it apart from earlier variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So what do you need to know about this new variant?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;The current covid situation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than five years since covid was initially declared a pandemic, we’re still experiencing regular waves of infections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s more difficult to track the occurrence of the virus nowadays, as fewer people are testing and reporting infections. But &lt;a href="https://www.immunisationcoalition.org.au/news-data/covid-statistics/"&gt;available data&lt;/a&gt; suggests in late May 2025, case numbers in Australia were &lt;a href="https://www.immunisationcoalition.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MAIN-Aust-COVID-19-Stats-worksheet-2025.xlsx-18.pdf"&gt;ticking upwards&lt;/a&gt;. Genomic sequencing has confirmed NB.1.8.1 is &lt;a href="https://mike-honey.github.io/covid-19-genomes/output/Coronavirus%20-%20Genomic%20Sequencing%20-%20report%20Australia.pdf"&gt;among the circulating strains&lt;/a&gt; in Australia, and &lt;a href="https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/covid-19/Documents/respiratory-surveillance-20250517.pdf"&gt;generally increasing&lt;/a&gt;. Of cases sequenced &lt;a href="https://mike-honey.github.io/covid-19-genomes/output/Coronavirus%20-%20Genomic%20Sequencing%20-%20report%20Australia.pdf"&gt;up to May 6&lt;/a&gt; across Australia, NB.1.8.1 ranged from less than 10% in South Australia to more than 40% in Victoria. Wastewater surveillance in Western Australia &lt;a href="https://www.health.wa.gov.au/articles/a_e/coronavirus/covid19-wastewater-surveillance"&gt;has determined NB.1.8.1&lt;/a&gt; is now the dominant variant in wastewater samples &lt;a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/public-health/covid-19-new-subvariant-nb181-driving-increase-in-infections-in-wa-c-18801659"&gt;collected in Perth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Internationally NB.1.8.1 is also growing. By &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;late April 2025&lt;/a&gt;, it comprised roughly 10.7% of all submitted sequences—up from just 2.5% four weeks prior. While the absolute number of cases sequenced was still modest, this consistent upward trend has prompted closer monitoring by international public health agencies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;NB.1.8.1 has been spreading particularly in Asia—it was the dominant variant in &lt;a href="https://github.com/neherlab/SARS-CoV-2_variant-reports/blob/main/reports/variant_report_latest_draft.md"&gt;Hong Kong and China&lt;/a&gt; at the end of April.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="align-right zoomable"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Where does this variant come from?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the WHO, NB.1.8.1 was first detected from samples &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;collected in January 2025&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a sublineage of the Omicron variant, descending from the recombinant XDV lineage. “&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/is-a-hybrid-covid-strain-behind-vietnams-latest-wave-not-exactly-161879"&gt;Recombinant&lt;/a&gt;” is where a new variant arises from the genetic mixing of two or more existing variants.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;What does the research say?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like its predecessors, NB.1.8.1 carries &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;a suite of mutations&lt;/a&gt; in the spike protein. This is the protein on the surface of the virus that allows it to infect us—specifically via the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-ace2-receptor-how-is-it-connected-to-coronavirus-and-why-might-it-be-key-to-treating-covid-19-the-experts-explain-136928"&gt;ACE2 receptors&lt;/a&gt;, a “doorway” to our cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;mutations include&lt;/a&gt; T22N, F59S, G184S, A435S, V445H, and T478I. It’s early days for this variant, so we don’t have much data on what these changes mean yet. But a &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.30.651462v1"&gt;recent preprint&lt;/a&gt; (a study that has not yet been peer reviewed) offers some clues about why NB.1.8.1 may be gathering traction.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Using lab-based models, researchers found NB.1.8.1 had the strongest binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor of several variants tested—suggesting it may infect cells more efficiently than earlier strains. The study also looked at how well antibodies from vaccinated or previously infected people could neutralise or “block” the variant. Results showed the neutralising response of antibodies was around 1.5 times lower to NB.1.8.1 compared to another recent variant, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/a-new-covid-variant-is-on-the-rise-heres-what-to-know-about-lp-8-1-253237"&gt;LP.8.1.1&lt;/a&gt;. This means it’s possible a person infected with NB.1.8.1 may be more likely to pass the virus on to someone else, compared to earlier variants.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The evidence so far suggests NB.1.8.1 may spread more easily and may partially sidestep immunity from prior infections or vaccination. These factors could explain its rise in sequencing data.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;But importantly, the WHO has not yet observed any evidence it causes &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;more severe disease&lt;/a&gt; compared to other variants. Reports suggest &lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/new-covid-variant-nb-1-8-1-behind-surge-in-cases-recently-symptoms-associated-with-it/photostory/121373694.cms"&gt;symptoms of NB.1.8.1&lt;/a&gt; should align closely with other Omicron subvariants. Common symptoms include sore throat, fatigue, fever, mild cough, muscle aches, and nasal congestion. Gastrointestinal symptoms may also occur in some cases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How about the vaccine?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There’s potential for this variant to play a significant role in Australia’s winter respiratory season. Public health responses remain focused on close monitoring, continued genomic sequencing, and promoting the uptake of updated covid boosters.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Even if neutralising antibody levels &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.30.651462v1"&gt;are modestly reduced&lt;/a&gt; against NB.1.8.1, the WHO has noted current covid vaccines should still &lt;a href="https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/documents/epp/tracking-sars-cov-2/23052025_nb.1.8.1_ire.pdf"&gt;protect against severe disease&lt;/a&gt; with this variant.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The most recent booster available in Australia and many other countries &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/new-covid-vaccines-may-be-coming-to-australia-heres-what-to-know-about-the-jn-1-shots-237652"&gt;targets JN.1&lt;/a&gt;, from which NB.1.8.1 is descended. So it makes sense it should still offer good protection.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ahead of winter and with a new variant on the scene, now may be a good time to consider another covid booster &lt;a href="https://www.health.gov.au/our-work/covid-19-vaccines/getting-your-vaccination"&gt;if you’re eligible&lt;/a&gt;. For some people, particularly those who are medically vulnerable, covid can still be a serious disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/lara-herrero-1166059"&gt;Lara Herrero&lt;/a&gt;, Associate Professor and Research Leader in Virology and Infectious Disease, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/griffith-university-828"&gt;Griffith University&lt;/a&gt;.

Conducted by TPE provider &lt;a href="https://www.circulate.health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Circulate Health&lt;/a&gt; in collaboration with the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, the single-blind human trial is believed to be the first to assess the rejuvenative potential of TPE using comprehensive molecular profiling. Participants who underwent biweekly TPE with IVIG demonstrated an average reduction in biological age of 2.61 years, outperforming the 1.32-year reduction observed in those receiving TPE alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Backed by Khosla Ventures, Circulate is building on &lt;a href="https://longevity.technology/news/be-part-of-bringing-plasmapheresis-to-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;research led by Dr Dobri Kiprov&lt;/a&gt;, a pioneer in therapeutic plasma exchange for aging. The company is led by co-founders Dr Brad Younggren and Dr Eric Verdin, who is also president and CEO of the Buck Institute, and its FDA-cleared TPE system is already used in more than 20 functional health clinics across the US.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In this study, we examined thousands of molecular signatures to pinpoint key drivers of rejuvenation,” said Verdin. “Our characterization builds a better understanding of which baseline biomarkers are predictive of treatment response and lays a foundation upon which we can build personalized intervention plans for patients in the future.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Longevity.Technology: TPE, also known as plasmapheresis, involves circulating a patient’s blood through an apheresis machine that separates and removes plasma before replacing it with a substitute such as albumin or donor plasma. This process is designed to eliminate disease-promoting substances like autoantibodies, inflammatory proteins or toxins, many of which accumulate with age and contribute to age-related conditions. Already well-established in the treatment of several autoimmune and neurological disorders, TPE is now being explored for its applications in aging and longevity science. To learn more, we sat down with Dr Matt Kaeberlein, CEO of &lt;a href="https://longevity.technology/news/we-want-to-help-people-add-10-20-years-of-healthspan/"&gt;Optispan&lt;/a&gt; and affiliate professor at the University of Washington, who recently joined Circulate’s Scientific Advisory Board.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A renowned aging researcher himself, Kaeberlein says his decision to get involved in Circulate was driven by the company’s scientific credibility and a growing personal conviction about the promise of the technology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" nitro-lazy-src="https://cdn-ilclkjd.nitrocdn.com/gGMFLmxRxYtlfrobExXMvPeqSnTPOgve/assets/images/optimized/rev-66d6e4e/longevity.technology/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/matt-kaeberlein-headshot-1024x683.jpg" class="wp-image-60084 nitro-lazy" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty id="NDQzODoyMzY=-1" src=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Matt Kaeberlein is the latest addition to Circulate Health’s Scientific Advisory Board.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The fact that Eric Verdin from the Buck Institute is a co-founder, and David Furman is involved gives me a lot of confidence that this is being approached from a scientifically rigorous perspective,” he says. “Eric and David are fantastic scientists – I have a ton of respect for them – and the fact that they’re doing these kinds of studies bears that out. So I have confidence that the company really is trying to do this in the right way.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kaeberlein ‘bullish’ on TPE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Beyond the people involved, the growing body of scientific evidence supporting TPE’s potential also played a role in Kaeberlein’s decision.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Over the last 12 to 18 months, I personally have become much more bullish on the technology of therapeutic plasma exchange,” he says. “This comes in part from the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-024-00166-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;preclinical literature&lt;/a&gt; in laboratory animals showing that you can both increase lifespan and improve function in a variety of aged tissues and organs, and then the small but growing data from human studies and small clinical trials.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The recent trial studied 42 participants aged over 50 to explore how different TPE regimens affected biological aging markers across the epigenome, proteome, metabolome, glycome, and immune system. Physical function measures such as balance and strength were also included.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The study was primarily a safety evaluation, but also with the goal of looking at whether TPE can have effects on biological age clocks based on multi-omic types of data,” explains Kaeberlein. “I thought it was interesting that they tested both with and without intravenous immunoglobulin, and also the fact that they looked at multiple types of omics data instead of just using epigenetic clocks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="longe-caa9a2d998cc82f82096bad2d201a948 longe-content-middle" id="longe-caa9a2d998cc82f82096bad2d201a948"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TPE reduced biological age in all groups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study found that, among all treatment groups, TPE led to measurable reductions in biological age, with the most pronounced effects seen in the group receiving both TPE and IVIG. The combined treatment also restored immune cell profiles typically altered with age, modulated proteins associated with cellular senescence, and appeared to improve immune resilience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" nitro-lazy-src="https://cdn-ilclkjd.nitrocdn.com/gGMFLmxRxYtlfrobExXMvPeqSnTPOgve/assets/images/optimized/rev-66d6e4e/longevity.technology/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Circulate-Health-plasma-in-a-tube-1024x683.jpg" class="wp-image-60083 nitro-lazy" decoding="async" nitro-lazy-empty id="NDQ3NDoyNDU=-1" src=""&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;A close-up on plasma running through Circulate’s TPE system. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;“There was evidence for improvements in a variety of these multi-omic biological age estimates – all consistent with the idea that therapeutic plasma exchange is moving biomarkers of health in the right direction,” says Kaeberlein. “And there was a trend that the IVIG added some value.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study found that individuals in poorer baseline health experienced the most significant benefits. Participants with elevated bilirubin, glucose, or liver enzyme levels saw larger decreases in biological age and improvements in their health markers. Even among healthier participants, the treatment yielded gains in physical performance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin are a powerful tool for biological age rejuvenation and provide compelling evidence that targeted plasma interventions can impact age-related molecular changes,” said Circulate CEO Younggren in a statement.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the data also indicated that the most substantial benefits occurred after the initial three treatment sessions, with subsequent rounds offering diminished returns. The researchers believe the pattern suggests future protocols might improve outcomes by adjusting treatment frequency or combining TPE with complementary therapies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;inflammation and neurodegeneration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Kaeberlein was also careful to note the study’s limitations, including the small size of the cohorts, a point also noted by the study’s authors, who intend to expand the research to “larger populations.” And, while he says more research is needed to determine effect size, he adds that “the limited data that I’ve seen is suggestive that, at least in those populations who are likely to be strong responders, the effect size is significant.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it comes to the long-term potential of TPE, Kaeberlein is clearly optimistic, particularly in areas like chronic inflammation and neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m pretty bullish on the likelihood that some sort of therapeutic plasma exchange – perhaps in combination with IVIG, or even in combination with delivering other factors as part of the TPE – is likely to have health benefits, at least for a subset of people,” he says. “The people who are the most obvious candidates are those with high levels of chronic, sterile inflammation, or people who are either at high risk for dementia or who are already on that path with mild cognitive impairment.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, so convinced is Kaeberlein, that he is about to see for himself what TPE can deliver.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’m actually going to be doing my first round of therapeutic plasma exchange on Wednesday of this week, and will be doing some biomarker comparisons before and after,” he says. “As someone who tends to be pretty conservative relative to some other people in this field about endorsing interventions, I would say I’m cautiously optimistic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="longe-64daebdcb906a59836eccd0c23228e72 longe-content-bottom" id="longe-64daebdcb906a59836eccd0c23228e72"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h6 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photographs courtesy of Circulate Health.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h6&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Longevity.Technology</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2025 14:35:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxQMVVXR1ZjV0d6djk5Zmxla3VmVDVCdzBSNG5ubWdCdlNRcE5tZE9ITDl0WlNRV1VSZ0xkcVZNS0tBRDlnMGx1T3pQeHRyR0lwSDJEbXhhS2thMVZmbmZKa0RxZC1aS3VIcFRzQ0lHZXFkRDBGNU1sUGRTTTcwUTBqZ0J6d1VKSW13ZDJpVHhtZDVUdmJHeFN5ZTFWRFRtRU11bEtyVnEzbGNhcjTSAasBQVVfeXFMUDFVV0dWY1dHenY5OWZsZWt1ZlQ1QncwUjRubm1nQnZTUXBObWRPSEw5dFpTUVdVUmdMZHFWTUtLQUQ5ZzBsdU96UHh0ckdJcEgyRG14YUtrYTFWZm5mSmtEcWQtWkt1SHBUc0NJR2VxZEQwRjVNbFBkU003MFEwamdCendVSkltd2QyaVR4bWQ1VHZiR3hTeWUxVkRUbUVNdWxLclZxM2xjYXI0</guid></item></channel></rss>
