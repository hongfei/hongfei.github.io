In a sudden stop, the body continues moving forward with the car's momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If feet are on the dashboard, this can force the legs into a position that causes severe &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-7924629/Womans-hips-crushed-crash-propped-feet-dashboard.html"&gt;injuries like hip breaks&lt;/a&gt;, bone fractures and joint dislocations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, airbags deploy with tremendous force during a collision. If a passenger's feet are on the dashboard, the airbag can impact the legs with enough power to cause fractures, dislocations, and other severe injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The seat belt is the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14430187/Doctors-dangers-not-wearing-seatbelt.html"&gt;primary defense in a crash&lt;/a&gt;, but this safety measure is compromised when feet are on the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In this position, the seat belt cannot properly restrain the passenger, increasing the risk of being thrown forward. This can lead to severe head injuries, broken bones or even ejection from the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Feet on the dashboard also impedes a passenger's reaction time, preventing them from bracing quickly for sudden stops or obstacles and endangering all occupants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Feet on the dashboard prevents the seatbelt from properly restraining a passenger, dramatically increasing the risk of severe injury or ejection in a crash&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Solomon Behar, a pediatric emergency medicine physician at Miller Children’s &amp;amp; Women’s Hospital in Long Beach, California, told &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.aol.com/articles/er-docs-want-people-stop-145000250.html"&gt;Parade &lt;/a&gt;magazine: ‘I do a lot of driving on Los Angeles freeways, and one of the things that makes me cringe is when I pass a passenger who has their feet up on the dashboard.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Placing feet on the dashboard fundamentally alters the passenger's posture and, consequently, the function of the seatbelt, creating a cascade of failure points in the event of a collision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Behar added: ‘[Sitting upright with feed on the floor is safest because] it allows the seat belt and airbag systems to function as they were supposed to, distributing the forces more evenly and actually reducing the risk of drying your legs and pelvis.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During a frontal collision, the body will pivot at the waist and slide underneath the lap belt, which allows the lower body to thrust forward while the upper body is unrestrained, dramatically increasing the risk of severe internal abdominal injuries and spinal damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the car stops or slams into another vehicle in front, the head, torso and lower body are all thrown forward with the car’s momentum, but the locked seatbelt restrains the torso. Meanwhile, the lower body continues to move forward violently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The knees, already pressed against the dashboard, become a pivot point while the dashboard stops the lower legs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The thigh bones are the long, strong levers that concentrate immense force on the hips and knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can lead to a fracture of the socket of the hip joint in the pelvis, which endangers the entire structure of the hip and often requires extensive reconstructive surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;Based on 2019-2020 data, the most recent data published by the CDC, the rate of emergency department visits for car crashes varied significantly by age, averaging 11.6 visits per 1,000 people annually. The rate peaked at 19.1 for young adults aged 15-24&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The long thigh bone can snap near the hip or just above the knee from the bending stress and the kneecap can be shattered as it is crushed between the femur and the dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jacob Snow, a pediatric emergency room specialist at Pediatrix Medical Group in Las Vegas, Nevada, said: ‘Cars are designed to protect passengers seated with their feet on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘It prevents the risk of your legs buckling or being pushed back into your face by the dash itself or the airbags. Additionally, many cars have special airbags designed to protect your legs.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An airbag deploys at speeds between 100 and 220 MPH. If a passenger's feet are on the dashboard at the moment of deployment, the explosive force can drive their knees backward with enough violence to cause severe facial and head trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Snow added: ‘There is always some risk of being involved in a car accident every time you ride or drive. Riding with your feet on the dash adds unnecessary risk.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 16:18:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOcVFnMWJHUHpSS24xY0tJdVFLX3dWbGdSYV9Sc0dWczFMMnhMTWhQbnY2X1lYYmp2a2pFdUZoQWJUNEZobUxBMzJSMUlKanNtcXo3X09Fd0pIWVZNRkFnOUwxV2k0Sm1BQmxTT2ZPbXViUWU1Q2NsSW01a004bzhIWmNyc1dJbllwYlBYUDY5bmJtbTRCb3Y0anZGSkVnaHEyaWUxc2xPYVJfd9IBrwFBVV95cUxQa2tfb3ljcjE5NG5nR0pWRE91eC1lODJuMER1c2xUOGdYd2xmV3BBMWNJc01aeGhab3RaUTJvbWcyOWdta1ROUmF1WURCMjhlSFhzNXB5RnZXRjB4ZGtJRllNRFlLekZtRzNRNDgweDJsLTMzMzRlQ2N3eXB5MFFVS2ZlMGNTM3dOTUs2cHVIb1JWZEV1WmVKaWNtUjM5M2xDU09OMmZFTFBkVzlqMFlF</guid></item><item><title>富含维生素k可以帮助大脑自我修复- ScienceDaily</title><link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/10/251014014312.htm</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p id="first" class="lead"&gt;Neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease occur when neurons gradually deteriorate and die. This progressive loss of brain cells leads to severe symptoms including memory decline, cognitive impairment, and difficulty with movement. Over time, these conditions can greatly diminish quality of life and often leave patients dependent on continuous care. Current medications can help ease symptoms but do not stop or reverse the underlying disease, highlighting the urgent need for new therapeutic approaches. One promising strategy focuses on stimulating neuronal differentiation, the process of forming new neurons that could replace those lost and potentially slow or counteract neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin K, a fat-soluble nutrient best known for its role in blood clotting and bone health, has recently attracted attention for its influence on brain cell development and protection. However, naturally occurring vitamin K forms such as menaquinone 4 (MK-4) may not be potent enough for effective use in regenerative therapies targeting neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking study published in &lt;em&gt;ACS Chemical Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, researchers from the Department of Bioscience and Engineering at Shibaura Institute of Technology in Japan, led by Associate Professor Yoshihisa Hirota and Professor Yoshitomo Suhara, created and tested new vitamin K analogues with stronger neuroactive effects. The team also identified a distinct mechanism through which vitamin K promotes neuronal differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explaining their findings, Dr. Hirota noted, "The newly synthesized vitamin K analogues demonstrated approximately threefold greater potency in inducing the differentiation of neural progenitor cells into neurons compared to natural vitamin K. Since neuronal loss is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, these analogues may serve as regenerative agents that help replenish lost neurons and restore brain function."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To boost vitamin K's biological impact, the team produced 12 hybrid vitamin K homologs by linking them with retinoic acid (an active metabolite of vitamin A that encourages neuronal differentiation), a carboxylic acid group, or a methyl ester side chain. They then evaluated how effectively each compound promoted neuronal differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin K and retinoic acid influence gene transcription through the steroid and xenobiotic receptor (SXR) and retinoic acid receptor (RAR), respectively. The researchers measured SXR and RAR activity in mouse neural progenitor cells treated with the newly developed compounds and found that the hybrids maintained the biological functions of both parent molecules. They also measured the expression of microtubule-associated protein 2 (Map2), a neuronal growth marker, to track cell differentiation. One compound, which combined retinoic acid with a methyl ester side chain, produced a threefold increase in neuronal differentiation compared with the control and showed significantly stronger activity than natural vitamin K. This enhanced version was designated as the Novel vitamin K analog (Novel VK).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To better understand how vitamin K protects neurons, the team compared gene expression patterns in neural stem cells treated with MK-4, which promotes neuronal differentiation, to those treated with a compound that suppresses it. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that vitamin K-induced neuronal differentiation is mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) through downstream epigenetic and transcriptional processes. The effect of MK-4 was specifically linked to mGluR1. Previous studies have shown that mGluR1 plays a key role in synaptic communication, and that mice lacking this receptor experience motor and synaptic impairments similar to those seen in neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="insertion_middle"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delving deeper, the researchers conducted structural simulations and molecular docking studies to elucidate whether the vitamin K homolog interacts with mGluR1. Indeed, their analysis revealed a stronger binding affinity between Novel VK and mGluR1. Finally, the researchers examined the cellular uptake of Novel VK and its conversion to bioactive MK-4 in cells and mice. They noted a significant concentration-dependent increase in the intracellular concentration of MK-4. Moreover, Novel VK converted to MK-4 more easily than natural vitamin K. Further, &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; experiments in mice showed that Novel VK exhibited a stable pharmacokinetic profile, crossed the blood-brain barrier, and achieved higher MK-4 concentration in the brain compared to the control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the study sheds light on the mechanism by which vitamin K and its structural analogues exert neuroprotective effects, paving the way for the development of novel therapeutic agents that can delay or reverse neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concluding with the long-term implications of their work, Dr. Hirota says, "Our research offers a potentially groundbreaking approach to treating neurodegenerative diseases. A vitamin K-derived drug that slows the progression of Alzheimer's disease or improves its symptoms could not only improve the quality of life for patients and their families but also significantly reduce the growing societal burden of healthcare expenditures and long-term caregiving."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope their research translates into clinically meaningful treatments for patients battling neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

The number of infections is unusual for this time of year, researchers say, and could seed outbreaks in countries that are heading into winter in Asia and Europe — although it is unlikely to become a global pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 10 October, 6,013 cases of influenza virus have been reported in Japan. More than 100 schools have closed, and nearly half of the 287 people who were hospitalized for flu in September were children aged 14 or younger. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare declared a nationwide epidemic on 3 October. Outbreaks are classified as epidemics when the number of infections is higher than expected in a given area over a particular period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outbreaks of influenza virus tend to occur &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03666-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03666-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;seasonally each year&lt;/a&gt;, predominantly in winter across countries with temperate climates. In Japan, that usually occurs around the end of November. This year, the increase in people being treated for flu started five weeks earlier than usual, says Vinod Balasubramaniam, a molecular virologist at Monash University Malaysia in Subang Jaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan has had early starts to the flu season in the past few years, but not this early, says Ian Barr, a researcher and deputy director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza, who is based in Melbourne, Australia. “You might see cases in October, but not epidemic-type numbers,” says Barr.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03519-3" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03519-3" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;Increasing international travel&lt;/a&gt; since the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01315-9" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01315-9" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; is one factor that could be behind the early start to the flu season, says Balasubramaniam. Other factors include climate change and a lack of exposure to the circulating virus, particularly for elderly people and young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information about which strains are circulating in Japan has not yet emerged, but Barr says the outbreaks there could be caused by a strain of influenza A, called H3N2, that surged in Australia and New Zealand over the past two months, coinciding with the end of winter in the Southern Hemisphere. People from Australia are travelling to Japan in huge numbers, he says, meaning there are more chances for virus transmission between hemispheres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

He and his research team also found that there is a molecule that the brain can release for pain relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We focused on the lateral parabrachial nucleus (lPBN), a major entry point of sensory information from the periphery and the first site of integration of many affective behavioral states,” Betley said in a study recently published in the journal &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-09602-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Fscience%2Fhealth%2Fa69014450%2Fscientists-found-the-potential-off-button-for-stopping-chronic-pain%2F" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nature;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Populations of neurons in the lPBN […] respond to acute [pain-related] stimuli, and prolonged activation of excitatory lPBN neurons can drive a chronic pain-like state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:7;pos:1" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9119955/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:parabrachial nucleus;cpos:7;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;parabrachial nucleus&lt;/a&gt; is made up of different neuron clusters in the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK560589/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dorsolateral pons;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dorsolateral pons&lt;/a&gt; of the brainstem. Known as Y1R neurons, they transmit sensory information (such as taste and &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/environment/a23834/record-hot-years-could-be-new-normal-by-2025/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:temperature;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;temperature&lt;/a&gt;) in addition to pain, also regulating appetite and threat signals. While Y1R neurons exist in various subpopulations, what they have in common is the expression of receptors for &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00869/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neuropeptide Y or NPY;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;neuropeptide Y or NPY&lt;/a&gt;, which regulates types of brain activity like metabolism, heart rate, immune function, blood pressure, and even stress reduction. Other studies that involved monitoring neural activity and running computer models showed a link to chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Betley and his research team used painful stimuli (such as exposure to a hot surface) to activate Y1R neurons in mice, and as they predicted, the mice showed behaviors associated with persistent &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a33433129/neanderthal-low-pain-tolerance/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:pain;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;pain&lt;/a&gt;, such as paw licking. When the Y1R neurons were blocked, pain became much less persistent, and the mice only had short pain responses after being exposed to the same stimuli. There was one group of Y1R neurons that stayed active during licking, which suggests that a subpopulation of Y1R neurons is responsible for part of the Y1R response during extended periods of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Y1R neurons do not directly cause pain, they are thought to be involved in a larger network that is behind painful sensations. The way these neurons are organized allows them to receive sensory inputs, including pain signals sent from the spinal cord, which the neurons then send to multiple regions of the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:12;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a69001666/ultrasound-helmet-parkinsons-breakthrough/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain;cpos:12;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something else the researchers wanted to see was whether pain took precedence over survival. They temporarily deprived the mice of food and water and also introduced a frightening stimulus (like the scent of a &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:13;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a67955893/early-humans-eaten-by-leopards/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:predator;cpos:13;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;predator&lt;/a&gt;), and when faced with these perceived threats to their survival, the mice experienced significantly less pain. It turned out that production of neuropeptide Y increased in the parabrachial nucleus when the animals were faced with something that could literally mean life or death. Betley’s findings could mean that someday, a drug that signals neurons to produce more NPY could be a viable and safe alternative to painkillers such as opioids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This mechanism is an efficient and tunable system that enables urgent needs to shift brain state away from pain and towards other states that promote &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:14;pos:1" href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/math/a29653543/math-zombie-apocalypse/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:survival;cpos:14;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;survival&lt;/a&gt;,” he &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:15;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-09602-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Fscience%2Fhealth%2Fa69014450%2Fscientists-found-the-potential-off-button-for-stopping-chronic-pain%2F" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;cpos:15;pos:1;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. “Future work could build from these findings to test other endogenous or pharmacological interventions that curb pain state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 13:12:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPc2tlQ0hZTHRDMVJLZmtEb2dpRnAyNFlRSUxoSnVWZk1xeTQ4WDJoS1VJT1Vad2dSQU5MdnNUTWRsTllFUkZ2MzBPTVdPcFVKM2t5YzI4NXBkMldBYy1rWGNqTS1TTXNWZ2s2anMyOUpvMzFheDNrRExFRGlNMklRXzVCQTJSTnFq</guid></item><item><title>根据科学，晚餐的绝对最佳时间-雅虎</title><link>https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/absolute-best-time-eat-dinner-130000744.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;What time actually means "dinnertime" to you? It's different for all of us and may even differ from day to day. A myriad of factors impact when we eat, from our work schedules to our social calendars and those of our family members. Whether we're eating out, cooking at home, or ordering takeout also can affect our plans. There's also personal preference: Tasting Table surveyed readers on &lt;a href="https://www.tastingtable.com/1158971/what-time-do-you-prefer-to-eat-dinner-exclusive-survey/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the preferred time to eat dinner;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;the preferred time to eat dinner&lt;/a&gt;, and answers ranged from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. But the question remains, is there, in fact, a time we should be aiming for, and how important is a consistent time to our digestion and other health factors? To find out, we consulted an expert, &lt;a href="https://shopping.yahoo.com/rdlw?siteId=us-y4p&amp;amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;amp;contentUuid=8931d6b0-18b1-3310-beb1-fed1c0a43f67&amp;amp;featureId=text-link&amp;amp;linkText=Lena+Bakovic&amp;amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL2xldHNsaXZlaXR1cC5jb20vcGFnZXMvbGVuYS1iYWtvdmljIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiI4OTMxZDZiMC0xOGIxLTMzMTAtYmViMS1mZWQxYzBhNDNmNjciLCJvcmlnaW5hbFVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vbGV0c2xpdmVpdHVwLmNvbS9wYWdlcy9sZW5hLWJha292aWMifQ&amp;amp;signature=AQAAAUclh73U8Ouz_xwB8vkl0R1XTVfYKsMm5IFTxF7G02w5&amp;amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fletsliveitup.com%2Fpages%2Flena-bakovic&amp;amp;spaceId=980751755" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Lena Bakovic;elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;Lena Bakovic&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN, CNSC at Live It Up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"In my opinion, dinner should ideally be consumed at least two hours prior to bedtime (and sometimes slightly longer, depending on the individual)," Bakovic says. "This strategic timing aids with providing our digestive systems sufficient time to digest and absorb nutrients, while also helping to prevent symptoms of reflux or negatively impacting sleep." If your body hasn't had ample time to digest when you lie down, it could result in stomach pains, heartburn, and acid reflux. Plus, the calories that your body would normally convert into fuel during the day just get stored as fat if you're about to go to bed. This can lead to weight gain, while acid reflux can accumulate into long-term issues like asthma and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Read more: &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/articles/10-foods-gordon-ramsay-doesnt-122000054.html" data-ylk="slk:10 Foods Gordon Ramsay Doesn't Touch;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;10 Foods Gordon Ramsay Doesn't Touch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;How late is too late for dinner?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woman eating spaghetti at table - D3sign/Getty Images&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;That potential indigestion-related discomfort, Bakovic says, "may, in some respects, be due to the metabolic activity required to digest and absorb food." She explains, "Eating too late can also alter hormonal balance, namely insulin levels, unusually affecting blood sugar ebbs and flows." Insulin is the hormone that turns sugar into energy; it's receptive in the morning to get you ready for the day but not so much at night. Hormones that regulate your appetite and your metabolism follow your circadian rhythm, so if you push against this by eating when your body thinks it's time for bed, the way your body generates energy and feels hungry and full gets thrown off. This could lead to health issues like type 2 diabetes down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;However, that doesn't mean you have to eat at 5 p.m. if you go to bed at 9:30 p.m. "Eating dinner too early can set us up to eat more food later, in larger portions, and in late evenings or close to bedtime," Bakovic adds. Overcorrecting can just land you back in the position of needing to eat another meal later. The right dinnertime is about balance. This can take dedicated scheduling, but the health benefits are worthwhile. "Generally speaking, smaller and more frequent meals are usually quite easier to digest," the expert adds, "which can help with stabilizing energy levels." Flexibility is key in the long run, as we all know the day can get away from us.

It had dangerous stuff in it, and it made her die. Death, she explained, meant he wouldn’t see Sarah again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Two years passed before Miles and Tricia really talked about &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; she died again. It would come up randomly — at the grocery store, the park and the zoo: “Tell me how Sarah died."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As Miles grew older, he had more questions: &lt;em&gt;Where did Sarah get the medicine? Did the doctor give it to her? Could all medicines hurt you? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Sibling grief is real and powerful, but it's often overlooked, especially when the grieving sibling is a young child. In the age of widespread access to drugs like fentanyl, overdose deaths have become a heartbreaking reality for more families. For parents, that means facing the impossible task of helping their young kids make sense of loss far too early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/13/USAT/86677445007-img-6643-copy-2.jpeg?width=960&amp;amp;height=958&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" decoding="async" alt="Sarah Saponara was 21 when she died of overdose after taking a counterfeit Percocet laced with fentanyl.

She started seeking out other drugs to capture that same feeling. At first it was weed, then ketamine and Xanax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She struggled with bipolar disorder and ADHD, but when she was on drugs, she felt like her brain was balanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;By the time Sarah went to college, she didn’t have a drug of choice, but she was addicted to being in an altered state. She ended up dropping out after four semesters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;On an acid trip, she once threw herself out of a moving car on the highway. That was one of the times Tricia felt like she might lose her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Sarah’s addiction uprooted their lives. If Tricia had 100 metaphorical marbles to give to other people, she gave 96 of them to Sarah. At one point, Tricia was worried the person selling Sarah drugs would come to their house, and she sent Liliana, her then-13-year-old middle child, to go live with an uncle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The panic attacks, anxiety and anger hit Liliana in waves: &lt;em&gt;How could Sarah afford drugs, but not food? Why did she keep using? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;It took years for her to truly understand the ways addiction had taken control of Sarah’s actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It was really heartbreaking to have to experience Sarah be so dismissive,” Liliana, now 18, says, “There was a lot of anger when she died.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Though they didn’t know the name for it at the time, they were experiencing anticipatory grief — the process of grieving a future loss, which can involve feelings of anxiety, sadness and anger. With overdose-specific loss, those feelings are often more complicated and grouped with the stigma of losing someone to substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“It wasn't until after she died that I could say, we went through something horrific,” Tricia says. “It was freaking terrible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/13/USAT/86667389007-img-3271.jpeg?crop=3024,3549,x0,y356&amp;amp;width=300&amp;amp;height=353&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/13/USAT/86667389007-img-3271.jpeg?crop=3024,3549,x0,y356&amp;amp;width=600&amp;amp;height=706&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Sarah was the oldest of three siblings.

She was with her girlfriend and their roommate. Just hours after snorting the drug, Sarah awoke to find her girlfriend unresponsive beside her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Tricia got the call in the middle of the night: They were at the hospital, and Sarah's girlfriend was dead. She stayed by her daughter’s side. During a brief break to take a conference call, Tricia left the apartment. When she returned with lunch and knocked on Sarah's roommate's door, there was no answer. She and Sarah found him dead, too. A fatal overdose from the same batch of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Later, Sarah admitted they'd known the heroin had killed her girlfriend but had both used it again anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I couldn't understand why she would do that,” Tricia says. “From a distance, it's clear to me that substances have a power that I do not understand…. Her brain was no longer able to process it in a rational way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Six months later, Sarah was gone. She never forgave herself for surviving that tragedy, her mom says. She overdosed at least twice and was in the ER just three days before her death. What eventually killed her on Feb. 17, 2021, was a counterfeit Percocet, laced with fentanyl. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In that final year of Sarah’s life, Tricia hardly slept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Every morning, she checked Sarah’s location and social media. If too many hours went by without hearing from her, Tricia would drive by her apartment, heart racing, to check she was there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Even though she’d imagined the ways Sarah could die thousands of times, nothing compared to the wall of grief that hit her when it actually happened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Sarah had been the soundtrack to their lives. She played 17 instruments. At her rural conservative high school in Ashland, Virginia, she was the first openly gay member of the homecoming court and was voted class clown. When she died, it was like the music stopped. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Tricia wanted to collapse, but she had two other kids to raise. The fear was paralyzing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“One of the hardest things about parenting, when you've lost a kid to overdose, was (thinking) what role did I play in getting Sarah to where she was? And how can I make sure I don't make that same decision with my other children?" Tricia says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Liliana, seven years younger than Sarah, had memories. But Miles was just 4. How do you help a child grieve the sibling they barely knew? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/18/USAT/86219624007-overdoseloss-9.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=450&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/18/USAT/86219624007-overdoseloss-9.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;height=900&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Tricia sent Miles, 8, to a Comfort Zone Grief grief camp for kids 7 to 17 who have all lost a parent or sibling to overdose."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Tricia sent Miles, 8, to a Comfort Zone Grief grief camp for kids 7 to 17 who have all lost a parent or sibling to overdose." data-c-credit="Rachel Hale"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Parenting in the shadow of grief&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For Tricia, parenting now can feel scary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Today’s teens are navigating an ecosystem where counterfeit Oxycodone, Xanax, Percocet and Adderall are accessible on platforms like Facebook, Snapchat and Telegram. As many as six out of every 10 fake prescription pills contain a potentially lethal dose of fentanyl, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.dea.gov/alert/dea-laboratory-testing-reveals-6-out-10-fentanyl-laced-fake-prescription-pills-now-contain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Drug Enforcement Administration&lt;/a&gt;, which led the “One Pill Can Kill” &lt;a href="https://www.dea.gov/onepill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;More than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db522.htm#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20105%2C007%20drug%20overdose,decreased%20to%2031.3%20in%202023." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;100,000 people&lt;/a&gt; die from drug overdose each year in the U.S., with nearly 70% of deaths caused by synthetic opioids, &lt;a href="https://www.dea.gov/engage/operation-engage-spokane#:~:text=Drug%20Poisonings%20are%20a%20leading,fentanyl%20and%20other%20synthetic%20opioids." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;primarily fentanyl&lt;/a&gt;.

She’s had three surgeries since Sarah died and was adamant with each one that she didn’t want to use opioids, despite pushback from doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“When I told them I didn't want to use opioids, it felt like they were diminishing me and my character,” Liliana says. “I wish more people knew opioids didn't have to be the norm.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In Liliana’s room, a neon lightning bolt lightly illuminates her bed. It was her sister’s. Sarah had once nearly been struck by lightning, and that Christmas, Tricia got her the lamp and a bracelet with a poem that read: "Believe me when I tell you that girls like you are made of lightning — hard to forget and remembered by all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;There are often feelings of anger, regret and guilt that come with the loss of a loved one to overdose, and it’s important to seek out overdose-specific grief resources. When explaining an overdose death to a young child, it’s critical to tell the truth, even if it’s explained in simple terms, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.dougy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Dougy Center&lt;/a&gt;, which focuses on grief in children and families. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Tricia brings Liliana and Miles, now 8, to a local support group for those who have had a loss related to substance abuse through &lt;a href="https://fullcirclegc.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Full Circle Grief Center&lt;/a&gt; and take part in the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/graplerva/?locale=bg_BG&amp;amp;_rdr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;GRAPLE Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, a peer-lead grief support group for losses related to substance use disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Tricia also sends Liliana and Miles to a &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2025/09/25/overdose-grief-camp-fills-up-with-kids-who-lost-parents-to-opioids/86199914007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Comfort Zone Grief camp&lt;/a&gt; for kids 7 to 17 who have all lost a parent or sibling to overdose, where she also participated in a parent program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;On the ride home from camp one year, Miles remarked to Tricia: “I don’t think I remember Sarah.

It finds its own quiet places to live. In the corner of their kitchen, there’s a small space that Miles calls “Sarah’s house.” Over the years, he’s filled it with little things for her: a few photos from family trips, small toys, and, one Christmas, a tiny doll bed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“She needs a bed in her house,” he told Tricia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She smiled and asked gently, “Do you think she sleeps there?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Miles shook his head. “No,” he said. “She’s in the stars.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you or someone you love is struggling with a substance use disorder contact the &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/helplines/national-helpline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;SAMHSA National Helpline&lt;/a&gt; at 1-800-662-HELP (4357) for information and resources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rachel Hale’s role covering Youth Mental Health at USA TODAY is supported by a partnership with Pivotal and Journalism Funding Partners.

WashU researchers wondered if the reason for his continued cognitive health could help protect others against the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Doug Whitney, Alzheimer's research participant, appeared to be destined to develop Alzheimer’s disease — but against all genetic odds, he has eluded the common dementia for decades.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(UWash Medicine/Megan Farmer)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in the journal Nature Medicine, the researchers analyzed his genetic data and brain scans, identifying "changes in genes and proteins" that could explain how he has defied the odds to remain &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/mental-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;mentally sharp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also discovered that Whitney’s brain had virtually no buildup of tau, the hallmark protein that signals the onset of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/new-mri-brain-scan-predicts-alzheimers-risk-years-before-symptoms-develop" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;NEW MRI BRAIN SCAN PREDICTS ALZHEIMER'S RISK YEARS BEFORE SYMPTOMS DEVELOP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These extensive studies indicate a remarkable resistance to tau pathology and neurodegeneration," said senior study author Randall J. Bateman, M.D., the Charles F. and Joanne Knight Distinguished Professor of Neurology at WashU Medicine, in the press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Urged by his cousin, Whitney first came to WashU in 2011 to participate in a study focused on families with inherited forms of Alzheimer’s, as many of his relatives had developed early-onset disease. At the time, he believed he did not have the gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="pull-quote"&gt;&lt;p class="quote-text"&gt;"He actually was able to escape the expected course of the disease."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitney’s mother was one of 14 children, nine of whom had the Alzheimer’s gene. Ten of them died before they were 60. Whitney’s own brother developed the disease before dying at age 55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was 61 at the time — well past the age where it should have onset," he told Fox News Digital during an on-camera interview. "But they tested me, and lo and behold, I did have the gene.

"They concluded that possibly there was some gene or protein that could mutate and protect me genetically from the disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We don’t yet understand how or if heat shock proteins may be mediating the effect," Llibre-Guerra noted in the release. "However, in this case, they may be involved in preventing aggregation and misfolding of tau proteins, but we do not know for sure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="image-ct inline"&gt; &lt;div class="info"&gt;&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;"They tested me three times to make sure that there wasn't some slip-up.

"If researchers want to request those to do &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/medical-research" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;additional analysis&lt;/a&gt;, that’s something we would welcome."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitney said he is committed to helping advance Alzheimer’s research, which his wife refers to as his "third career."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It’s become my calling," he said.

And that’s for something as low stakes as a vitamin D supplement; it’s not the end of the world if I’m a little deficient. But when it comes to HIV prevention, missing a dose of your prescribed daily prevention pills could mean the difference between protection and new infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A new drug called lenacapavir might entirely change the game, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Right now, our most widely used tool to stave off HIV — which &lt;a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet"&gt;killed an estimated 630,000 people&lt;/a&gt; last year — is through prevention pills, called pre-exposure prophylaxis. PrEP works extremely well and has prevented millions of HIV infections in the 13 years it’s been around. But the catch is that it needs to be taken every single day. In much of the Global South, having &lt;a href="https://www.prepwatch.org/resources/getting-prep-rollout-right/"&gt;consistent access to it remains a big hurdle&lt;/a&gt;, on top of issues with adherence and stigma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That’s the reason why, by 2023, only about 6 million people worldwide were on PrEP, a fraction of the tens of millions who could benefit. Each year, another 1.3 million people still acquire HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But a discreet shot taken &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; twice a year, like the newly approved lenacapavir, takes forgetfulness — and some stigma — out of the equation. For a field where breakthroughs have been rare, lenacapavir has almost vaccine-like efficacy (even though it’s not one). In clinical trials, the drug showed 100 percent protection in women and approximately 96 percent in men, transgender and nonbinary people. Those are the kind of numbers policymakers can’t ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The US Food and Drug Administration approved it in June, the World Health Organization endorsed it in July, and the European Union followed in August. And the Trump administration — which &lt;a href="/future-perfect/397399/usaid-omb-purge-government-agency-spending-leave"&gt;grounded its live-saving global health work to a complete stop&lt;/a&gt; eight months ago — has recently made lenacapavir the center of its “&lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/America-First-Global-Health-Strategy-Report.pdf"&gt;America First&lt;/a&gt;” global health strategy. The administration plans to roll out the drug in about a dozen low-income countries by early 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That’s all remarkable news. Low-income countries typically have had to wait decades, if not more, before newer, better drugs trickled down. This time, at least in theory, access could come almost simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But whether lenacapavir actually makes a dent in the HIV epidemic will depend less on science than on politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;AIDS-related deaths have dropped dramatically since 2005, in large part because of PEPFAR.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Council on Foreign Relations&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Four decades ago, an HIV infection was a near-death sentence. But since then, we’ve marched toward progress — making better drugs with simpler regimens and widening access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But even after all that work, we still don’t have a cure or a true vaccine. That’s why an innovation like lenacapavir feels notable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For years, HIV drugs targeted the virus’s enzymes, and it wasn’t obvious that targeting anything else would work. Then in the 1990s, researchers backed by the National Institutes of Health began studying how the virus builds its cone-shaped shell, called the capsid. Most &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/06/23/fda-approval-lenacapavir-yeztugo-gilead-history-development-breakthrough-william-pao/"&gt;scientists dismissed it&lt;/a&gt; as “undruggable” — a smooth protein structure with no obvious place for a medicine to stick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But a small band of virologists thought differently. They spent years hunting for a molecule that could jam the capsid’s formation. After countless dead ends, that hunch paid off: The work led to lenacapavir, the first drug to successfully attack the virus’s shell and block multiple steps in its life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-pullquote _1iohv3z0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1iohv3z1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z2 xkp0cg9"&gt;“This drug is extraordinary — the closest thing to a vaccine that we have.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup _1iohv3z3"&gt;— Dr. Megan Ranney, Yale School of Public Health dean&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In a landmark clinical trial that began in 2021 and enrolled more than 2,000 teen girls and young women from South Africa and Uganda, no one who received lenacapavir contracted HIV. The effect was so striking that, in June 2024, an independent safety board told researchers to end the trial’s blinded phase early — continuing would’ve meant withholding an obviously effective drug from some participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“It would’ve been unethical not to,” said Linda-Gail Bekker, an infectious disease physician at the University of Cape Town and one of the trial’s lead investigators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Those numbers are really impressive, but lenacapavir’s efficacy as an injectable is another plus. In much of sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV burden is among the heaviest, injectable contraception is already the most widely used form of birth control. For many women, injections are more discreet and practical than taking a daily pill. “It’s a very recognized concept…injections are a very attractive option,” Bekker said. That familiarity could be the difference between a prevention tool that works in theory and one people actually use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As lenacapavir emerged from late-stage trials, with results showing near-perfect protection, the world took notice. In 2024, the editors of &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;, the prestigious scientific journal, named lenacapavir their &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/breakthrough-2024#section_breakthrough"&gt;breakthrough of the year&lt;/a&gt;. “This drug is extraordinary — the closest thing to a vaccine that we have,” said Dr. Megan Ranney, the dean of the Yale School of Public Health and one of the &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; editors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A twice-yearly shot that can nearly eliminate new infections should be the stuff of celebration. Lenacapavir could mark the beginning of the end of HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But as always in public health, the science is only half the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A breakthrough only matters if it gets off the shelf and reaches the people who need it most. And in much of the world, that depends on policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Since 2003, the US &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/pepfar/"&gt;President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief&lt;/a&gt;, or PEPFAR, has been an essential, global lever for HIV treatment access. PEPFAR is a George W. Bush-era program that has delivered lifesaving HIV treatment to poor countries and has &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/about-us-pepfar"&gt;helped save more than 25 million lives&lt;/a&gt; over its 22-year history. The program is funded by the US Congress, which renews its authority and budget — both of which can get caught up in politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;When President Donald Trump returned to office in January, he ordered a &lt;a href="/future-perfect/402944/pepfar-hiv-donald-trump-elon-musk-global-health"&gt;broad freeze on US foreign aid, throwing PEPFAR into limbo&lt;/a&gt;. Grants were halted, drug shipments stalled and USAID — the program’s main implementer — was dismantled almost overnight, stoking fears that the world’s most successful HIV program was about to be killed off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Then last month, the administration announced its &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/releases/the-united-states-presidents-emergency-plan-for-aids-relief/2025/09/pepfar-commits-to-distributing-breakthrough-hiv-drug-lenacapavir-demonstrating-american-excellence-in-science-and-american-leadership-in-hiv-prevention"&gt;plans to revive PEPFAR&lt;/a&gt; to deliver the breakthrough drug lenacapavir.

Clinics like this have been hit hard by recent US aid freezes, leaving gaps in care and prevention.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;Michel Lunanga/Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;State Department official Jeremy Lewin also made their philosophy clear during the administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/09/department-of-state-gilead-sciences-and-the-global-fund-announcement-of-lifesaving-and-innovative-pepfar-initiative"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt;. “There are no NGOs involved in this — none of those sort of beltway bandits here,” he said, referring to the aid groups that have traditionally implemented US-funded HIV programs. (It’s a loaded term and a misleading one, given that &lt;a href="https://www.stateoig.gov/uploads/report/report_pdf_file/fy-2024-coordinated-pepfar-oversight-plan.pdf"&gt;oversight bodies&lt;/a&gt; haven’t uncovered corruption at scale.) “It’s going to be the countries [who are] responsible for distributing it through their national healthcare systems.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That might sound efficient in Washington, but it’s more complicated on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That’s because HIV isn’t like cholera or the flu — something you can beat with a one-size-fits-all campaign. It affects some groups more than others and carries deep stigma, because it’s tied to sex, sexuality, and drug use, all of which are moralized in many societies. And in many countries, the state is the very institution that enforces, even criminalizes, that stigma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Bekker, who runs an HIV research center in South Africa, said that even in places without formal bans, public clinics can feel hostile to sexual and gender minorities. “The result,” she said, “is that people just don’t show up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://files.kff.org/attachment/Issue-Brief-Key-Issues-and-Questions-for-PEPFARs-Future.pdf"&gt;PEPFAR’s own history&lt;/a&gt; shows that prevention works best when community-led groups such as LGBTQ+ clinics or drop-in centers are included in the response. Those are the spaces that reach groups left out by official systems. Jirair Ratevosian, a former senior PEPFAR adviser, said ending infant infections is crucial, but so is supporting community- and faith-based clinics “where people actually feel safe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf1 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_1agbrixj"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--media--caption xptnl10"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl12"&gt;Gilead Sciences, headquartered in Foster City, California, developed lenacapavir — the twice-yearly HIV prevention shot now at the center of the US rollout.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;cite class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup xkp0cg2 xptnl11"&gt;David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Besides the Trump administration (and all its political theater), there’s one more key player: Gilead Sciences, the California-based company that developed lenacapavir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In September, Gilead made two big promises. First, it agreed to sell lenacapavir to PEPFAR at “&lt;a href="https://www.gilead.com/news/news-details/2025/gilead-announces-partnership-with-pepfar-to-deliver-twice-yearly-lenacapavir-for-hiv-prevention-for-up-to-two-million-people-in-primarily-low--and-lower-middle-income-countries"&gt;no profit&lt;/a&gt;,” although it’s unclear what that actually means. Second — and more importantly — it signed licensing deals with six generic manufacturers, sharing its technology so those companies can start preparing to make cheaper versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Typically, drug companies fiercely guard new medicines under patents for 20 years, during which time they alone can make and sell the drugs — and only countries that can afford the list price get access. Once those patents expire, generics can enter the market and drive costs down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;By making these licensing deals, Gilead is trying to shorten that wait time so, if all goes to plan, poorer countries could get lenacapavir in just a few years instead of decades later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The licensing deal allows generics to be sold in 120 low- and lower-middle-income countries, covering most of the world’s poorest nations. Once those versions hit the market, they’ll cost a fraction of Gilead’s price tag — which in the US is $28,128 a year per patient, though few people pay that sticker price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But the deal leaves out many upper-middle-income countries such as Brazil or Argentina, where infections have been rising. Those nations fall into a gray zone — too rich for cheap generics, too poor to afford Gilead’s prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For Gilead, a for-profit company, sharing its drug formula with generic makers might sound generous, but it’s not as straightforward as it looks. The licenses “carve the world into low-value markets where generics can operate [where Gilead won’t be making money anyway], and profitable ones where Gilead keeps its grip,” said Tahir Amin, an intellectual-property lawyer and co-founder of &lt;a href="https://www.i-mak.org/"&gt;Initiative for Medicines, Access, and Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit that advocates for patent reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Meanwhile, major philanthropists — the &lt;a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/media-center/press-releases/2025/09/hiv-prevention-lenacapavir"&gt;Gates Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://unitaid.org/news-blog/lenacapavir-for-hiv-prevention/"&gt;Unitaid, Clinton Health Access Initiative, and Wits RHI&lt;/a&gt; — are doing their part to help generics reach the market faster. They’re backing two Indian generic manufacturers with funding and technical support to help scale production so that low-cost versions of the drug are available by 2027. If that works, it would cost just $40 per person per year — roughly what daily oral PrEP costs today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If that happens — that is &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; we’re able to make cheaper generics faster, roll them out equitably, and deliver them where people feel safe — lenacapavir could make a real dent in the HIV epidemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 lg8ac5a xkp0cg1"&gt;Breakthrough science doesn’t guarantee a breakthrough in public health.

This quiet mineral helps you relax, sleep better, and manage stress. Yet, experts say most people don’t get enough of it through food or lifestyle habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The most overlooked mineral in modern life&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low magnesium is easy to miss because its symptoms overlap with everyday tiredness or stress. Despite being vital for more than 300 chemical reactions in the body, this mineral often goes unnoticed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Magnesium-Consumer/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;National Institutes of Health (NIH)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, magnesium supports muscle and nerve function, blood pressure control, and energy production. Yet most people don’t get enough from their diet.

It also activates the part of your nervous system that helps you relax and sleep. When levels drop, people often report anxiety, muscle tension, or disturbed sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/6/1846" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;review published in Nutrients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; and summarized by &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/should-you-take-magnesium-supplements" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Harvard Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; notes that magnesium deficiency can cause fatigue, headaches, and muscle cramps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also plays a role in heart health. Low levels have been linked to high blood pressure and arrhythmia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The modern lifestyle problem&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue is not lack of awareness. It is how we live. Diets high in processed food, chronic stress, and excess coffee or alcohol all deplete magnesium. Even sweating during workouts or living in polluted cities increases magnesium loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refined grains and packaged snacks, staples of urban diets, contain little magnesium because processing removes the nutrient-rich outer layer. Over time, this slow depletion adds up, especially for people with restrictive diets or gut issues like IBS or celiac disease that reduce absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Signs your magnesium may be low&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of magnesium deficiency appear slowly and are easy to miss.

However, magnesium levels in blood reflect only a small part of thebody’s total magnesium.

&lt;p&gt;If your mood fluctuations feel less like your usual stress and anxiety and more like the beginnings of a villain origin story (and you’re also experiencing symptoms like insomnia and feeling warmer than usual), it could be the beginning stages of perimenopause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what doctors call the transition to menopause, which is the end of a person’s reproductive years and technically marked by 12 consecutive months without a period, with the full transition taking anywhere from two to eight years, &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealth.gov/menopause/menopause-basics" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7956240" data-affiliate="true"&gt;according to the Office on Women’s Health&lt;/a&gt; (OWH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perimenopause usually begins after the age of 40 (though it can start earlier), the variabilities of which — both in ovarian function and hormone levels — can leave you feeling out of sorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s generally a confusing time that catches many of us by surprise, in large part because of how wildly unpredictable symptoms of perimenopause can be,” Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.annabarbieri-md.com" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7956240" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Anna Barbieri&lt;/a&gt;, New York-based OB-GYN and founding physician at &lt;a href="https://www.elektrahealth.com" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7956240" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Elektra Health&lt;/a&gt;, told HuffPost. “Hormonal changes, and the way symptoms show up, are anything but linear.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some, periods can still be regular in the early stages of perimenopause, making it easy to brush off mood-related symptoms (anxiety, irritability, crying spells) as being caused by things like stress, sleep deprivation or burnout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But start adding signs of cognitive decline to the mix — drawing a blank as to what someone just told you, forgetting what you walked into a room to do — and these ongoing mental blips can trigger understandable waves of panic and fear as to what exactly is going on with that mind of yours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The possible links between perimenopause and mental health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our 20s and 30s (pre-menopause), there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.menopause.org/for-women/menopauseflashes/menopause-symptoms-and-treatments/going-mad-in-perimenopause-signs-and-solutions" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7956240" data-affiliate="true"&gt;predictable ebb and flow&lt;/a&gt; to our hormones — ditto post-menopause, a time when our hormones are low, but steady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perimenopausal period is marked by one long hormonal fluctuation, with levels of estrogen and progesterone (typically referred to as “female” hormones) varying quite a bit. Testosterone — a “male” hormone that’s produced at lower levels in people assigned female at birth — takes a slow dip as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: “Your hormones are a rollercoaster, and the rest of you is along for the ride,” Barbieri said.&lt;/p&gt;

But as her due date neared, troubling symptoms crept in: sudden swelling, rapid weight gain and elevated blood pressure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day had started off perfectly. Family filled the Pearman home in Baltimore, Md., eager to meet &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shannelpearman" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Shannel Pearmen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Shannel Pearmen&lt;/a&gt; and her husband Jared’s newborn son — the first grandchild on both sides. There was food, laughter and the kind of joy that comes from gathering around a baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even as the house buzzed with happiness, Shannel was battling a nagging headache. She brushed it off as the exhaustion of new motherhood, assuming that by bedtime a little medicine would make it fade. Instead, the pain only grew worse. Her son’s cries kept her awake through the night — something that, looking back now, she says may have saved her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By morning, the headache had escalated. Without warning, Shannel was overcome by the urge to vomit. As she rushed to the bathroom, Jared followed close behind. When she looked up at him, half of his face had vanished from her vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that instant, she knew something was terribly wrong. Shannel called her mother, a nurse, who urged her to get to the hospital immediately. The couple grabbed their one-week-old baby, threw a few things into a bag and sped through the night to the emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was supposed to be one of the happiest times of my life,” Shannel, then 29, tells PEOPLE exclusively. “We had just had our first child. We were over the moon. But overnight, everything changed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannel Pearman&lt;/p&gt; Shannel Pearman and her husband Jared&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just weeks earlier, life had felt picture-perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was June 2019, and Shannel had built the life she always dreamed of: a thriving career as a TV reporter, a loving husband in Jared — a photographer she met while working at a station — and a home in Baltimore. The couple had been eagerly awaiting the arrival of their first child, a son due in May 2019, and for most of her pregnancy, everything went exactly as she hoped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was my first child. I was glowing and happy, just wanting to rub my belly and enjoy it,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as her due date neared, troubling symptoms crept in: sudden swelling, rapid weight gain and elevated blood pressure. Shannel voiced her concerns repeatedly, but says they were brushed aside. “Everyone kept telling me it was normal — that the swelling would go down.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, her condition worsened. At 41 weeks, she was induced and labored for hours before doctors determined an emergency C-section was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because of the surgery, I couldn’t hold my son right away,” she recalls. “That was so emotional. I had just given birth, my son was here, but I couldn’t hold him yet. I just couldn’t wait to finally have him in my arms. When the moment finally came in the early hours of the morning, even though I was exhausted, it was one of the best feelings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannel Pearman&lt;/p&gt; Shannel Pearman and her husband Jared with their newborn son&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the troubling symptoms didn’t disappear. Shannel left the hospital with reassurances that everything was fine — that the swelling was normal and would resolve with time. She was told to come back in six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just one week later, on June 1, 2019, a splitting headache and blurred vision sent her racing back to the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What followed was a blur. Doctors shuffled her between units — labor and delivery, then other departments — but never ordered a CT scan. Hours slipped by. It wasn’t until her mother arrived from Delaware and demanded answers that a scan was finally performed. That’s when they discovered the truth: Shannel was in the middle of a &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23969-hemorrhagic-stroke" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:hemorrhagic stroke;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;hemorrhagic stroke&lt;/a&gt;, caused by a ruptured blood vessel in her brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was disbelief,” she says. “I was 29 years old. I was healthy. I had no health issues. I had just been in the hospital. Everything seemed fine. We didn’t think anything seriously wrong was happening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannel Pearman&lt;/p&gt; Shannel Pearman in the hospital&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long after, Shannel lost consciousness. The last thing she remembers is sitting in the ER holding her newborn as medical teams tried to comfort her. From there, she was rushed into emergency brain surgery, during which doctors removed half of her skull to relieve the swelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her next clear memory is waking up in a different hospital. She remembers fumbling with her phone, trying to send texts until someone enlarged the font so she could read the words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The first few days felt like an out-of-body experience,” she says. “I had lost my left peripheral vision in both eyes. Waking up and not being able to see was emotional. But more than anything, I was just thankful to be alive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannel Pearman&lt;/p&gt; Shannel Pearman in the hospital after her stroke&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even before her stroke, Shannel, now 35, had planned to breastfeed her son. It had taken a few days to find a rhythm with him — and just as she did, everything changed. But her family refused to let that dream slip away. While she was in the ICU, Jared taught himself how to use a breast pump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No one there knew how — I was the youngest patient on the floor — so my husband had to figure it out himself,” she says. Relatives pitched in, creating a relay system: pumping, cleaning parts and driving milk from the hospital to their baby so she could continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Something my family always noted is that no matter what I was going through, whenever I spoke, I was full of positivity,” she adds. “I was excited about what life could look like after I got through all of this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her optimism carried her, but recovery was grueling. Shannel spent less than a week in the hospital before she was discharged, but until her second surgery on July 25, she had to wear a protective helmet anytime she wasn’t sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I hated that thing,” she admits. “It was so bulky and uncomfortable, and I had to wear it constantly. I’m thankful for its purpose — it protected my head — but I couldn’t wait to be rid of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When her helmet finally came off, it felt like freedom — yet the relief was paired with a sobering truth: nothing was going back to the way it was. She would not return to work, she could no longer drive and her vision would never fully come back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the help of occupational therapists and specialists, Shannel began to relearn how to navigate life. Still, at first, she didn’t fully understand what living with a brain injury would mean. Weeks — even months — passed before the reality truly set in. She had regained the ability to walk and talk, but invisible struggles remained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I struggle with processing, with crippling migraines, with reading and speaking sometimes,” Shannel explains. “There are moments when I can’t find the word I want or can’t get it out. And because the disabilities are invisible, it makes it even more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Essentially everything I do now is impacted by my brain injury,” she adds. “Something as simple as writing on paper takes extra effort. Everything has changed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannel Pearman&lt;/p&gt; Shannel Pearman wearing her helmet and holding her son&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back, Shannel says that rather than hide what she was going through, she made a different choice: to share it. Just days after leaving the hospital, she posted updates on Instagram — helmet on, baby in hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what began as personal updates for friends and family soon grew into something larger, as strangers connected with her honesty. Today, she uses that platform to raise awareness about maternal health, Black maternal health and stroke among young people — issues she admits she barely knew about before her ordeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her posts have since reached millions, including one video of her struggling to recall the color yellow. That clip alone has been &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shannelpearman/video/7536997510041193758" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:viewed more than 6.6 million times;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;viewed more than 6.6 million times&lt;/a&gt; and drawn over 16,000 comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When that one picked up traction, I was so surprised because honestly, I didn’t even want to post it,” she admits. “I share so much of my journey, but that moment felt too raw, too vulnerable. I thought it was embarrassing. But my husband captured it, and I thought, maybe I should share — because it’s one thing to hear me talk about the struggle, it’s another to actually see it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, she posted the clip and logged off, too nervous to check. When she finally returned, the response floored her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was taken aback that this video — the one I almost didn’t post — was getting millions of views,” she says with a laugh. “But then I started reading the comments, and it made me emotional."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On one hand, there was so much love and encouragement from strangers cheering me on," she adds. "And on the other hand, there were people who could relate. That broke my heart, but it also made me grateful. Because for them, seeing that video meant they weren’t alone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, one of the hardest things she’s shared publicly has been her decision about whether to have another child. She and Jared had always dreamed of a bigger family, but after the stroke, the idea felt terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Part of me felt like the stroke had robbed me of so much,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It took a year and a half of therapy, medical consultations and prayer before they were ready to even consider it. Ultimately, they made a plan — and when Shannel became pregnant again, joy came with new fears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her second pregnancy wasn’t easy. PTSD triggered anxiety and depression, but she carried on and eventually welcomed a daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our family is complete,” she says with a laugh. “We have our baby boy, our baby girl. Confidently, we are never having another child again — I cannot go through this again. Our family is complete, and it is perfect.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannel Pearman&lt;/p&gt; Shannel Pearman and her husband Jared and kids&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, she says her focus is simple: “surviving the day.” Her symptoms remain unpredictable; stress, overstimulation or bright light can trigger severe migraines. She relies on Nurtec for relief, plus supplements and calming routines — coffee, hydration, slow mornings — to reduce risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, life with two little ones and a brain injury is anything but quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Where my brain needs peace and quiet, my kids give me everything but that,” she laughs. “I’m just trying to show up and be the best mom I can be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She’s even started talking to her son about her disability. “He’s six now, and that has been heartbreaking. The first conversation I had with him was explaining that I’m visually impaired, or ‘partially blind,’ as I say to him, and that’s why Mommy doesn’t drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had a suspicion he already knew, because sometimes he’d test me — like standing on my left side to see if I could see him," she adds. "When I finally sat him down, he could repeat back what I said, but I don’t think he fully understands. For my sixth stroke anniversary, we watched some of my videos together, and he recognizes when I’m in a hospital gown — he’ll say, ‘That’s a stroke video, Mommy had a stroke.’ But I don’t think he quite grasps what that means.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on her journey, Shannel’s voice softens and tears fill her eyes. “I hate that it has happened, and I hate that I’m disabled,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years after her stroke, the weight of her new reality hit hard. She wasn’t going back to work as a reporter. She couldn’t drive. Depression took hold, and dark days stretched on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But last year marked a turning point. She realized she could sit in bed all day and cry, but life wouldn’t wait. Her children were growing, and she had been given a second chance — a new opportunity she couldn’t waste. “I can’t just rot away — I don’t deserve that, my kids don’t deserve that, my husband doesn’t deserve that,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for&lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk: PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt; PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So she made a conscious choice to embrace the life she still had. “Yes, this sucks, but I’m going to live. I’ll take my kids to the Maryland State Fair, and maybe I’ll have a migraine afterward — but it’s okay. We’ll roll with the punches. Since making that shift, I’ve been able to truly be happy in this space. My old self would be proud of that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her outlook has transformed.

&lt;p&gt;It’s invisible, it’s lethal, and it’s been with us for decades, but carbon monoxide poisoning can now be fought with the first-ever antidote that rapidly removes the toxic molecule from the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon monoxide or CO, poisoning accounts for 50,000 emergency room visits in the US each year and causes about 1,500 deaths, each one being lamented as a shameful waste and tragic oversight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the only treatments for CO poisoning are oxygen-based therapies, which help the body eliminate the toxic gas. However, even with treatment, nearly half of survivors suffer long-term heart and brain damage. This has created an urgent need for faster, more effective interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study &lt;a href="https://www.medschool.umaryland.edu/news/2025/new-protein-therapy-shows-promise-as-first-ever-antidote-for-carbon-monoxide-poisoning.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; by University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) in &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2501389122" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;PNAS&lt;/a&gt;, the research team developed a new engineered protein-based therapy called RcoM-HBD-CCC, which acts like a sponge to soak up carbon monoxide from the blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RcoM (short for “regulator of metabolism”) is a natural protein isolated from the bacterium &lt;em&gt;Paraburkholderia xenovorans &lt;/em&gt;which uses it to sense minute levels of carbon monoxide in its environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers engineered a version that is highly selective, grabbing CO without interfering with oxygen or other important molecules in the bloodstream like nitric oxide, which is vital for the regulation of blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In tests on mice, the new therapy worked quickly to remove CO from red blood cells and was safely flushed out of the body through urine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CO is known commonly as the “silent killer,” because this odorless, invisible gas, typically released from combustion sources, including stovetops, propane heaters, car exhausts, and firewood, poisons in a gradual manner that isn’t immediately obvious to the victim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE FIRST AID ADVANCES: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Revolutionary Antidote Neutralizes Venom of 19 of World’s Deadliest Snakes–Thanks to Man Who Immunized Himself" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/revolutionary-new-antidote-neutralizes-venom-of-19-of-the-worlds-deadliest-snakes/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Revolutionary Antidote Neutralizes Venom of 19 of World’s Deadliest Snakes–Thanks to Man Who Immunized Himself&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In healthy bodies, oxygen inhaled from the air binds to the protein hemoglobin on the surface of red blood cells, which then ferry the oxygen to all the tissues of the body. CO however, competes with oxygen for hemoglobin. It enters the bloodstream and binds to hemoglobin with a 200 to 400-fold greater affinity than oxygen. That means CO hogs most of the hemoglobin seats, so not enough oxygen molecules can get a ride to the tissues that need them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the only available treatments for carbon monoxide poisoning involve giving 100% pure oxygen, sometimes under pressure in a hyperbaric chamber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All too often, patients are not transported, diagnosed, and treated in time to reverse the effects of CO poisoning, which can cause lasting cardiac and neurological injuries or even death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MORE HOUSEHOLD TOXINS DEFEATED: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a title="Flint Finishes Replacing 11,000 Lead Pipes, Concluding Activists’ Decade-Long Effort to Secure Clean Water" href="https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/flint-finishes-replacing-11000-lead-pipes-concluding-activists-decade-long-effort-to-secure-clean-water/" rel="bookmark"&gt;Flint Finishes Replacing 11,000 Lead Pipes, Concluding Activists’ Decade-Long Effort to Secure Clean Water&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infused in the bloodstream, scavenger hemoproteins like RcoM-HBD-CCC rapidly bind to carbon monoxide molecules, reducing the time it takes to clear half of the carbon monoxide in the blood to less than a minute, compared to more than hour with pure oxygen therapy and five hours without any treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A potential drawback the researchers were aware of is that so-called “scavengers” like RcoM also have an affinity for oxygen, and so may uptake the nitric oxide mentioned earlier. This can cause wild and potentially unsafe changes in blood pressure, but RcoM-HBD-CCC caused no such side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unlike other protein-based treatments, we found the compound caused only minimal changes in blood pressure, which was an exciting finding and raised the potential for this new molecule to have clinical applications,” said study corresponding author Mark T. Gladwin, MD, Dean of UMSOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This has the potential to become a rapid, intravenous antidote for carbon monoxide that could be given in the emergency department or even in the field by first-responders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future studies will likely include more pre-clinical research to determine the safe and effective dosage range for RcoM-HBD-CCC in treating carbon monoxide poisoning. It could also form the basis for new research in other fields, including as an oxygen delivery therapy or blood substitute. This could include hemorrhagic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), severe anemias, and the preservation of organs for transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Andrew Miller knew something was up. The North Carolina pediatrician saw nearly a dozen new patients at his practice over the span of a couple of weeks last year, all of whom were opting out of their children receiving some or all vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the pattern became clear, Miller, a board-certified physician who supports the vaccine schedule, eventually asked a patient how they found his practice. “Well, you know, you’re on that website,” the patient told him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;    


&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website, it turned out, is “Dr. Green Mom,” a blog with an affiliated supplements company run by Ashley Mayer. Mayer is a &lt;a href="https://hpa.unc.edu/explore/explore-health-careers/naturopathic-medicine/"&gt;naturopathic doctor&lt;/a&gt; who describes herself as “vaccine-neutral” and who sells her own &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/inspections-compliance-enforcement-and-criminal-investigations/warning-letters/dr-green-mom-llc-644546-01302023"&gt;supplements&lt;/a&gt;, including products like “VaxClear” that she claims helps with “toxin elimination” during vaccination. She also maintains a database of doctors in each state who are friendly towards or tolerant of families who forgo some or even all vaccines—and Miller is on that list.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I agree very little with what is on the Dr. Green Mom site, and I think it mostly operates in a pseudoscience fashion,” Miller told &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt;. But he also wants parents turning to sources like Dr. Green Mom to be exposed to sound medical science and understand the safety and necessity of vaccination. Miller welcomes patients who refuse some or even all vaccines into his practice, a position at odds with a growing number of pediatric practices across the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distrust of vaccines and immunization guidance had been on the rise since before the COVID pandemic, and childhood vaccination rates had been slipping for years. But the pandemic worsened these trends. President Donald Trump’s elevation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as the health and human services secretary exacerbated existing political polarization around vaccines and emboldened purveyors of false and misleading medical information, fueling an even more chaotic information environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For primary care physicians and pediatricians, dealing with parents who don’t believe in most or all childhood vaccines, are skeptical of some immunizations, or are just plain confused has become a much more challenging task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some pediatric offices have adopted policies of dropping current patients or not accepting new families if they refuse to vaccinate their children. A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2770611"&gt;2019 survey&lt;/a&gt; of U.S. pediatric offices published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of American Medicine&lt;/em&gt; (JAMA) found that 51 percent of pediatricians reported that their offices had a policy requiring the dismissal of patients refusing vaccines, although only 37 percent of pediatricians reported often or always dropping such patients. Private practices were far more likely to have dismissal policies than hospitals or community health centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear just how widespread the practice of dropping patients who refuse vaccinations is since there's a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7227633/#CIT0009"&gt;dearth&lt;/a&gt; of studies on the topic. The 2019 survey is one of just a handful on the subject in the last two decades. Still, the literature shows an increasing trend. A 2012 survey using the same methodology as the 2019 version found only &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/136/6/1103/33879/Characteristics-of-Physicians-Who-Dismiss-Families?redirectedFrom=fulltext#:~:text=21%25%20of%20Peds%20and%204%25%20of%20FPs%20reported%20always/often%20dismissing%20families%20if%20they%20refused%20%E2%89%A51%20vaccine"&gt;21 percent&lt;/a&gt; of pediatricians dismissed families for vaccine refusal. “I think the prevalence of these policies has gone up, I don’t know by how much, though,” Sean O’Leary—a pediatric-infectious disease doctor and researcher at the University of Colorado who co-authored both surveys—told &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt;, noting that the 2019 survey has not been updated.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proliferation of dismissal policies is one factor driving vaccine skeptical parents to sites like Dr. Green Mom. After Miller found out he was on the site’s list as a doctor willing to treat the children of vaccine-skeptical parents, he decided against trying to have his name removed. Today, the vast majority of his new patients are undervaccinated or nonvaccinated, many of them arriving at his practice by way of the list but also from moms’ Facebook groups and word of mouth. Approximately two dozen of these patients commute more than an hour to Miller’s Durham, North Carolina, practice, he said; some drive up to four hours just to see him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pediatric clinic is affiliated with Duke Health, a private, nonprofit health care system that strongly encourages full vaccination but does not allow patient dismissals based on vaccination status. “That physician-patient relationship is an incredibly important one, and while there are things that could terminate that, they’re very few and far between,” said Miller, who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; in his personal capacity, not as a representative of his practice or Duke. “My job is to be there for the patient, even if they don’t really listen to me and do everything that I say.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The influx has included some of Miller’s new favorite patients. “They’re thoughtful, intelligent people. Many of them actually end up getting vaccines, either some or all, but they’re just looking for someone who is willing to have those conversations and dive in deep with them and treat them as someone capable of handling and thinking through that information,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When discussing vaccination, Miller said, he sets boundaries with new patients. He tells parents that there are black-and-white situations when a patient’s life could be at extreme risk by refusal of a vaccine, and in those cases, he will insist on certain actions. For example, if a mother has Hepatitis B or is unsure whether she has the disease or is untested, he’s adamant that children receive the Hep B vaccine immediately. But if both parents have been tested, and there’s no additional risk factors like drug use in the home, then for Miller, opting out of the vaccine is within the purview of parental choice. “I feel my job as the clinician is not to coerce, it’s not to belittle or shame,” he said. “My job is to educate and to explain.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The number of clinics who are willing to engage and see this population is dwindling.

            &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Anna Ruderman, one of Miller’s colleagues who shared her personal views with &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt;, agrees that patients should not be dismissed for vaccine refusals. She believes that parents should be treated with compassion and will discuss with parents the risks of foregoing or spreading out specific vaccines. But she said decisions to depart from the vaccine schedule can be fraught, sometimes leading parents to misevaluate the importance of the guidelines. “It’s so hard because you run into this slippery slope of,  ‘Oh, well, they said this one wasn’t important,’ but they’re all important,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt; “Vaccines are by far the safest things we do as a pediatrician,” she added. “If we did no other parts of our job and just did the vaccines, that would save more lives than anything else that we do.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruderman has experienced more and more families declining vaccines, many based on false and misleading information. “I spent an extra hour with a patient today in my busy clinic schedule, discussing all of the misinformation and all of the fear that the parent felt, and going through all of the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/trump-expected-link-autism-with-tylenol-experts-say-more-research-needed-2025-09-22/"&gt;false information&lt;/a&gt; like Tylenol or vaccines cause autism,” she said, noting the parent was getting her information from TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller fears the growth of dismissal policies will drive more families toward bad information and medical advice. “The number of clinics who are willing to engage and see this population is dwindling,” he said. “These people are going to end up in these echo-chamber clinics that are telling them what they already want to hear, which I would argue is bad medicine. We really need to keep people within our clinics and keep it so that they can continue to be exposed to the good and healthy ideas, even if that makes it more challenging for us.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many pediatricians take a different approach. The reasons for dismissal policies can vary. Some practices worry about the legal liability of not vaccinating children who later contract vaccine-preventable diseases, although many offices require parents to sign a vaccine refusal form designed to mitigate liability risk. Other providers are concerned about the time involved in working with and persuading parents of non-vaccinated patients, reducing available time for others in practices that are often already booked out months in advance for new patients. (Pediatrics is one of the specialties that’s been &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/11/27/pediatrics-residency-match-pay-pediatrician-shortage/"&gt;hit hard&lt;/a&gt; by the national shortage of doctors.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the primary driver of dismissal policies seems to be a desire to incentivize higher vaccination rates and to protect people in clinics from potential increased risk of exposure to disease. Indeed, outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease have triggered the adoption of dismissal policies by many medical practices. O’Leary, the pediatrics researcher, said he noticed an uptick after the 2014-15 Disneyland measles outbreak that sickened more than 100 kids in California and even spread to Canada, sparking an outbreak of 150 more cases.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the&lt;em&gt; Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-03-27/should-doctors-kick-out-unvaccinated-children-pediatricians-face-dilemma#:~:text=Orange%20County%20pediatrician,young%20or%20immunocompromised."&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, a California pediatric clinic near the epicenter of the outbreak had allowed parents of patients to refuse vaccines. Doctors in the practice felt responsible for the spread of the disease among patients who choose to not receive the measles vaccine, putting at risk not only that cohort but also other patients who were immunocompromised, or too young to be vaccinated. “We had extremely low vaccination rates, and frankly, I think, a lot of our physicians and our patients became complacent; they weren’t seeing these diseases,” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/rzGcEhQXAV0"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Dr. Eric Ball, a partner at the practice. “And then we started having kids with measles come into our office.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We had babies and other people exposed in our waiting room to children who had measles. We had adults contract measles in our office. This was a huge wake-up call for all of us,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak resulted in pro-vaccine parents pressuring some pediatricians to put dismissal policies in place. “For some of the practices, they may have been on the fence about whether or not to have a policy like this, but then they started hearing it from parents in their practice, saying, ‘We like you guys and all, but we don’t want to bring our kids where they might pick up measles, so we’re going to go to the practice down the street that doesn’t accept non-vaccinators,’” O’Leary said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropping patients for refusing vaccines used to be a rarity and was actively discouraged by medical groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). In 2005, AAP issued &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7227633/#CIT0032:~:text=In%202005%2C%20the%20AAP%20recommended%20that%20%E2%80%9Cpediatricians%20should%20avoid%20discharging%20patients%20from%20their%20practice%20solely%20because%20a%20parent%20refuses%20to%20immunize%20his%20or%20her%20child.%E2%80%9D32"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt; that “pediatricians should avoid discharging patients from their practice solely because a parent refuses to immunize his or her child.” In 2013, the guidance was changed from “should avoid discharging” to “should endeavor not to discharge.” But &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/138/3/e20162146/52702/Countering-Vaccine-Hesitancy"&gt;in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, the group softly endorsed the practice, writing that “a pediatrician may consider dismissal of families who refuse vaccination as an acceptable option” but emphasizing that such move “is not one that should be made lightly, nor should it be made without considering and respecting the reasons for the parents’ point of view.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pediatric practices in North Carolina have also &lt;a href="https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2019/05/07/no-shots-no-service-pediatricians-take-tough-stands-while-vaccination-rates-for-young-children-in-n-c-drop/"&gt;tightened&lt;/a&gt; their policies in recent years, following outbreaks and increased cases of vaccine-preventable diseases like whooping cough. Several clinics reported the crackdown resulted in more parents choosing to vaccinate. But beyond anecdotes, there’s little evidence on whether dismissal policies result in higher aggregate vaccination rates beyond a particular practice. O’Leary said that pediatricians he talks to often think their practices’ policies result in more vaccination, but “we don’t have data on that.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He thinks ousting patients for vaccine refusal could, in practice, do more harm than good, citing the unknowns of where such patients will turn to for care next and how dismissal affects families’ trust in the medical system. While vaccination rates are slipping in some areas, they are &lt;a href="https://thedispatch.com/article/vaccines-back-to-school-rfk-oster/"&gt;still high&lt;/a&gt; nationally, and O’Leary &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMclde2407983"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that aside from areas experiencing an active outbreak, there’s no evidence that seeing unvaccinated patients increases the likelihood of the spread of vaccine-preventable diseases within a practice. It’s possible that the proliferation of dismissal policies could actually increase the risk of spreading disease if more non-vaccinated and under-vaccinated patients begin to cluster at a narrowing number of clinics that agree to see them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As vaccines become a more divisive and politically polarized topic, some pediatricians argue that the specter of dismissal is more likely to drive families away than incentivize them to vaccinate their children. If under-vaccination before the pandemic was more a product of complacency, a new policy could serve as a helpful nudge to parents and signal how important their doctors think immunization should be. But if under-vaccination is now more the result of confusion or fear, dismissal policies can simply seem coercive. “At one point it may have been an incentive, but I don’t know that it still is,” Ruderman said.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least some local health officials are actively encouraging physicians to turn away from dismissal policies. In Michigan’s Oakland County, the health department had previously encouraged clinics to adopt dismissal policies, but officials &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X24008089?fr=RR-2&amp;amp;ref=pdf_download&amp;amp;rr=98e1e7ce5f1631cb"&gt;changed course&lt;/a&gt; after they became concerned the approach was actually harming vaccine uptake. The county has since embraced a “harm reduction” approach designed to help educate clinicians on vaccine hesitancy and strategies to improve vaccine coverage aside from zero-tolerance dismissal policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pressure on pediatricians will continue to increase as misinformation and confusion around immunizations spread and red and blue states pursue diverging vaccine policies. While trust in public health authorities around vaccines has plummeted, pediatricians remain the only source of vaccine information trusted by large majorities across political affiliations: A &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/10/10/pediatricians-vaccine-trust-influencers-rfk-jr/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;-KFF poll&lt;/a&gt; released last week found that 85 percent of all parents trust their pediatricians’ advice on shots, including 93 percent of Democrats and 85 percent of Republicans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poll also found that only 12 percent of U.S. parents who trust their pediatrician skipped or delayed a vaccine, other than for COVID or the flu, but that number jumps to 41 percent among parents who distrust their pediatricians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2024, AAP released &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/153/3/e2023065483/196695/Strategies-for-Improving-Vaccine-Communication-and"&gt;additional guidance&lt;/a&gt; that O’Leary co-authored on vaccine dismissals. The update still says patient dismissal for refusing vaccines is an acceptable option for medical practitioners, but places even more emphasis on treating dismissal as a last resort “after repeated attempts to help understand and address parental values and vaccine concerns, engender trust, and strengthen the therapeutic alliance” and after “less drastic alternatives” are considered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="rich-text core-paragraph"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Miller, building trust with patients is incompatible with the pressure of a dismissal policy. “[If] we say, ‘Do this or else,’ maybe they do choose to get one more vaccine that day in that clinical encounter,” Miller said. “But what I’ve done is further undercut the trust and the relationship that I had with them before, and I’m ultimately losing them in the long run, from becoming a part of what I think is the good practice of medicine for vaccinations.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alcohol is a leading cause of cancer across Europe, and experts say stronger government policies to curb drinking could prevent thousands of cancer cases and deaths each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the European Union alone, the subregion with the &lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/04/05/dry-january-where-in-europe-is-drinking-alcohol-getting-worse-and-which-countries-have-cut"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;heaviest alcohol consumption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the world, alcohol caused more than 111,000 new cancer cases in 2020, according to the new scientific review from the World Health Organization's (WHO) cancer research agency, known as the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).&lt;/p&gt;        

&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, that number reached an estimated 741,000 cases, with men accounting for almost 70 per cent of new cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the health consequences, the economic toll is also substantial: according to WHO, premature deaths from alcohol-related cancers cost €4.58 billion in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The WHO European Region, and especially countries of the EU, are paying too high a price for alcohol in preventable cancers and broken families, as well as costing billions to taxpayers,” said Dr Gundo Weiler, who leads prevention and health promotion efforts at WHO's Europe office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some call alcohol a ‘cultural heritage’, but disease, death, and disability should not be normalised as part of European culture," he added.&lt;/p&gt;  

&lt;h2&gt;How alcohol is linked to cancer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IARC first classified alcohol as carcinogenic in 1988. It says alcohol raises the risk of at least seven types of cancer, including cancers of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, liver, colorectum, and female breast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe alcohol causes cancer through multiple mechanisms, including altered hormone levels, changes to the gut microbiome, and DNA damage from oxidative stress and the metabolite acetaldehyde, which is found in ethanol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reducing or quitting alcohol lowers the risk of developing these cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
  

&lt;p&gt;Most alcohol-attributable cancers are linked to “risky” drinking (two to six alcoholic drinks per day) and “heavy” drinking (more than six drinks per day), according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, even “moderate” drinking (fewer than two drinks per day) was responsible for more than 100,000 new cancer cases globally in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Strategies to reduce risks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new analysis marked the first time IARC has evaluated the potential benefits of alcohol-related cancer prevention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It "establishes with no further doubt that population-wide alcohol policies reduce drinking, and that reduced drinking lowers cancer risk," said IARC director Dr Elisabete Weiderpass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency pushed for measures such as higher taxes, minimum prices, and raising the legal drinking age, as well as limiting the density of alcohol retailers, restricting hours or days of sale, banning alcohol marketing, and implementing government-controlled alcohol sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These policies all help to reduce drinking and, in turn, lower cancer risk, IARC said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a&lt;a href="https://www.iarc.who.int/news-events/modelling-the-impact-of-increased-alcohol-taxation-on-alcohol-attributable-cancers-in-the-who-european-region" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2021 study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;found that doubling alcohol excise taxes could have prevented 6 per cent of new alcohol-related cancer cases and deaths in 2019 in the WHO's European region, which spans Europe and Central Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Raising awareness about the cancer risks of alcohol and the fact that no level of drinking is safe is critical,” said Dr Béatrice Lauby-Secretan, deputy head of IARC's evidence synthesis and classification branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone has a role to play in changing the current norms and values surrounding alcohol consumption," she added.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;

Antidepressants had similar carryover effects, as did proton pump inhibitors, medications millions take for acid reflux and heartburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The microbiome is the body's collection of beneficial bacteria. Its health relies on a diverse population of bacteria to fight disease, absorb nutrients and regulate immune and metabolic systems. It is influenced by everything from diet and lifestyle to the medications a person takes, including common prescription drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study confirmed that commonly prescribed medications, ranging from antibiotics to antidepressants, consistently reduce the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13882945/The-microbiome-miracle-Good-bacteria-dont-just-live-gut-body-help-ward-deadly-illnesses-cancers-infections-doctors-reveal-nurture-ultimate-guide.html"&gt;diversity of gut bacteria&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes for years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A less diverse microbiome is linked to a weaker gut barrier, chronic inflammation and a compromised immune system. This state of imbalance, known as dysbiosis, creates a state of chronic inflammation and weakened immune defense that is a recognized breeding ground &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14639877/Scientists-cancer-diet-mistake-gut-health-leukemia.html"&gt;for cancer development&lt;/a&gt;, specifically, colorectal &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-5bca6ea0-a862-11f0-b36e-c3dba671310f"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dysbiosis creates a gut environment dominated by cancer-promoting bacteria, which can trigger tumor growth by stimulating blood vessel formation, uncontrolled cell division and the evasion of cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;The Estonian team's findings impact tens of millions of Americans. Annually, hundreds of millions of antibiotic prescriptions are written, while about 30 million people each take benzodiazepines, beta-blockers or SSRIs (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To investigate the long-term effects of medications on gut bacteria, an Estonian study genetically analyzed stool samples from 2,509 adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By revisiting 328 of them four years later with new samples and checking their prescription records, they pinpointed the effects of common drugs like acid reflux pills, antidepressants and anxiety medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ninety percent of 186 medications tested disrupted the gut microbiome, and for many, including antibiotics, antidepressants and proton pump inhibitors, the effects persisted for over three years after the last dose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antibiotics have the most severe and long-lasting impact on the gut microbiome. The study found that the effects of drugs like azithromycin and penicillin remain detectable for over three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The reduction in bacterial diversity from antibiotics never fully recovered, suggesting the damage is permanent or lasts for many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Like antibiotics, benzodiazepines were associated with fewer species of bacteria, changing the overall composition of the gut microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The drugs' effects persisted for over three years and were cumulative, with more prescriptions leading to greater gut imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among all non-antibiotic drugs, beta-blockers were one of the top disruptors of the gut microbiome, accounting for a significant portion of the variation in people's gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) also caused long-term damage to the gut microbiome, reducing diversity and creating a pro-inflammatory state that can fuel cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These changes to people's microbial ecosystems persisted for years after people stopped taking the medication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The second round of testing, though smaller, solidly proved that proton pump inhibitors and various antibiotics also have lasting impacts on the gut microbiome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A dysbiotic gut often has a ‘leaky’ barrier, allowing bacteria and their toxins to enter the bloodstream. This triggers a persistent, low-grade inflammatory state throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A depleted microbiome is less effective at detoxifying harmful compounds and produces lower levels of protective molecules like butyrate, leaving the body more vulnerable to exposures or events that damage the cells’ DNA and can initiate the development of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers deduced in 2024 that changes in the gut microbiome, including the proliferation of bad bacteria, including some previously unknown strains, has been linked to &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-70702-1"&gt;between 23 and 40 percent&lt;/a&gt; of colorectal cancer cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They proved that these newly discovered bacteria can directly trigger the growth of precancerous growths in the colon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also found that the gut microbiome can create a pre-cancerous environment by causing changes in colon cells that are crucial for the structural integrity of tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption" aria-label="To enrich screen reader interactions, please activate Accessibility in Grammarly extension settings"&gt;The bar graph portion of the graphic shows that beta-blockers were the top disruptor. The study used a color-coded chart (in shades of blue below) to show that most common medications are strongly linked to a major loss of gut bacterial diversity. Darker shades of blue indicated a stronger negative correlation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Oliver Aasmets of the University of Tartu Institute of Genomics and lead author of the latest Estonian study, said in a statement: ‘Most microbiome studies only consider current medications, but our results show that past drug use can be just as important as it is a surprisingly strong factor in explaining individual microbiome differences.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their findings were published in the journal &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/msystems.00541-25"&gt;mSystems&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These findings apply to tens of millions of Americans. In the US, healthcare providers wrote approximately 270 million antibiotic prescriptions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 30 million Americans take benzodiazepines and 30 million take beta-blockers. Further, approximately 30 million Americans take SSRIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

with MND a decade ago and uses a ventilator at night. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Mr Setters said that after the NHS decision that MND patients no longer qualified, patients were "being turned away" from their GP and directed to a pharmacy where the vaccine costs about £100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said doctors and

progressive, neurological disease that gradually destroys motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;It is usually life-shortening and there is currently no cure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;It causes muscle weakness, and over time can lead to difficulty moving, with patients needing a ventilator to help them breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Describing his condition, Mr Setters said: "My breathing is compromised and I have to use overnight non-invasive ventilation to make sure sufficient carbon dioxide is extracted from my body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Any infection, especially a serious one like Covid, could be very serious for

class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The World Health Organization sounded the alarm Monday about a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/13-10-2025-who-warns-of-widespread-resistance-to-common-antibiotics-worldwide" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;growing threat of drug-resistant bacteria&lt;/a&gt; around the globe that could undermine life-saving treatments, an issue Wayne State University researchers have been warning about for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;One in 6 laboratory-confirmed bacterial infections that led to common infections in people worldwide in 2023 were resistant to antibiotic treatments, according to a WHO report released Monday that reviewed data from more than 100 countries. From 2018-23, antibiotic resistance increased in more than 40% of the pathogen-antibiotic combinations monitored, rising to more than 70% in some African nations, the report found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;This growing threat to global health, including in the United States, compromises the ability of antibiotics and other drugs to treat infections and protect patients during surgeries, said WHO officials, who called the growing resistance to antibiotics "widespread, increasing and unevenly distributed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Antimicrobial resistance is outpacing advances in modern medicine, threatening the health of families worldwide,” WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a Monday statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/-mm-/46ffa7acfb1aa06c1b12a1e01effc5ff0fe17641/c=0-142-2453-1522/local/-/media/2016/05/27/DetroitNews/B99399644Z.1_20160527070610_000_G37V7K45.2-0.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=372&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/-mm-/46ffa7acfb1aa06c1b12a1e01effc5ff0fe17641/c=0-142-2453-1522/local/-/media/2016/05/27/DetroitNews/B99399644Z.1_20160527070610_000_G37V7K45.2-0.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=744&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="This 2006 colorized image from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows a strain of E. coli bacteria.

The reported number of clinical cases of Candida auris — a type of yeast that is resistant to antifungal medications and can spread in health care facilities — increased almost fivefold from 2019 to 2022, the CDC found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"We are so interconnected, and organisms spread very easily," Michigan Chief Medical Executive Natasha Bagdasarian told The Detroit News on Monday. "There are different patterns depending on place, but the (drug-resistant bacteria) are really everywhere. What’s happening on the other side of the globe really impacts us here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;More than 2.8 million antimicrobial-resistant infections occur each year in the United States, according to the CDC, which added that its &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/antimicrobial-resistance/media/pdfs/2019-ar-threats-report-508.pdf" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;2019 report&lt;/a&gt; found that more than 35,000 people die as a result. Antimicrobial-resistant infections were associated with nearly 5 million deaths worldwide in 2019, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2821%2902724-0/fulltext" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;report released in The Lancet medical journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Wayne State researchers have been studying the impacts of drug-resistant bacteria for years, after drug-resistant bacteria were found among Detroit patients, said Dr. Teena Chopra, an assistant dean in the Wayne State School of Medicine, where she is an infectious diseases expert. She and other Wayne State experts have been stressing it is critical to stop the spread of the drug-resistant bacteria, especially in Detroit and southeast Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"It's been getting worse for years now," Chopra said Monday. "Drug resistance is here ... and, given the population of Detroit who are on antibiotics, it's one of the biggest problems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Detroit is one of America's most impoverished big cities, with a majority Black population that has more chronic health conditions. One of the first reported outbreaks of drug-resistant bacteria occurred in Detroit in the early 1980s, involving intravenous drug users and other patients with medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Ghebreyesus warned that doctors around the globe need to use antibiotics responsibly, since an overreliance on antibiotics to treat a variety of ailments has helped lead to the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Our future also depends on strengthening systems to prevent, diagnose and treat infections and on innovating with next-generation antibiotics and rapid point-of-care molecular tests," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Impacts of drug-resistant bacteria&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Detroiters have higher percentages of obesity, diabetes and blood pressure, Chopra said. These conditions require a person to be on antibiotics to treat them, she said. If the antibiotics aren't as effective, people could die of the diseases, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People with other infections, such as those of the bloodstream, urinary tract and gastrointestinal tract, are also at risk of being exposed to drug-resistant bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In its report, the WHO &lt;a&gt;examined worldwide resistance&lt;/a&gt; to 22 antibiotics used to treat common infections. From 2018 to 2023, antibiotic resistance increased an annual average of 5% to 15% in the monitored antibiotics, the report found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The WHO report also looked at eight common bacterial pathogens worldwide, including E. coli and K. pneumoniae, which can lead to severe bloodstream infections that frequently result in sepsis, organ failure and death. The report found that 40% of E. coli infections and 55% of K. pneumoniae infections globally are now resistant to third-generation cephalosporins or a form of antibiotics that includes penicillins, which are the first-choice treatment for these infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The CDC said last month that infections of a type of drug-resistant bacteria called NDM-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-report-finds-sharp-rise-in-dangerous-drug-resistant-bacteria.html" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;have surged more than 460%&lt;/a&gt; in the United States between 2019 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The estimated U.S. cost to treat infections caused by six antimicrobial-resistant germs frequently found in health care is more than $4.6 billion annually, according to a CDC study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Across the world, the WHO report estimated that antibiotic resistance is highest in the South-East Asian and Eastern Mediterranean regions, where 1 in 3 reported infections was resistant. The South-East Asian region covers a quarter of the globe's population, while the Eastern Mediterranean area covers countries such as Afghanistan, Egypt, Tunisia and Pakistan, or about 10% of the world's population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In the African region, 1 in 5 infections was resistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Causes of drug-resistant bacteria&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The increased use and misuse of antibiotics or antimicrobials, along with other stressors, such as pollution, create conditions for microorganisms to develop resistance and bacteria in water, soil and air can become resistant to common antibiotics following contact with resistant microorganisms, the WHO report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"As soon as antibiotics started, bacteria developed to be able to resist them," Michigan's Bagdasarian said. "Now multiple different classes of bacteria can resist them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The exposure to the bacteria can occur through contact with polluted waters, contaminated food, the inhalation of fungal spores, and other pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/presto/2020/12/15/PDTN/b3dc3b83-4623-4c93-a1a4-0fd7d71a06a4-Teena_Chopra_MD_2020_hori.jpg?width=660&amp;amp;height=440&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/presto/2020/12/15/PDTN/b3dc3b83-4623-4c93-a1a4-0fd7d71a06a4-Teena_Chopra_MD_2020_hori.jpg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=880&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Drug-resistant infections have been a problem that has worsened over the decades, said Dr. Teena Chopra, an infectious diseases expert at Wayne State University in Detroit.

People who lack access to doctors are more likely not to seek treatment, which allows the bacteria to become a more serious problem and potentially spread, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;An outbreak of community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus, or a drug-resistant bacterium, was reported as early as 1982 in Detroit, where more than half of the patients were intravenous drug users, and the other half had medical conditions that also put them at risk, according to a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5314345/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;paper by the Infectious Disease Clinics of North America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The proportion of community-acquired staphylococcal infections resistant to methicillin rose from 3% in March 1980 to 38% in September 1981 among 165 patients seen at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, according to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7114629/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;1982 paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. "Drug abuse, serious underlying illness, previous antimicrobial therapy, and previous hospitalization were all associated with the development of this infection," according to the paper's abstract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Other strains of drug-resistant bacterium were also discovered during this outbreak, according to a paper in the National Library of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;What can be done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Although the number of countries reporting bacteria-resistance issues has ballooned fourfold to 104 countries since 2016, almost half of the countries did not report data in 2023, the WHO said. And it warned that about half of the reporting countries still lacked the systems "to generate reliable data."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Generating more reliable data, especially in underserved areas, by 2030 can help inform treatments and policies to fight this public health threat, according to the WHO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For patients, Chopra said, only use antibiotics when prescribed by health care professionals and take all of the prescribed antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But she also pointed to sweeping changes she believes could help slow the rise of the bacteria. Legislation requiring scientists to check for and report the bacteria, worldwide standards on the use of antibiotics for livestock and more federal funding for research to treat the infections would help, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Investments in and creating incentives for the creation of novel antibiotics that bacteria haven't yet formed a resistance to is another solution, Chopra and Bagdasarian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Another solution is antibiotic stewardship, which is already common in most U.S. hospitals, Bagdasarian said. This is a program in which doctors and pharmacists learn the appropriate use of antibiotics to prevent resistance, improve patient outcomes, and preserve antibiotic effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For those suffering from an infection or showing symptoms, such as fever, a headache or fatigue, Chopra suggested seeing a primary care physician as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"The faster we see it, the faster we can treat it," she said. "Any delays in detection could make it harder to treat and cause it to spread."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But this time of year, especially, it's important to make sure patients are being treated for the right condition, Bagdasarian said. Viral infections can't be treated by antibiotics, and using antibiotics to treat respiratory infections will lead to overuse, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"We want to avoid a future where we have bacterial infections that we can’t treat," Bagdasarian said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;satwood@detroitnews.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Detroit News</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 03:01:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi9wFBVV95cUxPclFfRUZZU1c3UHB2Mk85UVZCWURZUkFVaWpMUkp2U2N3NnJzMUZ6UDlNb0dfd2FKRlRrbDFDQktBRDZpR2ZRcVhYUXMyVWFPVnlSVHI4dXVKTFRBRkVySi1rWTBKZ2lmTm9oR0hhU05MZHEtbUhuRnFmaDBqajVrS2V4UWw2bm9KUzhZeDRDUThMTk9rQmxtcEw1SHRSczVuNmFtaVV0MGVydXFJSVBSYUtlUTNOSnNJNkc1YVQ3U2tPcm9aYlg0bmJTOW54ZEg4dDJKYzVoZk5XckROY1RXM2tMSy1xbmlwMTVqSTBVYnZpTUZWMG1B</guid></item><item><title>研究显示，天然甜味剂促进脱发的常见治疗方法- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/natural-sweetener-boosts-a-common-treatment-for-hair-loss-study-reveals</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A leading treatment for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_hair_loss"&gt;androgenetic alopecia&lt;/a&gt; (AGA) – the classic pattern hair loss – could be made more effective with the clever addition of the natural sweetener stevioside, derived from the stevia plant (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevia_rebaudiana"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stevia rebaudiana&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/18238-minoxidil-topical-solution-or-foam"&gt;Minoxidil&lt;/a&gt; is a popular treatment for AGA that is rubbed into the scalp: it works by revitalizing hair follicles with increased blood flow, but not much of it gets absorbed into the skin. Various forms of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2023.126013"&gt;microneedle&lt;/a&gt; patches have been tested to improve penetration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, researchers from China and Australia combined stevioside with microneedle patches, primarily because stevioside helps minoxidil dissolve much better in water. Using this method, much more minoxidil should get under the skin to the hair follicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/decades-of-studies-link-suicide-risk-with-common-hair-loss-treatment"&gt;Decades of Studies Link Suicide Risk With Common Hair Loss Treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach was tested in mice that had been genetically engineered to lose hair, and the results were promising. Much more of the minoxidil made it into the skin, and more hair grew back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a significant increase in hair follicle transition to the growth phase, which resulted in 67.5 percent coverage of the treatment area by day 35," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202503575"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Collectively, the results highlight the potential of the stevioside microneedle delivery system for the treatment of AGA."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_177065" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-177065" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/MouseResults.jpg" alt="Mice baldness" class="wp-image-177065 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/MouseResults.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/MouseResults-512x415.jpg 512w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/MouseResults-600x486.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-177065" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The new treatment significantly improved hair growth in mice. (Zhang et al., &lt;em&gt;Adv. Healthc. Mater.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For mice treated with a standard minoxidil solution, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprise-hair-loss-breakthrough-a-sugar-gel-sparks-robust-regrowth"&gt;hair grew back&lt;/a&gt; in just 25.7 percent of the coverage area by day 35, which is a significant improvement to minoxidil on its own. Hair growth started around a week earlier, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As promising as these results are, they're for mouse hair and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-hair-loss-drug-approved-restores-80-of-hair-loss-in-some-alopecia-patients"&gt;not human hair&lt;/a&gt;. The researchers are still experimenting with the microneedle delivery system and the minoxidil mix to find the best method of delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The benefits and drawbacks of various technical methods, such as metal or soluble microneedles and sustained-release systems, should be evaluated in conjunction with specific clinical scenarios," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202503575"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further testing will be required in larger animal studies before human  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="177062" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; can get underway, and only at that point can scientists assess how these microneedle patches might work on people – while any side effects or other complications can also be weighed up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term viability also needs to be assessed. Current minoxidil treatments need to be applied &lt;a href="https://drhair.co.uk/blog/how-often-should-i-apply-minoxidil/"&gt;at least once a day&lt;/a&gt;, and while microneedle delivery might change that, it needs to be suitable for regular applications.&lt;br&gt;

"Using stevioside to enhance minoxidil delivery represents a promising step toward more effective and natural treatments for hair loss, potentially benefiting millions worldwide," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.wiley.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Can-a-Stevia-derived-sweetener-improve-hair-loss-treatment/default.aspx"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; pharmacologist Lifeng Kang, from the University of Sydney in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202503575"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Advanced Healthcare Materials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

But based on the records gathered, the WHO estimates one in three bacterial infections in south-east Asia and the eastern Mediterranean were resistant to antibiotics in 2023, and one in five in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) arises when pathogens evolve to withstand the drugs used to kill them. In 2021, 7.7 million people globally died from bacterial infections. Drug resistance contributed to 4.71 million of the deaths, with 1.14 million directly attributed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The report raises serious concerns about gram-negative bacteria – those protected by an outer shell – such as &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt;, which cause some of the most severe bacterial infections that often lead to sepsis, organ failure and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Hutin said 40% of &lt;em&gt;E&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; coli&lt;/em&gt; and more than 55% of &lt;em&gt;K&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; are resistant to third-generation cephalosporins, the first choice treatment for such infections. In the WHO African region, resistance often exceeds 70%, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Resistance to critical second-choice antibiotics, particularly carbapenems and fluoroquinolones, was also rising among key gram-negative bacteria such as &lt;em&gt;Acinetobacter&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;K&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; pneumoniae&lt;/em&gt; and salmonella, the report found. “These antibiotics are critical for treating severe infections and their growing ineffectiveness is narrowing the treatment options,” Hutin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Dr Manica Balasegaram at the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership said the report added to evidence that drug-resistant infections had reached “a critical tipping point”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“The most difficult-to-treat gram-negative infections are now beginning to outpace antibiotic development, either because the right antibiotics are not reaching the people who need them, or because they are not being developed in the first place,” he said. “As a result, the number of AMR deaths is &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2824%2901867-1/fulltext" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;now expected to rise sharply&lt;/a&gt;, increasing by 70% by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s not enough to develop new antibiotics, they have to be the right ones, those that target infections that have the greatest public health impact. We are failing to replace the antibiotics that are being lost to resistance, and this latest WHO report shows that the consequences of that are now finally beginning to be felt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Until now, the AMR narrative has focused rightfully on the overuse of antibiotics, but this isn’t enough. To avoid the tipping point, we must now also focus efforts on accelerating innovation and increasing their appropriate use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Prof Sanjib Bhakta, who works on drugs to tackle AMR at University College London, said the WHO report revealed “an alarming escalation in resistance”, particularly among gram-negative bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;He said combating AMR required “tailored global action” from strengthening surveillance and diagnostics to ensuring equitable access to narrow-spectrum antibiotics. Preventing infections was also important through cleaner water, better sanitation and hygiene and vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“Crucially, renewed investment is needed to support interdisciplinary, blue-sky research aimed at discovering novel therapeutic interventions against drug-resistant bacteria,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="d59ac631-67a1-41f5-8764-9ab5f26a9d65" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.GuideAtomBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="GuideAtomWrapper" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props="{&amp;quot;id&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;ea05a110-2f0f-41ea-ba0a-8d9189dbddb7&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Contact us about this story&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;html&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Secure Messaging in the Guardian app&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

While 1.13million Americans are living with HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A preacher talks to drug users in Philadelphia in 2023 as good Samaritans distribute food and warm clothing for those affected by the drug epidemic and homelessness (file image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The US drug epidemic has slowed in recent months, however, amid a crackdown on drug trafficking by the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overdose fatalities have dropped nearly 24 percent over the 12 months to April 2025, the latest available, with an estimated 76,516 fatalities, compared to an estimated 101,363 fatalities over the previous year-long period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is not clear whether bluetoothing is already taking place in the US, but some experts have warned that addicts may be put off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They say that one reason the practice is not more widespread is that it tends to deliver users with a diminished high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It often is not clear how much of a high those who infuse themselves with another drug users blood receive, with this potentially being no different to a placebo effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Catharine Cook, the executive director of Harm Reduction International, a nonprofit based in the UK, told the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/world/asia/bluetoothing-drug-blood-sharing.html"&gt;New York Times:&lt;/a&gt; 'It's the perfect way of spreading HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'&lt;span&gt;It’s a wake-up call for health systems and governments, the speed with which you can end up with a massive spike of infection because of the efficiency of transmission.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Fiji, in 2014 the country had fewer than 500 people living with HIV, but by 2024 this number had surged to approximately 5,900.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the same year, the Pacific island nation recorded 1,583 new cases of HIV, equivalent to a 13-fold increase on its usual five-year average. About half of all new infected patients said they had been sharing needles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows drug overdose deaths by year in the US&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above shows the percent change in drug overdose deaths from April 2024 to April 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Kalesi Volatabu, executive director of the non-profit Drug Free Fiji, described to the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m42dwvlk8o"&gt;BBC &lt;/a&gt;the moment that she witnessed the practice firsthand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I saw the needle with the blood, it was right there in front of me,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This young woman, she'd already had the shot and she's taking out the blood, and then you've got other girls, other adults, already lining up to be hit with this thing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'It's not just needles they're sharing, they're sharing the blood.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Estimates suggest about 33.5 percent of drug users in the US share needles, which also poses a risk of transmitting HIV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts warn that the virus, alongside other diseases such as hepatitis, can get onto the needle if it is used by an infected person, and then be transferred to another individual who also uses the same needle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In general, HIV rates in the US have fallen since 2017. However, due to disruptions in care in 2020 from the Covid pandemic, which means HIV cases were likely missed, new diagnoses have been slightly increased. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the CDC, in the US and its associated territories, there were 39,201 new HIV diagnoses in 2023, the latest data available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is an increase from the 37,721 new cases in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of the 2023 cases, the newest CDC report on HIV shows 518 diagnoses were associated with intravenous drug use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts emphasize that HIV is no longer a death sentence, saying that there are drugs available that can slow the virus' replication and allow someone infected to live a full and normal life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The practice of bluetoothing was first recorded in Tanzania around 2010, where it quickly spread from the country's inner city to the suburbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Zanzibar, a tourism haven in the nation where the practice took hold, researchers found HIV rates were up to 30 times higher than those recorded in the mainland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It has also been recorded in Lesotho, a small African nation bordering South Africa, and Pakistan, where people have sold half-used blood-infused syringes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:27:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPZjdTWGFEZl9iRDlfUlFMQ1dEY2t4Qkw5VEREME52VzZocFlxYXZyWFJpYS1KU19iZDV6SGptUkR6aVQxUjNPQm01dDBjWjhwd01ZdlhPUFhOMUxQT3g2MVZXRTlYMFR3UEpFM1BLamQ2NDBFa1NySXdObEppSkc0dExDb2pQVm5jRmM5VlM4V3Z0MTc4MWdBT1hjQzLSAaIBQVVfeXFMT2ItYXB6YUtORVpkeThycUg3MTRiYS1US3ZjVkY5elF2TkozMmdCYmt6cE9seWJmZTNMOVJkY0dqcm52MzRYMjJENUtJRHhza05HekkxelplVFZRQzU2UVk1R0VfbWVrRjJUYURaYU43MWVDYkhPd0c1TEJmNHRNb2ZmTnZsa3hCUzZZZlA3THRpUENXelJSQ054MnotNWhBN2F3</guid></item><item><title>新的1天手术在同一手术中切除癌症并重建乳房- ABC新闻-突发新闻、最新新闻和视频</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/US/new-1-day-surgery-removes-cancer-reconstructs-breast/story?id=126492962</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;When the results of her routine mammogram came back with a diagnosis of stage 0 DCIS breast cancer in multiple areas of her right breast, Athaliah McPherson, a hairstylist and mom of one, said she wasn’t surprised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I knew something was off," McPherson told ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;McPherson’s diagnosis was not life-threatening in and of itself, but left unchecked, it might have developed into something more serious. Typically, doctors treat DCIS with partial or full breast removal surgery, sometimes followed by radiation or hormone therapy to lower future risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;McPherson was referred to the Montefiore Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;There, her team -- led by Dr. Pedro Piccinini, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon, and Dr. Maureen McEvoy, a breast surgical oncologist -- recommended McPherson undergo a new procedure called total breast reconstruction, which combines mastectomy (breast removal) and reconstruction in a single surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;McPherson recalled that her aunt had been diagnosed with the same type of breast cancer and faced multiple complications after her mastectomy. She was open to an alternative, and six months after her diagnosis, McPherson decided total breast reconstruction was a “no-brainer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Combining the two procedures allows for the removal of breast tissue and rebuilding the breast immediately, instead of doing two separate operations. The surgeon places the breast implants between the chest muscles to provide added stability, helping reduce the risk of distortion, movement, infection and fluid buildup. By avoiding the need to cut through or lift muscle, it can also lessen pain, speed recovery, and create a more natural breast shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="oLzSq QrHMO fnRUo pvsTF EhJPu vPlOC zNYgW OsTsW RMeqy daRVX ISNQ sKyCY eRftA acPPc MENS nFwaT MCnQE mEeeY SmBjI xegrY rPLsU iulOd NIuqO zzscu lzDCc aHUBM IEgzD OjMNy eQqcx SVqKB GQmdz jaoD VWDdR ONJdw vrZxD OnRTz gbbfF roDbV GPGwb oMlSS gfNzt oJhud eXZcf zhVlX "&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="InlineImage GpQCA lZur asrEW " data-testid="prism-inline-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="kzIjN GNmeK pYrtp dSqFO " data-testid="prism-figure"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="nMMea bNYiy Mjgpa dGwha DDmxa jgKNG RGHCC aBIU PriDW lZur " data-testid="prism-caption"&gt;&lt;p class="HXPPJ barbu yKsXL IzgMt VcHIt uhSzI YGNMU cRAsZ xqMcl QtRul "&gt;&lt;span class="hsDdd OOSI GpQCA lZur VlFaz " data-testid="prism-truncate"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="gtOSm FbbUW tUtYa vOCwz EQwFq yCufu eEak Qmvg nyTIa SRXVc vzLa jgBfc WXDas CiUCW kqbG zrdEG txGfn ygKVe BbezD UOtxr CVfpq xijV soGRS XgdC sEIlf daWqJ "&gt;Medical personnel use a mammogram to examine a woman's breast for breast cancer.

That delay often heightens the emotional distress of a breast cancer treatment while the patient waits to regain her breast shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Compared to traditional mastectomy, the immediate impact of total breast reconstruction is, as Piccinini told ABC News, "better results, lower complication rates, shorter hospital stays and reduced overall costs." He added that the procedure is covered by most insurance plans, making it more accessible to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“The first day after surgery, I was up and walking,” McPherson said. “I was back to work within six weeks.” She credits her quick recovery to the ease of the surgery, and active lifestyle, and the care she received at Montefiore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;“I am 100% happy with my results,” McPherson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The two-for-one approach represents a notable shift in breast cancer surgery, said Piccinini. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Improving a patient’s physical appearance after breast cancer treatment can have a powerful ripple effect. Patients often become “more outgoing, experience improved relationships, and develop a stronger self-image,” Piccinini explained. These benefits can contribute to better health outcomes and, in some cases, longer survival, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;McPherson agreed. “Do something that will help you feel better, make you look better, and help you have the will to live,” she advised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Piccinini and his team are presenting their technique to other oncologists at national conferences throughout the country, aiming, he said, to spread the word and advance the standard of care for all breast cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;As for McPherson, she is currently in remission. Her advice to other women: “Do not skip your yearly mammogram.” And if you do get a diagnosis, explore all your options for treatment and recovery, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Cyrus Mowdawalla, MD, is a resident physician in Internal Medicine from Montefiore Medical Center and a contributing correspondent of the ABC News Medical Unit.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>ABC News - Breaking News, Latest News and Videos</author><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 00:01:34 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQbzYxQ3NCZ1lEaW5mZk8zT0IteUx1R2VfU3VwbC02MDlpYTh1ckdBaGFNTzlJazNBWUtYTUl1c19yS2NlZXNteUdBbDQ4cGV4SXV6Z0VSTWN5aDVVTkNUTWlPV2RiMDJmYk5TSHFrbnNjOVFZRGpyanc4c3lacTVNRFVnSGxvbTFLdFhiN05yN2FJVWdNdWFOV0kxdDhIZ9IBowFBVV95cUxQQVZpN2hJWkVPbVhLNzdLMy13UW1UU0dPbkQwNGxYc0t4NXM4US1DTU50UzZDU2dOcEx3Q3JZWC1sQlhjdmhFR2NSSkpubzdfMHRqM09xc0k4SGlaZkxROXprQXpWaW8xdTlVMnNfaGtDcmk3SmVabGFWckZJOVpHbXdqdXVNWnhyT2pNS3dHQnN5dDhfM0JLZmlDcy05bU9LblE4</guid></item><item><title>随着明尼苏达州禽流感的蔓延，杂货商表示，他们预计这不会影响感恩节计划- CBS新闻</title><link>https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minnesota-bird-flu-impact-fall-2025-thanksgiving/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Minnesota is seeing a &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/bird-flu-returns-minnesota-vaccine-turkey-farms/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;resurgence in bird flu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; cases this fall. The virus has infected thousands of turkeys and chickens in eight counties over just the last few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are trying to figure it out, for sure. I tell you, it's so disheartening," said Jake Vlaminck, president of the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vlaminck owns and operates Fahlun Farms near Lake Lillian. When his turkeys first got avian influenza a few years ago, he &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minnesota-farm-bird-flu-laser/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;installed lasers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to keep away ducks and geese —   birds that spread the illness. That seemed to be working until last week, when his father-in-law noticed gulls on the property. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He said he saw them on the roof of the barn. He scared them away. That was on a Monday morning. Come Wednesday morning, our birds started feeling sick," said Vlaminck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Friday, they tested positive for bird flu, and so did one of his neighbors' barns. All the turkeys needed to be put down to stop the spread. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"On the first site, we had to depopulate, it was about 33,000 birds. The other site we depopulated, we are closer to 38,000," said Vlaminck. "Unfortunately, us farmers, we are no better off now than we were 10 years ago."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a consumer standpoint, Thanksgiving is still a month and a half away, but grocery stores don't anticipate this latest outbreak will impact prices or supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Last year they said the same thing and it didn't affect us at all," said Mark Alger, the meat manager at Marketplace Foods in Watertown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a couple of weeks, the first holiday turkeys will start arriving and he's not expecting problems.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've got Butterball. We've got Best Choice, we've got Jennie-O," said Alger. "It's a busy time of the year, the holidays."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It'll also be a busy time for Vlaminck, as he works to get his numbers back up while pushing for a solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The USDA needs to come up with a vaccine strategy and figure out what's the best way to protect all the poultry in the U.S., protect our food supply, and still make sure we can have foreign trade," said Vlaminck. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USDA wants to remind people that turkey bought in grocery stores is safe to eat. &lt;/p&gt;

                                                            &lt;p&gt;A strange affliction is spreading around the internet, infecting celebrities, influencers and civilians alike. Its sufferers are spurned by the medical establishment, scoffed at by disbelievers, spurred into “truther” evangelism and struck down by a torrent of mysterious symptoms for which there is no cure. Sound familiar? No, it’s not long Covid, nor Lyme disease, nor even chronic fatigue syndrome. It’s mould.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent1" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11795499/#:~:text=Abstract,these%20internal%20and%20external%20reviews." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;now-retracted study&lt;/a&gt; by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention linked black mould to infant pulmonary haemorrhage in the Nineties, mould mania has been raging. On TikTok, #toxicmoldillness posts number in the hundreds of millions of views. Reddit is a trove of evacuation diaries: families forced to abandon their mouldy homes, possessions and pets. GoFundMe hosts pages begging us to “Save the Tyler Family from their Toxic Mould Nightmare!” and “Help Kimberly Heal: A Young Woman’s Fight Against Toxic Mould”. And while sufferers appear to span the political spectrum, the crusade has been taken up with particular zeal by the online Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammatory response syndrome, or CIRS, is having a moment. While the condition is not recognised by most medical bodies, true believers report a cascade of symptoms resulting from “mould toxicity” which are oddly evocative of long Covid: neurological impairment, fatigue, respiratory woes, hormonal upset, and so on. Of course, science does accept the pathology of mould: many of us will remember the death of the toddler Awaab Ishak in Rochdale, eight days after his second birthday. Awaab had grown up in a council house filled with black mould, which sent him into respiratory arrest. In the dank houses of rainy England, mould is a real and grave concern. But what mould does not do, as far as the science shows us, is cause CIRS. The &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/damp-and-mould-understanding-and-addressing-the-health-risks-for-rented-housing-providers/understanding-and-addressing-the-health-risks-of-damp-and-mould-in-the-home--2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;British government’s guidance&lt;/a&gt; on mould exposure published in the wake of Awaab’s death lists potentially fatal respiratory illness, irritation or rashes on the eyes and skin — but that is it. Under the heading “mental health effects”, it acknowledges that poor mental health may result from mould but does not concede any psychoactive or neurological effects, rather pointing to “unpleasant living conditions”, “frustration” and “social isolation” as causes. The advice is conservative but clear: the mammoth list of CIRS symptoms are simply not attributable to mould. Likewise the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology offers a robust breakdown of CIRS’s plausibility, &lt;a href="https://www.aaaai.org/tools-for-the-public/conditions-library/allergies/toxic-mold?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;noting&lt;/a&gt; that companies were offering urine-testing kits which were “problematic” and “lacked standardisation”. These are not disinterested parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell that to the internet. Or to the actress &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CsFJnJPvaj8/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Tori Spelling&lt;/a&gt;, who flits in and out of urgent care with children in tow in a “continual spiral of sickness” which she blames on repeated “mould infections”. Or to Brandi Glanville of &lt;em&gt;Real Housewives&lt;/em&gt; infamy, whose bizarre, disfiguring health battle has involved a parasite “&lt;a href="https://www.aol.com/brandi-glanville-spent-70k-treating-175913330.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKa7poqEyrP275T4ehrvotGGUlXvVV4N1mc2IGy8jsIBvnIFr_SFQZNDbTuvPp1oX09NrsYLfI0rJIzZtOv5KkK5P7t8RufybUjmdZNpqVia4wR5EdLkxTKIk6SSZtYqL99zWprQujrY-VFHkEkqQ-qtQ4zASut-Hq13TQNC0aRK" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;moving in her face&lt;/a&gt;” (a more likely explanation, of course, would be a botched plastic surgery job). In one Instagram video, she &lt;a href="https://www.tvinsider.com/1173899/brandi-glanville-health-update-lymphatic-drainage-treatment-face/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;shakes uncontrollably&lt;/a&gt; while undergoing Hollywood-approved lymphatic drainage; in the caption she blames “black mold poisoning from a toxic house we lived in”. Mould mania has even made it to the American Cabinet: RFK Jr., the pseudoscience-swilling health secretary, has linked it to &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/article/rfk-jr-environmental-toxins-autism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; (a typically nuance-crushing claim &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32819265/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;not backed by evidence&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s Chris Williamson, the ex-&lt;em&gt;Love Island&lt;/em&gt; contestant turned life-coaching podcaster who this month released an incredibly unsettling vlog entitled “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IU4D_kjty2k"&gt;It’s Time to Talk About My Health&lt;/a&gt;”. At the time of writing, the video had 1.2 million views. In it, Williamson, a big name in the aspirational masculinity market, describes a time of acute personal crisis: brain fog, loss of libido, emotional numbness and depression. The culprit? “My body was filled with environmental mould.” He lives in hotel rooms, paranoid about fungus lying in wait at home. He endures byzantine testing rituals — waking in the night to breathe into tubes, avoiding light, timing fluids to the ounce — then undergoes increasingly baroque homeopathic procedures because, as one white coat testifies, “traditional allopathic medicine hasn’t caught up”. The vlog culminates in Williamson undergoing a procedure to “clean his blood” in Mexico, completing the cycle from masculine rationalist to raving medieval bloodletter, undone by invisible devils in the body and desperate for physical catharsis. His mouldy manifesto seems to be the final form of the manosphere’s “biohacking” obsession: pain, purification, Sisyphean struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="midcontent2" class="unherd_ad_switch"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the archetypal mould truther is Jordan Peterson, coincidentally a guest on Williamson’s podcast and a star of that same male self-improvement scene. In August, the Canadian psychologist’s daughter, Mikhaila Peterson, announced that her father was “taking time off of everything” due to CIRS, having recently been “exposed to a particularly mouldy environment” while cleaning out his late father’s house. Peterson was said to have been “near death”, spending “almost a month in the ICU”; the mould was to blame for “cancelled shows, cancelled events, sporadic appearance of being run down and general weepiness”. Peterson had been battling CIRS since 2017, she said. But the case was not straightforward; it was not even the first time Mikhaila was announcing that her father had been close to death. In 2020 she told the world how he’d been debilitated by a separate struggle, this time with benzodiazepine withdrawal. Five years later, an invisible enemy had clawed him back to despair. Peterson’s case is murky and unusual — but Mikhaila’s account did not acknowledge these complicating factors: “The fact that doctors don’t generally recognise that mould exposure in indoor air is causing chronic health issues is insane,” she wrote. Fungus was also the key factor in “our food sensitivities and inability to tolerate anything other than meat” (she and her father both live on an all-meat diet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not anyone’s place to argue with someone who says they are ill; many of those in the “mouldie” community (self-christened, may I add) are likely to be genuinely unwell, just not in the way they think. In our anti-scientific climate, advice from bodies such as the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mold-health/about/index.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt; is being degraded by chronic and poisonous scepticism. CIRS did not spring from nowhere: it thrived in the cracks of the public square over years of populist feeling. What CIRS really represents is paranoia, distrust, and a fatal lack of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diagnosis is, by no coincidence, also a metaphor for the Peterson mythos. He himself is the archetypal internet patriarch — a proponent of self-discipline, wary of pollution both moral and cultural, laid low by spores in the walls. His family sees this illness as both biochemical and “spiritual” (Mikhaila’s words); it represents an establishment sickness that ignores the little guy and abandons him to splutter his last. But the entire diagnosis rests on contested laboratory markers and anecdotal recovery stories, and the interventions of practitioners who are financially incentivised to keep patients’ paranoia alive. As in all health panics, empirical weakness is rhetorical strength. If the experts deny it, that only proves the conspiracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="su-pullquote su-pullquote-align-left"&gt;“The diagnosis is a metaphor for the Peterson mythos.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frankly, the cult of CIRS has driven “mouldies” mad. Two sufferers who were interviewed for an article in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/people-afraid-of-toxic-mold.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Cut&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; come across as hypervigilant exiles: one, a woman from Florida, says: “My nose is like a detector of mould. I smell it in almost every house I go to.” A Maryland man says: “There’s actually thousands of us who are living in their vehicles or RVs or tents.” This life-wrecking paranoia is what CIRS is all about: not being believed, fighting an enemy you cannot see but that you insist is there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that same article, &lt;em&gt;The Cut&lt;/em&gt; describes online forums where users trade reports of “mould rage” — sudden mood swings and the surfacing of harrowing repressed memories blamed on spores in the vents. As with any contested condition, there remains a basis of scientific truth: mould can make you hallucinate. Ergot, the fungus from which LSD is derived, does so when ingested. In the Middle Ages, grain infected with this could, when baked into bread, send entire villages into delirium (the condition was known as &lt;a href="https://www.ejog.org/article/0028-2243(95)02104-Z/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;St Anthony’s Fire&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;em&gt;Uncanny&lt;/em&gt;, the BBC’s podcast about hauntings, recently featured a case in which a young man believed that a ghost was helping him wash his hair in the shower; the resident paranormal sceptic suggested that the mildew in his flat may have triggered visions. Under real-world conditions, simply breathing in mould would not provide a sufficient dose to cause delirium: &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39162373/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;stress, anxiety, depression&lt;/a&gt;, sure, but not the neurological effects (brain fog, dementia etc) described by CIRS. For many, the link is nonetheless powerful and evocative: the spore stands in for entropy, psychic seepage. One of the internet’s favourite in-jokes is that the writer and women’s rights campaigner J.K. Rowling has been “turned evil” by black mould which appeared, in one photograph of her living room, to be growing on the walls; “her &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenAndPleasant/comments/1eg1p6e/jk_rowling_posts_selfie_revealing_her_mansion_is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;TERF brain worms&lt;/a&gt; may be caused by fungal spores,” writes one snivelling Redditor. Of course, what looked to be a spreading infestation was actually just &lt;a href="https://x.com/idolomantiss/status/1820962747070263451" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;an unusual wallpaper&lt;/a&gt;; but the creeping corruption of mould is a far more compelling story than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The allure of CIRS lies both in its metaphorical power — the idea of hidden toxicity everywhere — and its simplicity: if you can name the mould, you can kill it. The problem is that depending on quack procedures which claim to remove fungus from the blood is unmoored from science and reality and will not help these people, many of whom evidently need some sort of intervention — medical or otherwise. It was just weeks ago that the Right &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPFhFG0jA_R/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;was ridiculing&lt;/a&gt; the snowflake nepo baby Violet Affleck for telling the UN that everyone should be wearing masks, and that politicians were stealing young people’s future by allowing the pernicious spread of long Covid. Long Covid is also the subject of a culture war, fuzzily understood and probably commonly misidentified, but compared to CIRS it at least holds water as a diagnosis. If we really do have a mould problem, it’s that “mouldies” themselves represent a creeping degradation of science and trust in establishments, the inner rot of fact-free paranoia which is yanking us back to the Dark Ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would you do if you discovered your name in a list of experts on sex robots despite having never studied sex robots? &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That was the situation for one rather panicked researcher who reached out to us in late September after discovering his name among several singled out in a review article for the “greatest number of published works” on sex robots. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Published in February in &lt;em&gt;Humanities and Social Sciences Communications&lt;/em&gt;, the bibliometric analysis of the field aimed “to provide a clearer understanding of the issues surrounding sex robots,” the original article stated. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-133090"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The article included a list of the 10 authors who the paper claimed published the most articles on sex robot research. Of those, seven are robotics researchers who don’t study sex robots. The remaining three are a cardiologist, a prosthodontics professor and a researcher who we could not find proof exists. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researcher who contacted us was keen to get the paper, which he called “defamatory,” retracted. While we typically prefer to name sources, and credit any investigative work, we’re honoring his desire to distance himself from the paper and are therefore omitting his name — and the identities of the others named in the article — from our story so as not to increase the chances a search or AI tool will forever associate his name with “sex robots.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researcher first alerted &lt;em&gt;HHSC&lt;/em&gt; to issues with the paper in late September, according to emails we have seen. The journal, published by Springer Nature, temporarily &lt;a href="https://archive.is/BCq4H"&gt;took the article page down&lt;/a&gt; on September 26. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Given the context, access to the paper was removed as soon as we had undertaken an initial assessment,” Gino D’Oca, the chief editor of &lt;em&gt;HHSC&lt;/em&gt;, told us. In a similar move earlier this year, Springer Nature &lt;a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/07/16/springer-nature-to-retract-machine-learning-book-following-retraction-watch-coverage/"&gt;removed a link&lt;/a&gt; to a book containing nonexistent references before restoring a retracted and watermarked version days later. The publisher confirmed at the time that removal from the website is part of the retraction process. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the issues the researcher identified were discrepancies between the dataset, which contains a list of over 1,000 papers from journals indexed in Web of Science, and the authors’ claims. For example, the authors said &lt;em&gt;IEEE Transactions on Robotics&lt;/em&gt; had published 30 papers on sex robots. Our search of the journal yielded no results, and the researcher who contacted us said the journal appeared just once in the authors’ dataset. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researcher who contacted us had also reached out to someone who does study sex robots, who “confirmed that the paper is fake,” he said. Both researchers, and at least five others, contacted the journal directly to request the retraction, according to a document we have seen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The journal issued a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-06061-7"&gt;retraction notice&lt;/a&gt; on October 7, stating the analysis “employed inappropriate search terms and formulas, affecting the resulting reported data on the research field, including individual authors and journals.” The text of the original article &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-025-04430-w"&gt;has been removed&lt;/a&gt; from both the website and the PDF.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;D’Oca told us &lt;em&gt;HHSC &lt;/em&gt;is looking into other work by one of the corresponding authors, &lt;a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6900-8831"&gt;Shen Liu&lt;/a&gt;. Liu is a psychology researcher at Anhui Agricultural University in Hefei, China, who authored  &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02665-7"&gt;another paper&lt;/a&gt; in the journal  purporting to use the &lt;a href="https://rec.ustc.edu.cn/share/0d874150-b039-11ee-be97-f5a41b2eeb6e"&gt;same&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/UMDR3Y"&gt;dataset&lt;/a&gt; as the now-retracted article. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Neither Liu nor co-corresponding author Na Zhang, also at Anhui, responded to our multiple requests for comment via email. The authors agreed with the retraction, according to the notice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other issues we spotted include a network analysis of authors that includes three “brought together by their mutual focus on robot-assisted radical cystectomy,” and others who perform nephrectomies. While these bladder and kidney surgeries are robot-assisted, they are unrelated to sex robots. The review also cites at least one work that does not exist and whose only other mention is in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-02665-7"&gt;another article&lt;/a&gt; by Liu. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For their analysis of journals publishing sex robot research, the authors use the term “Influential Factor (IF)” instead of “Impact Factor,” describing the term as a “paramount metric for evaluating scholarly impact.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The paper has been cited once, according to Clarivate’s Web of Science. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S.A.D. is a common seasonal ailment that can make people feel depressed, irritated, and less sociable. For some, it can potentially exacerbate existing mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I personally struggle with seasonal depression," said Rosie Kuska, The Sober Life's peer-recovery coach and care coordinator. "Right around the time that the sun starts to hide, you can just almost feel it in the air."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Kuska, when the cold comes in, individuals tend to retreat, stay at home, and revert to unhealthy behaviors such as substance abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was like, oh my gosh, I'm sad. I don't want to leave my house. And on top of that, I just really want to get high because that's what I'm used to," she explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Kojetin and Kuska agree that overcoming seasonal sadness frequently requires doing the opposite of what feels natural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If we don't have enough sunlight exposure—which is the case here—then we want to expose ourselves to sunlight," according to Kojetin. "Taking care of yourself like you would a plant—making sure you have nutrients, water, and sunlight—is very important."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even minor acts, such as raising the curtains, taking brief trips outside, or spending time in bright indoor places, can assist in regulating the body's chemical balance. Maintaining an active and social lifestyle can also help improve mood and energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do fitness activities seven days a week," Kuska stated. "We have Zumba, volleyball, basketball—something for literally everyone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people in Great Falls find that being connected—whether through exercise, community events, or outdoor recreation—can make a big difference throughout Montana's long winters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying proactive, engaged, and taking care of oneself is crucial for navigating the season.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

More &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/constipation/symptoms-causes" target="_blank"&gt;serious symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of constipation include blood in stool, fever and vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7854d4" class="body-graf"&gt;Constipation can be caused by diet, lifestyle, certain illnesses and injuries, and some medications. It’s &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4059-constipation" target="_blank"&gt;extremely common&lt;/a&gt;, affecting people of all ages, gender and race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-66f5d3" class="body-graf"&gt;“I see chronic constipation across the spectrum,” said Sue-Ellen Anderson-Haynes, a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. “I see it in toddlers, I see it in school-age children, I see it in adults. So it’s a common thing,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b42c3a" class="body-graf"&gt;Chronic constipation can &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5976340/" target="_blank"&gt;severely impact&lt;/a&gt; people’s lives and limit their physical abilities, worsening their &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11532788/#jgh370042-sec-0020" target="_blank"&gt;quality of life and work productivity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a1d5ee" class="body-graf"&gt;“If you’re chronically constipated, you may not be able to even participate in physical activity, because you feel bloated, you’re in pain, you’re achy, it may affect your mood,” said Anderson-Haynes, who also owns 360 Girls and Women, a nutrition and health practice based in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-183804" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is chronic constipation treated?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cfe66e" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. William Chey, professor of gastroenterology at the University of Michigan and incoming president of the American College of Gastroenterology, said most studies on treating chronic constipation have focused on fiber supplements, like psyllium, and medications, like bisacodyl, senna and amitiza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e44c9f" class="body-graf"&gt;He added American guidelines “focus pretty heavily on medical therapies for chronic constipation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e42409" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://gi.org/topics/constipation-and-defection-problems/" target="_blank"&gt;Traditional constipation treatments&lt;/a&gt; include increasing fiber intake through foods like prunes and other fruits and vegetables, drinking more water, and using different kinds of laxatives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-991acc" class="body-graf"&gt;While the new guidelines include certain fiber-rich foods and fiber supplements, there’s no guidance on a “high-fiber diet” overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1e9420" class="body-graf"&gt;“When we were building these guidelines, and looking at the literature, we were expecting a lot more evidence on a high-fiber diet, and there simply isn’t enough in constipation,” Dimidi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7c2955" class="body-graf"&gt;“There’s plenty of evidence that a high-fiber diet is very beneficial for our overall health and also for elements of gut health, such as reducing the risk of colorectal cancer,” she added. “But when it comes to constipation, specifically, we just don’t have enough evidence to say that it improves constipation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anchor-d8156f" class="body-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the new recommendations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-94ace4" class="body-graf"&gt;Chey, who wasn’t involved with the new guidelines, said the recommendations “provide a valuable road map to things that [people] can try as they’re waiting to see their primary care physician.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e07c0b" class="body-graf"&gt;He added that people with more severe cases of constipation may need to see a gastroenterologist. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-5476a9" class="body-graf"&gt;The recommendations include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul id="anchor-a0beb2" class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fiber supplements: More than 10 grams of fiber supplements, such as psyllium, per day can improve stool frequency and consistency and aid in reducing straining. Fiber supplements should be slowly introduced and dosage gradually increased.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Probiotics: Certain strains of probiotics, including, &lt;em&gt;B. lactis&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bacillus coagulans&lt;/em&gt; Unique IS2, may help some people with symptoms. If taking one, patients should take a supplement of their choice and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for at least four weeks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Magnesium oxide supplements: 0.5-1.5 grams daily can help with stool frequency and consistency, reduce symptoms such as bloating and abdominal pain and improve overall quality of life. Dosage should start at 0.5 grams per day and be gradually increased weekly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kiwis: Three daily, with or without the skin, can help improve stool frequency but not consistency.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rye bread: Six to eight slices of rye bread per day can also aid stool frequency, but not consistency. The authors noted that this amount may not be realistic for some people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;High mineral-content water: In combination with other treatments, 0.5-1.5 liters per day of high mineral-content water may also help. One of the key minerals in high mineral-content water, magnesium, is a known laxative. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cc9cdb" class="body-graf"&gt;The one recommendation that gives Chey pause is for probiotics. “People’s microbiomes ... vary a lot from location to location based on diet, based on genetics, based on the environment, and so it’s very hard to make any generalizable statements about the use of specific probiotics,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-488116" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, overall, he said, “I think these kinds of recommendations are going to be very helpful.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d3d2a9" class="body-graf"&gt;Dimidi said she hopes the release of the guidelines can “empower” those with chronic constipation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-25ea91" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“We’re hoping [the guidance] means that clinicians are very well-informed and can provide personalized advice to their patients that is very effective,” she said. “But also that people themselves with constipation can access now evidence-based information, feel empowered to take control of the symptoms and improve a condition that has a tremendous impact on quality of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 21:12:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPUTBOTnVzMlZaZ3hadHBZYWZVbzRoZnRyMC1sSVE5MDRMTU1FVk5STjhVYTNqQjlGMUJIYzNaNE1xSVRjOWdMUW1VdEYzUjlRMG56SGVhSEZCNUd3Y2VTeDFZOWp6OFRfS2JOVzFseDJoSV93UlJJOXZZckNJaUJXbkdDM2R0VHk0MnAwcmdTVGpTUFNmX1Q1ZEpJejBfRFB5NnFxX3JFSmhWRGN00gFWQVVfeXFMTTltVU5SQ2JVdDc2RUFWQlR3TE5ZMS10V0FacFcySTkxc0ZmRTZtOWtGRm1FdDVDV0ZiZXJ6UmEydGVmTWtNeFVzbXlla2tvTnR0bnI5dGc</guid></item><item><title>科学家终于发现了长期新冠肺炎最致命的症状背后的原因--男性健康</title><link>https://www.menshealth.com/health/a69020230/long-covid-brain-fog-cause-study-oct-2025/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-journey-body="standard-article" class="article-body-content article-body standard-body-content css-n3hm4j et2g3wt7"&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="0" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="0.0"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="0.1"&gt;REMEMBER COVID?

For years, researchers have tried to uncover the mystery behind this debilitating symptom. And &lt;em data-node-id="1.5"&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; we have some answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="2" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article/7/5/fcaf337/8258475" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article/7/5/fcaf337/8258475" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="study" data-node-id="2.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="2.1.0"&gt;study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em data-node-id="2.3"&gt;Brain Communications&lt;/em&gt; earlier this month pinpoints the first biological evidence to explain why long COVID brain fog happens, and potentially provides a new target for treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The study identified changes in a type of receptor in the brain called AMPA, which help brain cells communicate with each other and are important in connections related to memory and learning. Changes in AMPA receptor activity have been previously associated with &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a68998780/depression-symptoms-heart-disease-diabetes-risk/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a68998780/depression-symptoms-heart-disease-diabetes-risk/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="depression" data-node-id="4.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="4.1.0"&gt;depression&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a60755629/this-is-what-having-schizophrenia-is-really-like/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a60755629/this-is-what-having-schizophrenia-is-really-like/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="schizophrenia" data-node-id="4.3" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="4.3.0"&gt;schizophrenia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and dementia.&lt;br data-node-id="4.5"&gt;&lt;br data-node-id="4.6"&gt;Since people with brain fog have trouble processing and remembering information, the researchers of the new study hypothesized that &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a45101133/how-long-does-covid-last/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a45101133/how-long-does-covid-last/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="COVID" data-node-id="4.8" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="4.8.0"&gt;COVID&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; may have disrupted AMPA receptor activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="5" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;The team used a new type of PET imaging brain scans to examine the number of AMPA receptors in living human brains of 30 people with long COVID. They compared their brain scans to 80 individuals without long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="6" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Amongst people with long COVID, there was an abnormally high density of AMPA receptors. And the more AMPA receptor activity there was, the more severe people reported their cognitive impairments.&lt;br data-node-id="6.1"&gt;&lt;br data-node-id="6.2"&gt;“This is a potentially promising study that raises an interesting hypothesis about a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment ("brain fog"). The specific receptor (AMPA) seems to be upregulated in this small cohort of patients who have brain fog, and normal in healthy controls,” says &lt;a href="https://www.osfhealthcare.org/providers/deepak-nair-1464703" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.osfhealthcare.org/providers/deepak-nair-1464703" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Deepak Nair, MD" data-node-id="6.4" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="6.4.0"&gt;Deepak Nair, MD&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at OSF Healthcare in Illinois who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Increases in AMPA activity is only one half of the story. The other half is something researchers have long suspected—that COVID infections provoke an overactive brain &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a38771689/immune-system-strong/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a38771689/immune-system-strong/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="immune response" data-node-id="7.1" class="body-link css-1d8p8n5 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="7.1.0"&gt;immune response&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="8" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;In the study, they found several inflammatory markers linked to increases in AMPA receptor levels. According to the researchers, the immune response may be behind these changes in AMPA receptor numbers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-6wxqfj emevuu60"&gt;Keep in mind, this new study is in its early phases. Dr. Nair notes it would have been helpful to know if the control group—people who did not have long COVID—had prior COVID infections and how that might have affected the results.

          &lt;p&gt;Health officials in South Carolina are warning that the highly infectious measles virus is spreading undetected in communities in the northern part of the state, specifically Spartanburg and Greenville counties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, officials in Greenville identified an eighth measles case that is potentially linked to the outbreak. Seven outbreak cases had been confirmed since September 25 in neighboring Spartanburg, where transmission was identified in two schools: Fairforest Elementary and Global Academy, a public charter school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across those two schools, at least 153 unvaccinated children were exposed to the virus and have been put in a 21-day quarantine, during which they are barred from attending school, state officials said in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baOoDM-Bn2g"&gt;a press conference&lt;/a&gt;. Twenty-one days is the maximum incubation period, spanning from when a person is exposed to when they would develop a rash if infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's unclear how the latest case in Greenville became infected with the virus and how they may link to the nearby Spartanburg cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What this case tells us is that there is active, unrecognized community transmission of measles occurring in the Upstate [northern region of South Carolina], which makes it vital to ensure that the public have received their measles vaccinations," the South Carolina Department of Public Health said in &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/news/dph-confirms-states-11th-measles-case-greenville-county-eighth-related-current-outbreak"&gt;an announcement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two recommended doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine are about 97 percent effective at blocking the infection, and that protection is considered lifelong. Without that protection, the virus is extremely contagious, infecting 90 percent of unvaccinated people who are exposed. The virus spreads easily through the air, lingering in the airspace of a room for up to two hours after an infected person has left.&lt;/p&gt;

In the final step, the contestant is asked whether they want to change their mind and select the remaining option A or stick with their original choice, B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dubbed the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem"&gt;Monty Hall problem&lt;/a&gt; after an American game show host, this famous puzzle has entertained mathematicians for decades. But it can also tell us something about how the human mind and brain function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do some people choose to change their minds while others stick with their first choice? What would you do and what might your choice reveal about your mind?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Choosing when to change&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research on changes of mind uses the concept of “metacognition” to explain when and how mind changes occur. Broadly speaking, metacognition refers to psychological and biological processes that inform us about how well we are doing the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a sense, metacognition is that inner voice telling us we are either on track or that we should try harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intuitively, changes of mind may be triggered by low confidence in our initial choice. Yet, when my colleagues and I &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2022.02.004"&gt;reviewed the research&lt;/a&gt; on changes of mind about a range of different kinds of decisions, we found many studies showing people change their minds less often than you might think. This was surprising, given how often we feel uncertain about our choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, when people do choose to change their mind, it is often &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhae179"&gt;for the better&lt;/a&gt;. This ability to accurately gauge whether to change your mind is referred to as metacognitive sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research has found people often &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-07646-3"&gt;make better decisions&lt;/a&gt; about whether to change their minds when they are put under time pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding more about how we decide to change our minds may lead to ways to train our minds to make better choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Our brains show when we will change our minds&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another interesting question about changes of mind is &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; do people choose to change their minds. The answer to this question might seem obvious, as people can change their minds only after they have made the first choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find out more about this process, we measured people’s brain activity before they even made their initial choice in a laboratory task that involved answering questions about moving images on a screen. We successfully &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhae179"&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; changes of mind seconds &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-025-07646-3"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; they took place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest brain activity that predicts changes of mind could be harnessed to improve the quality of the initial choices, without needing a change of mind later. Training based on this brain activity may help people in sensitive professions such as health or defence make better choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why don’t we change our minds more often?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research on metacognition has provided robust evidence that changes of mind tend to improve choice outcomes. So why are people so reluctant to change their minds?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are at least two possible reasons. First, deciding to change your mind is typically a result of making extra cognitive effort to analyse the quality of the initial choices. Not every decision requires that effort, and most everyday choices can be good enough rather than perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, choosing a wrong brand of orange-flavoured soft drink will probably not significantly impact our wellbeing. In fact, consumer research shows buyers tend to report higher product satisfaction when offered fewer choices, a phenomenon called “&lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470939338.ch6"&gt;the paradox of choice&lt;/a&gt;”. This suggests having more choices and, therefore, greater opportunity to change one’s mind may be more cognitively effortful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, frequent changes of mind may signal personality traits that are not socially desirable. Meaningful and fulfilling interpersonal relationships rely on the ability to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2005.12.126"&gt;predict and rely on&lt;/a&gt; another person’s actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erratic and frequent changes of mind could negatively impact relationships and people may avoid doing this to improve their social integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The future of changing your mind&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The science of changes of mind is an exciting field of research, developing at a fast pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future developments in the field might focus on identifying specific brain activity markers of subsequent correct changes of mind. If reliable and valid markers are found, they could be harnessed to help people become experts on when they should change their minds to achieve better professional and social outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and coming back to the Monty Hall problem: if you ever do find yourself offered this choice by a game show host, you should definitely change your mind. In this scenario, for mathematical reasons, switching away from your first pick will &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/the-monty-hall-problem-going-with-your-gut-will-get-your-goat-14195"&gt;double your chances of winning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263907/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263907/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

When people tap along to sound, slow rhythmic brain waves align with the perceived beat, helping maintain steady timing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, with rhythmic vibration, the brain responds to each pulse individually, failing to generate the same beat-like neural patterns. These findings highlight why music’s rhythm is such a powerful auditory experience — and why touch alone can’t quite make us dance in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Auditory Advantage:&lt;/strong&gt; The brain’s slow rhythmic activity locks onto the beat when music is heard but not when it’s felt through vibration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less Precision Through Touch:&lt;/strong&gt; People tapped less steadily when following tactile rhythms compared to auditory ones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music and the Mind:&lt;/strong&gt; Beat synchronization may be central to the social and emotional power of music.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do people keep the beat to music?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When people listen to songs, slow waves of activity in the brain correspond to the perceived beat so that they can tap their feet, nod their heads, or dance along. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt; paper, researchers led by Cédric Lenoir, from Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain), explored whether this ability is unique to hearing or whether it also happens when rhythm is delivered by touch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recorded brain activity as study volunteers finger tapped to the beat of music delivered via sound or rhythmic vibration. With sound, the brain generated slow rhythmic fluctuations that matched the perceived beat, and people tapped along to the rhythm more steadily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, with touch, the brain mainly tracked each burst of vibrations one by one, without creating the same beat-like fluctuations, and people were less precise in the way they synchronized with the rhythm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Says Lenoir, “The ability to move in time with a beat is essential for human social interactions through music. Future research will help clarify whether long-term music practice can strengthen the brain’s ability to process rhythm through other senses, or whether sensory loss, such as hearing impairment, might allow the sense of touch to take over part of this function.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Questions Answered:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1760384048628"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: How does the brain track the beat of music?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: When we listen to music, slow neural oscillations in the brain align with the beat, allowing us to move rhythmically and stay in time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1760384064194"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: Does the same happen when we feel rhythm through touch?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Not quite. The brain responds to each vibration separately instead of forming an overall sense of beat, making synchronization less precise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="schema-faq-section" id="faq-question-1760384079610"&gt;&lt;strong class="schema-faq-question"&gt;Q: What are the broader implications of this discovery?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p class="schema-faq-answer"&gt;A: Understanding how different senses process rhythm could inform music therapy, hearing research, and sensory rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this auditory neuroscience and tactile perception research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a5c8c0c1ccc4e5d6c3cb8bcad7c2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN Media&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://sfn.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;SfN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;SfN Media – SfN&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0664-25.2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Behavior-relevant periodized neural representation of acoustic but not tactile rhythm in humans&lt;/a&gt;” by Cédric Lenoir et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavior-relevant periodized neural representation of acoustic but not tactile rhythm in humans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music makes people move. This human propensity to coordinate movement with musical rhythm requires multiscale temporal integration, allowing fast sensory events composing rhythmic input to be mapped onto slower, behavior-relevant, internal templates such as periodic beats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, beat perception has been shown to involve an enhanced representation of the beat periodicities in neural activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the extent to which this ability to move to the beat, and the related &lt;em&gt;periodized&lt;/em&gt; neural representation, are shared across the senses beyond audition remains unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we addressed this question by recording separately the electroencephalographic responses (EEG) and finger tapping to a rhythm conveyed either through acoustic or tactile inputs in healthy volunteers of either sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EEG responses to the acoustic rhythm, spanning a low-frequency range (below 15 Hz), showed enhanced representation of the perceived periodic beat, compatible with behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the EEG responses to the tactile rhythm, spanning a broader frequency range (up to 25 Hz), did not show significant beat-related periodization, and yielded less stable tapping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these findings suggest a preferential role of low-frequency neural activity in supporting neural representation of the beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, we show that this neural representation, as well as the ability to move to the beat, is not systematically shared across the senses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More generally, these results, highlighting multimodal differences in beat processing, reveal a process of multiscale temporal integration that allows the auditory system to go beyond mere tracking of onset timing and to support higher-level internal representation and motor entrainment to rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 19:38:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE9XZ29VNHFucnhfcG1GNnNROVNvMXBHMjBvZlFrUUpVaUt1el9CR0JUYmhDeWNOSmVoMkRyVnVYWFlIZHc3YlUwa3cwdUVIRzluOFBtS1MwRXZaZDJ2d0cxNTEyWmhiWjZrak1SU0pnMEgwZUJXLWsyNVV3</guid></item><item><title>靶向酶以削弱癌细胞可以增强前列腺癌治疗- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2025-10-enzymes-weaken-cancer-cells-supercharge.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="mt-4 article-main"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;An international study has uncovered a new vulnerability in prostate cancer cells that could help improve treatment for one of the most common cancers affecting men.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The research, published in the journal &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/i&gt; , was led by scientists from Flinders University in Australia and South China University of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reveals that two enzymes—PDIA1 and PDIA5—play a crucial role in helping prostate cancer cells grow, survive, and resist treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These enzymes act as molecular bodyguards for the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/androgen+receptor/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;androgen receptor&lt;/a&gt; (AR), a protein that fuels prostate cancer. When PDIA1 and PDIA5 are blocked, the AR becomes unstable and breaks down, leading to cancer cell death and tumor shrinkage in both lab-grown cells and animal models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also found that combining drugs that block PDIA1 and PDIA5 with enzalutamide, a widely used prostate cancer medication, significantly boosted the treatment's effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We've discovered a previously unknown mechanism that &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/prostate+cancer+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;prostate cancer cells&lt;/a&gt; use to protect the androgen receptor, which is a key driver of the disease," says senior author, Professor Luke Selth, Head of Prostate Cancer Research and Co-Director of Flinders Health and Medical Research Institute's Cancer Impact program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By targeting these enzymes, we can destabilize the AR and make tumors more vulnerable to existing therapies like enzalutamide."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead author, Professor Jianling Xie, who started the research while at Flinders University, says that this &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/combination+therapy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;combination therapy&lt;/a&gt; worked well in patient-derived tumor samples and in mice, suggesting strong potential for future clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;"This is an exciting step forward," says Dr. Xie, now at South China University of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our findings show that PDIA1 and PDIA5 are not just helpers of cancer growth but they're also promising targets for new treatments that could work alongside existing drugs."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the role of these enzymes goes beyond protecting the AR. The study found that PDIA1 and PDIA5 also help cancer cells manage stress and maintain &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/energy+production/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;energy production&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blocking them causes damage to the cells' mitochondria—the parts of the cell that generate energy—and leads to oxidative stress, which further weakens the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This dual impact of hitting both the AR and the cancer's energy supply makes these enzymes especially attractive targets," adds Dr. Xie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's like cutting off both the fuel and the engine at the same time."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Selth adds that while current drugs that block PDIA1 and PDIA5 show promise, more work is needed to make them safe and effective for use in patients. Some of the existing compounds may affect &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/healthy+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;healthy cells&lt;/a&gt;, so future studies will focus on developing safer inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide. Although treatments like &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hormone+therapy/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;hormone therapy&lt;/a&gt; and AR-targeting drugs have helped many patients, resistance to these therapies is a major challenge. This new discovery could help overcome that hurdle and improve outcomes for men with advanced prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;Before the pandemic helped fuel the growth of vaccine politicization across the country, less than 1% of Austin school district’s kindergarteners in the fall of 2019 failed to comply with the state’s vaccine reporting requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years later, the Austin Independent School District had some of the state’s highest number of kindergarteners who neglected those state requirements — about 1 in 5 kindergarteners had not proven they were fully vaccinated against measles and did not file an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Texas Tribune analysis has found that this explosion of vaccine non-compliance has played out across many school districts in the state in recent years, helping to push Texas’ measles vaccine coverage to the lowest it’s been since at least 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We definitely were on a better trajectory (before the pandemic),” said Alana Bejarano, executive director of health services and nursing for the Austin school district, which reported a 23% delinquency rate for the measles vaccines among their kindergarteners.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know that I can pinpoint the concrete answer, except (preschool and kindergarteners) were born at a time where everything kind of went off track and getting them back into that, you know, that’s been difficult.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Tribune examined kindergarten measles vaccination compliance because it’s the earliest the state documents school vaccination rates and measles can be especially deadly for young children. The state’s two measles deaths this year were girls ages 6 and 8. Under Texas vaccine requirements, most kindergarteners must show they are fully vaccinated against measles or file an exemption to enroll in school; most who are not fully vaccinated have an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;During the pandemic, the statewide measles vaccine delinquency rate — a term the Texas Department of State Health Services uses to track students not compliant with those requirements — more than doubled.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The Tribune estimated the number of vaccine-delinquent kindergarteners in each district by comparing delinquency rates and enrollment totals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In school districts with the most delinquent kindergarteners in the 2024-25 school year, the latest data available from the state, as much as 44% of their kindergarteners were delinquent in the measles vaccines, and their delinquencies also outnumbered exemptions, which was not the case at the state level. Those school districts had vaccine delinquency rates as small as a fraction of a percent just five years prior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five other vaccinations required for kindergarten followed similar increases in delinquency rates during the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pandemic is the driving force behind the increase in vaccine delinquency, school district officials say. Many children are entering school after falling behind on their immunizations during the pandemic, making it an untenable task for resource-strapped school districts to chase after parents to vaccinate their children or submit an exemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, access to vaccines, especially free and low-cost doses, have also dwindled over the last several years amid funding cuts and the politicization of vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;State laws and rules don’t dictate who has to enforce vaccine compliance, although the Texas Department of State Health Services administers the law and school districts have traditionally been among the first line of enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While school districts acknowledge they are enrolling students not compliant with state vaccine requirements, district officials say they are caught in a no-win situation. Pushing vaccines too hard could lead to retaliation from groups and politicians opposed to vaccine mandates, and district officials don’t want to disenroll students — public schools have a responsibility to educate all children and so much of their funding is tied to attendance, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We encourage our school nurses to advocate strongly to promote and protect public health at their campus,” Becca Harkleroad, executive director of the Texas School Nurse Organization. “But ultimately it’s up to the superintendent and the principal to decide how strictly they are going to enforce it or if they are going to enforce it.”&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;Statewide, the percentage of kindergarteners who were delinquent in getting the measles vaccine more than doubled to 2.68% between 2019-20 and 2024-25, the latest data available. The delinquency rate jumped to 3.1% in 2021-22, surpassing the number of students who had an exemption. Those rates have not returned to pre-pandemic levels, although the exemption rate has returned to exceeding the delinquency rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that a year ago 25,000 Texas kindergarteners were not fully vaccinated against measles. Of those, more than 16,000 had an exemption, and about 9,000 did not have an exemption and under the state’s definition, were vaccine delinquent.&lt;/p&gt;
    
&lt;p&gt;The overall vaccine delinquency rates may be small, but anything that causes vaccination levels to fall means more children are vulnerable. Ideally, schools try to keep their vaccination levels at 95% to help protect those children with compromised immune systems or medical conditions that keep them from being vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to vaccine delinquency, the state also tracks the percentage of students who are vaccinated, formally exempt from vaccinations, and provisionally enrolled because of vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most unvaccinated students in Texas are permitted to enroll because they have an exemption form or a note from a doctor. They can also provisionally enroll without proving vaccination status if they are homeless, military dependents or in foster care and their records cannot be obtained by the start of the school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Texas measles kindergarten vaccination rate of 93% is the lowest it’s been since at least 2011, ranking the state 18th nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The decrease in vaccination rates overall is certainly a concern because it leaves our population vulnerable to different infections,” said Dr. Erin Nicholson, a pediatric infection physician at Texas Children’s Hospital and an assistant professor at Baylor College of Medicine. “And we saw that front and center with the measles outbreak that recently happened.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Schools: A first line of defense against infectious disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time most children enter kindergarten, they have received two MMR vaccination doses, &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.bswhealth.com/conditions/measles-rubeola/mmr-vaccine" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;which will provide lifelong protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; against measles, as well as mumps and rubella for most people. The MMR vaccination for kindergarteners is considered one of the &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://odphp.health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/browse-objectives/vaccination/maintain-vaccination-coverage-level-2-doses-mmr-vaccine-children-kindergarten-iid-04" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;most important immunization targets by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State health officials audit school vaccination records each year for accuracy, by sampling school district records, explains Chris Van Deusen, spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services. But there is nothing in state rules that requires DSHS to enforce the vaccination requirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the de facto enforcement has traditionally fallen to school districts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the state’s highest kindergarten measles delinquency rates were in larger school districts and charter networks: KIPP Texas Public Schools (44%), Spring ISD (30%), Austin ISD (23%), Dallas ISD (20%), and Houston ISD (7%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five public school systems with the highest counts made up more than half of all delinquent kindergartners in the state, despite enrolling less than 10% of the state’s public school kindergarteners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some district officials, including Dallas, say they try to follow state requirements by sending home students who do not have completed vaccination requirements or an exemption. But, they enroll those students, contributing to the district’s vaccine delinquency rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Austin school district will also enroll the students who don’t meet vaccine requirements, but they wait to send those students home until their parents have been notified of their vaccine delinquency three times, Bejarano said. They can return once they have proof of vaccination or the exemption form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State data doesn’t track how many vaccine-delinquent students school districts send home. It also doesn’t reflect changes to vaccine delinquency later in the year because the data is based on surveys school districts submit in the first half of the school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some school districts say they try to send home students who don’t meet vaccine requirements, Houston ISD officials said they are keeping those students in the classroom. They, too, dedicate time and resources to track all students’ vaccination status and try to communicate information with parents about the need for staying up to date on the schedule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, they are “not excluding students from learning based on vaccine status,” according to a statement to the Tribune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chanthini Thomas, a school nurse who retired from her job at Houston ISD’s Bellaire High School last summer, said the conflicting messages from the district, resource reductions and the yearlong chase to get vaccine paperwork in was frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have little support,” she said. “Why would you say … that’s a requirement to any school for the state of Texas but then you put out a mandate from the district to say, don’t let immunizations prevent enrollment? And the reason is because they need the numbers, because the numbers were dwindling.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many other urban school districts, HISD is battling &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://perc.tamu.edu/blog/2025/06/texas-enrollment.html?utm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;declining enrollment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — and the funding that comes with it — as more families move toward better job opportunities and lower housing costs in the suburbs or choose charter and private schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As school nurses have told the Tribune over the summer, school districts choose to enroll unvaccinated children so they can keep “butts in the seats” and the base amount of money they receive from state and local sources to educate each student — &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/28/texas-school-funding-explainer/#:~:text=When%20Texas%20school%20districts%20talk,meet%20each%20student%27s%20educational%20needs." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;about $6,160&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I see the school as being in a tough spot,” said Melissa Gilkey, a University of North Carolina professor who studies vaccine efforts at schools. “We work so hard to minimize absenteeism … that I do have some sympathy for that idea that it’s hard to exclude them for one health service.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KIPP Texas Public Schools, a charter network with campuses across the state, declined an interview but insisted it was following the state immunization requirements. Its kindergarten measles vaccine delinquency rate was less than 1% in 2019 compared to 44% last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spring ISD, north of Houston, reported last year that more than 30% of its kindergarteners were measles vaccine delinquent. The district informed the Tribune it also follows state rules closely but said its high MMR delinquency rate was evidence of “enrollment and access issues” and that Spring ISD was “actively working to strengthen this process.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spring district cited family’s frequent moves in the area, limited access to health care and language barriers as reasons there’s a delay in getting student shot records updated in time for school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are committed to improving compliance rates and ensuring our students are protected against preventable diseases,” said Shane Strubhart, the Spring ISD spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Access to vaccines has dwindled&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pandemic disrupted preventive health care, becoming most apparent in some of the most recent kindergarten classes, filled with students born around the first COVID-19 outbreak. The COVID-19 pandemic not only interrupted home and school life, experts say, it upended regular health checkups younger children typically receive before they start school and that impact continues to be felt today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Families “going to see the doctors got off track for everyone during the pandemic,” Austin ISD’s Bejarano said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For low-income and immigrant families who already found health care access a challenge, more are struggling to find what Bejarano calls their “medical” home, a regular primary care doctor who can either vaccinate their children or answer concerns and perhaps direct them to the state’s exemption process if they feel strong enough to opt out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“COVID didn’t do vaccination or education and many other things as a whole, any favors,” said Jennifer Finley, executive director of health services for Dallas ISD. The district’s kindergarten measles delinquency rate jumped to 20% last school year compared to 1% during the 2019-20 school year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diminished vaccine access is also a factor. Up until the early aughts, public health departments, churches and even lawmakers would hold free or low-cost immunization clinics over the summer for families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2004, the Dallas school district turned away hundreds of students, who walked and drove to nearby clinics for free or low-cost vaccines, according to a Dallas Morning News article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the pandemic, those resources are even fewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It really stopped during the pandemic,” Finley said. “Some of the folks lost their funding.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schools rely heavily on local public health departments to help them with vaccination clinics. Once the threat of COVID lessened, public health departments used those funds to add more staff and hold more vaccination clinics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But two things began &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/08/18/texas-school-vaccination-budget-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;impacting vaccination efforts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by local health departments. First, those leftover funds were clawed back early by the Trump administration this year, prompting some staff to look for other jobs, thereby causing staff shortages in public health vaccination departments. And second, public health officials suspect more immigrant families are shying away from vaccination because of stepped-up immigration efforts and deportations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Texas, there are an &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/01/18/texas-border-schools-donald-trump-mass-deportations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;estimated 111,000 immigrant children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, all of whom do not qualify for state Medicaid health insurance coverage, attending school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We typically have big lines and the waiting room is packed. Our whole lobby is packed,” Dr. Phil Huang, the director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department, told the Tribune in August. “This year it has not been that way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vaccine hesitancy changing school messaging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the pandemic, many parents watched as debates raged over the safety of the quickly-developed COVID-19 vaccine. As a result, they are asking more questions about all childhood vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many cases, parents are spreading MMR doses out and that, too, could be the reason for more kindergartners showing up with an incomplete vaccination status, Bejarano said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main concern (among parents) is basically, ‘Am I doing the right thing for my child, that is in their best interest and help me understand what the risks are of these infectious diseases that vaccines are trying to prevent,’” Nicholson, the Texas Children’s physician, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before COVID, many doctors adopted an imperial tone — “you should do this because I’m the expert,” she said. That changed after the pandemic. “We are looking at how we talk to these parents, because the last thing that we want to do is come across as condescending.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;School nurses have also worked tirelessly to try to find a winning formula to reach families of vaccine-delinquent kids. At a national school nurse conference in Austin this summer, an entire session was devoted to teaching nurses how to have tension-free conversations with parents who are skeptical of vaccine requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, school nurses just want to inform parents of their two options to stay compliant with state rules: either provide proof of vaccination or an exemption, Bejarano said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve made these large campaigns and we are really kind when they register, letting them know what is the law, what the exemptions (are),” Bejarano said. “I just think the district in general is understanding we need to do better when it comes to public health and getting these rates up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news, she says, is that the greater efforts made by school nurses in the fall to try to help parents become vaccine compliant tends to push down the high delinquency rates by the end of the school year. Data provided to the Tribune by Austin ISD proved that out. That 23% delinquency rate for kindergartners recorded in the fall of 2024 fell drastically to 6% by May 2025 possibly due to the fear produced by the measles outbreak in the months prior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I do think that everybody came together in the Austin community and really did try to push for that” compliance, Bejarano said. “And I think that’s why it helped the rate last year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finley points to other lesser-known reasons complicating the back-to-school vaccination picture. Among them, an influx of students came to Texas from other states, many already armed with vaccination exemptions or with incomplete vaccination histories who are having to be re-educated about Texas requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting Sept. 1, Texas parents can more easily obtain a vaccine exemption form by downloading it off the state’s website, but how that will impact the delinquency gap won’t be seen until data is released next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="optimizelyHubpeekId" class="optimizelyHubpeekClass"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicholson, Finley, Bejarano and others say they would like to see more data that clearly explains the rising delinquency rate and how many students who were once marked delinquent end up becoming fully vaccinated or obtaining an exemption by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Does it mean, you know, people are just struggling with paperwork?” Nicholson said. “Or does it mean that really those vaccinations are falling?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story was originally published by &lt;span class="LinkEnhancement"&gt;&lt;a class="Link AnClick-LinkEnhancement" data-gtm-enhancement-style="LinkEnhancementA" href="https://www.texastribune.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Texas Tribune&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and distributed through a partnership with The Associated Press.&lt;/p&gt;
