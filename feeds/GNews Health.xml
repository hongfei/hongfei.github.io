native suffered a six-day migraine that left him unable to eat and constantly feeling dizzy, nauseous and sensitive to light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It was then that the now 38-year-old was taken to the emergency room, where scans revealed a large 'mass' in his head that had wrapped around one of his vital blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors diagnosed him &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14888545/New-dad-dying-brain-cancer-days-son-birthday-glioblastoma.html"&gt;with glioblastoma&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most aggressive and deadly types of brain &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-b8227300-6334-11f0-ba8e-3b04051855cf" class=""&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; which most patients do not survive for longer than 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Revealing his symptoms to &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.today.com/health/men-s-health/glioblastoma-symptoms-migraine-rcna218836"&gt;TODAY&lt;/a&gt;, he said: 'I had a headache for six days straight. I wasn't eating. I was sleeping a lot and just not myself. I was just out of it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Just six days after the diagnosis, he was rushed through for major surgery where doctors cut out part of his skull to remove 90 percent of the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But during the surgery, one of his major blood vessels spasmed, causing a stroke and now leaving him struggling to move anything on the left side of his body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Branden Newman is pictured above with his wife Joanna. He was diagnosed with glioblastoma in May this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Glioblastomas can be diagnosed at any age and are particularly difficult to treat because the tumors can grow tentacles deep into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 12,000 people are diagnosed with the disease every year, and only five percent of them survive longer than five years, estimates suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases are rising, experts say, including a slight uptick among those under 40 years old, but physicians are stumped as to the cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Newman went to his primary care doctor, and then the emergency room after his wife Joanna, who works in a physician's office, recommended that he got checked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Branden had a migraine for six days,' she told local news station &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.kcentv.com/article/news/local/overcome-this-salado-couples-love-story-becomes-battle-against-rare-brain-cancer/500-b3daed9d-9b07-45fe-9783-54ee8de855ad"&gt;KCENTV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He's always had migraines, but this one was different because it lasted so long and he was nauseous and the light really bothered him.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Revealing the moment she found out the diagnosis, she said: 'My boss came and got me out of the [operating room] and told me that they found a mass on Branden and I lost it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was diagnosed with a 'mass' on May 2, and underwent a craniotomy to remove it on May 8, a surgery where doctors cut open the skull to access the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;To treat the cancer, doctors opened his skull and removed 90 percent of the tumor from his brain. The above photo is from after the surgery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He has endured radiation for six weeks followed by weekly chemotherapy for six months to eliminate the tumor cells, and is now undergoing daily chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Newman is also taking perampanel, an anti-seizure medication that can have anti-tumor effects, and gabapentin, also an anti-seizure drug that has been linked to improved survival among people with the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors said that during the surgery, they tried to remove the tumor from around his middle cerebral artery,&lt;span&gt; one of the three major arteries that supply blood to the brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But during the procedure, the blood vessel spasmed, causing a stroke and damage to the brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He was initially unable to move his left side after waking up from surgery but has now recovered enough movement to walk again. He is still having trouble with his left arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Newman revealed his diagnosis amid Glioblastoma Awareness Day on July 16, which aims to make more people aware of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Warning signs of the disease include a persistent headache, vomiting, loss of appetite, double vision and changes in mood and personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors say the overwhelming majority of headaches do not represent tumors, but those who are concerned should speak to their primary care providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The pair, from Texas, are childhood sweethearts having met in 2000 when Branden was 13 years old and she was just 11 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Newman and his wife were childhood sweethearts, having met when he was 13 and she was just 11 years old while on a camping trip. The pair dated in high school and married in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But shortly after the wedding, the pair faced a crisis when Newman's wife was unexpectedly diagnosed with a non-cancerous spinal cord tumor that left her struggling to walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Newman stuck by her and supported her through the surgery and the recovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;His wife said: 'Branden stuck by me through all of that, even at such a young age and facing life with potentially having your wife in a wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He took great care of me all the way through. I am so grateful. He's such a good man.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She is now looking after Newman and helping to support him while he battles his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pair has also launched a fundraiser to help cover hospital and emergency bills triggered by battling the disease. It has already raised $140,000 out of its $35,000 goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 19:38:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>亚当斯县2人感染西尼罗河病毒- KUSA.com | 2 people in Adams County infected with West Nile Virus - KUSA.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiugFBVV95cUxNWTJxaWY1YVlmMGt0amlXV1pkN3V2OXFUWm81QnVKdDE4bXcwb19RM3pHNFQ2MVVNRjlsQ1FCOEdGVkJnWmljSGhIU3F5dGJ0dHAtLVVYeU9SeFFyTHhVckVuX0t5aDlWTk9rX2RkX1ZaaXVacF9SY2M3YlZ6NG9ZbmdZa2tiN2ZwZ1Rwd0Q4RVVhQUx3TnJzc0FBRTVwcHZLVi0yT1dOY1VnZU5YaXc4MC0ydUZrRmFDLXc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

People infected &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-7471039/Toddler-diagnosed-case-drug-resistant-typhoid-trip-Pakistan.html"&gt;with resistant typhoid&lt;/a&gt; carry it to new countries, while the global food trade spreads resistant bacteria to dense cities with poor sanitation accelerates the spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers warned that the most commonly used antibiotics, including Ampicillin, Chloramphenicol, and Azithromycin, may not save patients’ lives like they used to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Approximately 5,700 Americans become ill each year, and 620 are hospitalized. Deaths from typhoid fever in the US are very infrequent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jason Andrews, a specialist in infectious diseases at Stanford University and lead author of the report, said the breakneck pace at which S. Typhi is spreading ‘is a real cause for concern.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typhoid fever sickens 11million people every year, causing fever, abdominal pain, and, if left untreated, intestinal bleeding and &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/sepsis/index.html" id="mol-d4cb4440-632b-11f0-970a-09a9b27031ec"&gt;sepsis&lt;/a&gt;. It kills about 100,000 people annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Our study found resistant typhoid crossed borders 197 times since 1990 - mostly within South Asia, and spreading to Africa and beyond&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around one in five people who are not treated for typhoid will die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When the genes of a strain of bacteria mutate to resist antibiotics, doctors have far fewer treatment options when patients present with typhoid symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers analyzed the genetics of over 7,600 samples of S. Typhi, including 3,489 samples from individuals with typhoid in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan from 2014 to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also looked at 4,169 older samples from more than 70 countries, some dating back to 1905. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They pored over the bacteria’s genetic blueprint to identify genes that can change the bacterial protein that antibiotics usually attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This causes the bacteria to make enzymes that break down the drug, eject antibiotics before they work, or use alternative biochemical pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team warned that typhoid-causing bacteria are mutating so rapidly that modern medicine can’t keep up, stating that by the time scientists decide to use vaccines based on today's resistance data, it may already be too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;South Asia is a hotspot where resistance continues to develop and then spreads globally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Approximately 5,700 Americans become ill each year, and 620 are hospitalized. Deaths from typhoid fever in the US are very infrequent (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since 1990, strains resistant to the antibiotic class quinolones have evolved independently at least 94 times, with 97 percent of these cases originating in South Asia, specifically in countries such as India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;What began as localized resistance, affecting 85 percent of Bangladeshi typhoid cases by the early 2000s, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-5618227/First-known-epidemic-drug-resistant-typhoid-spreading-Pakistan.html"&gt;exploded across the region&lt;/a&gt;, surpassing a 95 percent prevalence in India, Pakistan, and Nepal within a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The pattern repeats with newer drugs. Azithromycin resistance has emerged seven times since 2003, with Bangladeshi strains steadily proliferating since 2013, while resistance to last-line antibiotics cephalosporins now looms as the next frontier in the escalating crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While these strains most often occur within South Asia and spread from there to Southeast Asia, East Africa, and Southern Africa, they have also been reported in the US, UK and Canada. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Andrew said: ‘The fact resistant strains of S. Typhi have spread internationally so many times also underscores the need to view typhoid control, and antibiotic resistance more generally, as a global rather than local problem.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research was published in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(22)00093-3/fulltext"&gt;The Lancet Microbe&lt;/a&gt; journal.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typhoid is rare in the US, and cases typically arise after a person has traveled internationally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It primarily affects people in areas with poor sanitation, and children under five are more susceptible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2018, a Massachusetts daycare center temporarily closed after a child &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/article-5715271/Child-diagnosed-typhoid-fever-Massachusetts-daycare.html"&gt;was diagnosed with typhoid&lt;/a&gt;, likely contracted during recent international travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typhoid fever spreads through fecal-oral transmission, meaning people ingest the bacteria Salmonella Typhi from food, water, or surfaces that have come in contact with fecal matter, such as eating food handled by someone with typhoid who didn’t wash their hands after using the bathroom.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study has some gaps that need to be considered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers lacked sufficient genetic data from key regions, particularly parts of Africa and Oceania, where typhoid is prevalent. Without more samples from these areas, it is more difficult to track how and when resistant strains spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even in countries with better monitoring, most samples are collected from just a few locations, which may not accurately reflect what is happening elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And since only a small fraction of typhoid cases get genetically tested, the true scale of antibiotic resistance and global spread is probably even worse than the numbers show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said THIS highlights the need ‘to expand genomic surveillance to provide a more comprehensive window into the emergence, expansion, and spread of antibiotic-resistant organisms.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 18:08:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>使用David Baker的新人工智能技术，无法治疗的“无序”蛋白质变得可以吸毒- STAT | Undruggable ‘disordered’ proteins become druggable with new AI techniques from David Baker - STAT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxON2l2X01jNmVDb3pmNGVNN3JNTWtVQW43VS1rY0xtZ3hYaXV1Qkc2YW1vZzA2TWdRMHY3cG5kM2xLQ3h6clhwU0w0NGtTT1RkU25JUU5VTmJkN01jVC1mWjY0WXZ0clRGMC1ObmtPVTdMbWNIWTRKTEliems3N3h1a3N2QkkzbTM3RmhyeFV2WFBnTWtlWFo1LVpmbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, structural biologists shoved what looked like shoddy data in the back of their closets, embarrassed. While attempting to gather the structures of proteins, they would sometimes find that all or at least a portion of the protein would just not show up correctly in the data. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Joel Sussman, a former head of the Protein Data Bank, remembers when he found his first intrinsically disordered protein, though it wasn’t called that at the time. He showed it to a collaborator. “‘Oh, Joel, you’re not a very good biochemist. Obviously, it has a structure and you’re confused,’” he recalled her saying.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most proteins fold into shapes with distinct elements: the ordered spiral of an alpha-helix, like a piece of cavatappi pasta; or beta sheets, like a slice of a lasagna — squiggly lines of pasta amino acids held parallel to each other with cheesy and saucy hydrogen bonds. A central tenet of structural biology is that a protein’s structure dictates its function. But &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S003169972411616X" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;around the same time&lt;/a&gt; that the world was preparing for Y2K, structural biologists finally began admitting that — just as Sussman and other scientists had seen — not all proteins have a permanent shape. A surprisingly large amount of important proteins (in fact, over &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cr400713r" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;half of all proteins in eukaryotes&lt;/a&gt;, it’s estimated) have strands of wiggly “spaghetti” in them. &lt;/p&gt;

While tau proteins twist together in fiber-like strands called tangles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The plaques and tangles block the ability of the brain's neurons to send electrical and chemical signals back and forth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, this disruption causes permanent damage in the brain that leads to Alzheimer's disease and dementia, causing patients to lose their ability to speak, care for themselves or even respond to the world around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;About 7million people in the US 65 and older live with the condition and over 100,00 die from it annually. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Leading health experts recommend taking 5,000 IU of vitamin D3 - priced at 20 cents per capsule or $17.99 for 90 - every day&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Alzheimer's Association estimates that by 2050, nearly 13 million Americans will be living with the disease.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While there is no clear cause of the Alzheimer's disease, experts believe it can develop due to genetic mutations and lifestyle choices, such as physical inactivity, unhealthy diet and social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additional studies have also shown that Vitamin D &lt;span&gt;provides protection to the brain cells, regulates nerve growth as well as genes important for brain function.  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typically, the body makes vitamin D from direct sunlight on the skin or absorbs it from foods such as milk, egg yolks, beef liver, mushrooms and fatty fishes like salmon and mackerel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts suggest that having a vitamin D level of 20 nanograms/ milliliter (mg/ml) in the blood or higher is adequate for good bone health and anything below 20ng/ml is considered a deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But despite the critical role it plays, nearly 40 percent of adults are Vitamin D deficient, meaning they are more likely to develop conditions such as osteoporosis (fragile bones), heart problems and Type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, it also aids the function of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin, which play vital roles in overall mood, cognition and behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Therefore, a deficiency can damage the cell and nerve growth process in the brain which can cause a decline in cognitive abilities, including executive functions like paying attention and processing information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Brain cell and nerve damage can also contribute to problems in the hippocampus, a brain region crucial for memory formation, which in turn can impair communication between brain regions as well as the brain and rest of the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Taking regular Vitamin D supplements can help protect brain cells,contribute to brain development and maintain cognitive function&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin D deficiency can manifest in symptoms similar to depression, such as low mood, fatigue and loss of interest in activities - all of which are major contributors to the development of dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, taking regular vitamin D supplements can help maintain healthy levels of the vitamin in the body which can help protection brain cells, contribute to brain development and maintain cognitive function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Vitamin D supplements can also help reduce oxidative stress in the brain, described as an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in the body that leads to cell damage and various neurological conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, Vitamin D has anti-inflammatory properties that can help slow down cognitive decline in older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Apart from capsules, Vitamin D levels in the blood can also be increased by eating consuming foods such as fatty fish and milk while also spending more time in the sun. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

But there’s also some DNA outside of the cell’s nucleus, in structures called mitochondria. Dangerous mutations there can cause a range of diseases in children that can lead to muscle weakness, seizures, developmental delays, major organ failure and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-093ea3" class="body-graf"&gt;Testing during the in vitro fertilization process can usually identify whether these mutations are present. But in rare cases, it’s not clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dcbca7" class="body-graf"&gt;Researchers have been developing a technique that tries to avoid the problem by using the healthy mitochondria from a donor egg. They reported in 2023 that the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/britain-genetic-babies-mitochondria-three-parent-6d826809d66a4474bc9dc455c475ad58"&gt;first babies&lt;/a&gt; had been born using this method, where scientists take genetic material from the mother’s egg or embryo, which is then transferred into a donor egg or embryo that has healthy mitochondria but the rest of its key DNA removed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6868f3" class="body-graf"&gt;The latest research “marks an important milestone,” said Dr. Zev Williams, who directs the Columbia University Fertility Center and was not involved in the work. “Expanding the range of reproductive options … will empower more couples to pursue safe and healthy pregnancies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d8adb7" class="body-graf"&gt;Using this method means the embryo has &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/baby-born-using-three-parent-technique-doctors-say-n655701" target="_blank"&gt;DNA from three people&lt;/a&gt; — from the mother’s egg, the father’s sperm and the donor’s mitochondria — and it required a &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/general-news-parenting-relationships-69d7ed6e2c6b4072b0e3d036ecb939a3"&gt;2016 U.K. law change&lt;/a&gt; to approve it. It is also allowed in Australia but not in many other countries, including the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-45021d" class="body-graf"&gt;Experts at Britain’s Newcastle University and Monash University in Australia reported in the New England Journal of Medicine Wednesday that they performed the new technique in fertilized embryos from 22 patients, which resulted in eight babies that appear to be free of mitochondrial diseases.

But that can change, especially as we age and our bodies demand more. Older people are at an increased risk of &lt;a data-id="10e454ed-6cd7-49d6-8f0b-9ce0ec0db1f9" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2682456/" target="_self"&gt;low vitamin consumption&lt;/a&gt; -- partly because our bodies can no longer absorb certain nutrients as effectively as they once did. So, if you're dealing with deficiencies, are on specific medications or have particular health conditions, your doctor may advise you to take certain supplements to make sure your body has all the nutrients it needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;But which supplements should you be taking? These are the top six vitamins and minerals that doctors recommend you focus on for healthy aging.

For reference, the daily recommended amount of magnesium is &lt;a data-id="53ddc272-06c0-4163-803c-1cb0ea0d08e8" href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/are-you-getting-enough-magnesium" target="_self"&gt;400 to 420mg per day for adult men&lt;/a&gt; and 310 to 320mg for women, but more is needed for those who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teitelbaum warned that the effects of low magnesium may include an &lt;a data-id="e95916e7-01a3-4e39-91df-ba7f313269e4" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circulationaha.105.588327" target="_self"&gt;increased risk of metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. This can lead to heart attacks, strokes and dementia. You may also feel exhausted or experience widespread muscle pain if you're not getting enough magnesium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find magnesium in a wide range of ingredients. &lt;a data-id="13513cc5-8787-4d07-9629-4ad2a60f0e83" href="https://fatlotofgood.com.au/" target="_self"&gt;Dr. Peter Brukner&lt;/a&gt;, a specialist sports and exercise physician, said you can find magnesium in nuts, seeds, whole grains and leafy green vegetables like spinach. In extra yummy news, you can also get magnesium from dark chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some older adults or those who take specific medicines (such as diuretics or drugs for acid reflux) may not receive enough magnesium from their diet and might need &lt;a data-id="ce6d0373-730f-443f-8f3e-c59ebe8e1890" href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/5-best-magnesium-supplements/" target="_self"&gt;a supplement&lt;/a&gt;," he said.

Vitamin B-12 works with folate to help your body make new cells, including blood cells and nerve cells. While you don't usually require more B12 as you age, your &lt;a data-id="699664f9-a354-43ad-89c2-00fe96cb5f28" href="https://aging.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nutrition-Needs_Vitamin-B12_FINAL-2.18.pdf" target="_self"&gt;body can't absorb it as well&lt;/a&gt; when you get older. Brukner said this is because "stomachs make less acid, and this acid is necessary to take the vitamin from food into the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teitelbaum said B vitamins are critical for energy production, and suboptimal levels can affect your health. He warns that B vitamin deficiency has been associated with "a &lt;a data-id="62a38b00-866c-4718-bb35-e93cd6b25a9e" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8079632/#s5" target="_self"&gt;marked increase of dementia&lt;/a&gt; (especially folic acid) and &lt;a data-id="62a38b00-866c-4718-bb35-e93cd6b25a9e" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749379715000732" target="_self"&gt;increased risk of heart attack and stroke&lt;/a&gt; (especially in those with elevated homocysteine levels)." Symptoms of B12 deficiency include weakness or poor balance, loss of appetite and numbness and tingling in the hands and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B12 is found in animal proteins like meat, fish and eggs. Brukner said that if you don't eat these foods, you may want to turn to foods like cereals and nutritional yeast with added B12. "Older people, especially those having certain stomach issues or taking medicine that lowers stomach acid, might need to take a B12 vitamin supplement," he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-id="4bcc0d6a-5e1b-4506-a312-ccce96fb8e02" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amelia-ti/" target="_self"&gt;Amelia Ti&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and diabetes educator in New York, who is also part of &lt;a data-id="4bcc0d6a-5e1b-4506-a312-ccce96fb8e02" href="https://www.cnet.com/health/how-we-ensure-accurate-and-reliable-medical-information/" target="_self"&gt;CNET's Medical Review Board&lt;/a&gt;, adds that people taking medicine that blocks B12 absorption, like omeprazole or metformin, may also need a vitamin B12 supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="63b88bbd-7786-4e03-b50d-6188e59d0f33" data-ng-block="{"&gt;3.

I’ve always thought this was a bizarre quirk, but the problem is that black mold was discovered in his parents’ home—a lot of it. They are going to be staying with us until it is cleared out, which could be a month or more. I don’t think I can go without sex that long! Is there any way to remedy this?&lt;/p&gt;

However, I have a strong suspicion that the husband’s temporary erectile dysfunction in response to his mother is going to require a significant amount of therapy. And the time to strongly suggest he consider looking into therapy was many years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="15" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7ky2sf001a3b77t5w9i12m@published"&gt;Did the writer ever ask the husband, what’s up with this? When did it start?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="56" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7ky2uj001b3b77ua4msken@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich Juzwiak: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes, when did it start? Because if it was always a thing, then he wasn’t masturbating as a teenager, as somebody living with parents. So I would have a lot more kinds of questions for the husband. It really does, to your point, seem like something to at least talk about with a professional.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="38" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7ky2wl001c3b776jy7yuqy@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s not the kind of thing that’s likely to be resolved in maybe a bit more than a month. Right? I’m not even sure you can get into a therapist that quickly in the U.S. these days.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="123" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7ky2yo001d3b77qgnov34s@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich: &lt;/strong&gt;A long-term solution is in order. Also, this is, at least temporarily, an issue that has an endpoint in sight. So it’s annoying for our writer to go a month or so without sex, but you can do it. It’s possible. It’s not food, you’re not going to starve. It’s sex, you can take care of yourself. You may not be able to avoid his mom during this period. So, that’s what it is. Given the abundance of issues that we see, not just in this column but in the world, I’m finding it a little bit difficult to sympathize. As much as I understand this is a serious issue, I also know you will live to see another day of sex.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="27" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7ky30u001e3b776cxff4fc@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica: &lt;/strong&gt;I’m able to sympathize. But at the end of the day, it’s just inconvenient. An erection is not the be-all and end-all of partnered sexual interaction.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="4" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7ky32p001f3b77bkwleo7j@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich:&lt;/strong&gt; That’s very true.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="130" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7ky34s001g3b77760zlzy4@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica: &lt;/strong&gt;Lots of couples don’t have any penises in the mix at all and have a great time together. Plenty of other people, for one reason or another, are partnered with someone who has a penis that doesn’t reliably become erect. Sometimes there is an erect penis, and people still choose to have sex without engaging with the penis. So, they’ve got a lot of options; all they have to do is get a little bit creative. I am a bit sorry that you’re not going to get dicked down real good during this time. But you will survive. If the husband is of the mindset that because he’s not hard, they’re not going to have sex, then you have hands. You can get sex toys and use your imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="114" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7ky3cf001j3b77horp1s3b@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich: &lt;/strong&gt;I also wonder what the husband has done to counteract this. Has he tried a PDE5 inhibitor? Has he used a cock ring? Sometimes you need that extra kind of assurance or lift to knock yourself out of a pattern. And then once you understand that you can do it through medical means, the psychological aspect can fall to the background because you’re just bumping yourself out of that loop of, &lt;em&gt;I see my mom, I can’t get an erection, this is my life&lt;/em&gt;. But then, if you can assist yourself medically, you can show yourself that you can do it. So, I wonder how much he has actually practiced getting over this.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="43" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7ky3ek001k3b77yc4wgarf@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessica:&lt;/strong&gt; That is a really good point. Regarding this sentence: “I don’t think I can go without sex that long!”, think about that. What is sex doing for you in your life that maybe could be spread out over a more diverse toolbox?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="106" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd7ky3gj001l3b77nxgxb930@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich: &lt;/strong&gt;Is it stress relief? Because if it is, you could try exercise or acts of charity. If you’re bored, you can read or watch a million things that are on TV. And if you’re that horny, again, just masturbate or have him masturbate with you. Figure out a different way for a little bit. It’s an opportunity to explore. This isn’t one of those situations where it’s the parents are staying with you, and if they hear you, it’s going to create a rift. It seems like they can still do whatever they’d like while the parents are living there. So create a new frontier.&lt;/p&gt;

However, small mutations in mitochondrial DNA can affect tissues with high-energy demands such as the heart, muscle and brain, causing devastating disease and, in some cases, death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Mitochondrial DNA is inherited from the mother, and although males can be affected, they do not transmit the disease, researchers said. About 1 in 5,000 babies are born worldwide each year with mutations that can cause the disease, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, scientists have detailed how an IVF technique called pronuclear transfer has been used to combine the DNA of three people to reduce the risk of mitochondrial disease being passed down the generations, in accompanying studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The technique uses 99.9 percent of the DNA from a man and woman, with another 0.1 percent from a second woman’s donor egg. It works by transplanting the nuclear genome of an egg from the mother with the condition - which contains genes essential for individual characteristics like hair color and height - to an egg donated by an unaffected woman that has had its nuclear genome removed, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The resulting embryo inherits nuclear DNA from its two parents, but the mitochondrial DNA comes from the donated egg, researchers said. The treatment was offered to certain women at very high risk of passing on serious mitochondrial disease, in accordance with U.K. regulations that assess each application for the procedure on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The eight infants &lt;strong&gt;- &lt;/strong&gt;who range in age from newborn to over 2 years old&lt;strong&gt; - &lt;/strong&gt;were assessed to be healthy, meeting developmental milestones and reported levels of mitochondrial disease-causing mutations that were undetectable or at levels unlikely to cause disease, the Newcastle University statement said. Three of the babies had levels of disease-causing mitochondrial DNA mutations of up to 20 percent, which is still below the 80 percent threshold for clinical disease, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Doug Turnbull, a neurologist at Newcastle University who co-wrote the study, said it was the first to document a “cohort” of children who had received the treatment. He said it is the result of an extremely cautious approach by scientists and regulators that has been more than two decades in the making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“People have used very similar techniques, but nobody’s quite used this particular technique,” he told The Washington Post in a phone interview Thursday. “It’s just absolutely critical when you’re doing a new technique to be cautious and to make sure … it’s as safe and efficient as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The procedure has also raised concern from some, including religious groups, about its ethics and the fear that it could open the door to further genetic modification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Peter Thompson, chief executive of the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority, which regulates the process in Britain, said that only people with a “very high risk” of passing on a serious mitochondrial disease are eligible for the treatment and that every application is assessed individually. As of July 1, 35 patients have been granted approval by U.K. authorities to proceed with the treatment since it was first licensed in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“These robust but flexible regulatory processes allow the technique to be used safely for the purposes that Parliament agreed in 2015,” Thompson said in a statement in response to Wednesday’s news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Scientists have cautiously welcomed the findings, while stressing the importance of long-term monitoring and raising the prospect of whether the procedure offers advantages over embryo screening for genetic disease. Others have raised the issue of cost in the long-term project that is supported by Britain’s National Health Service and medical charity the Wellcome Trust, among other groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Mary Herbert, who is professor of reproductive biology at Newcastle University and lead author of the research paper, said “the findings give grounds for optimism” but further research is needed to “bridge the gap” between reducing risk of mitochondrial disease and preventing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Turnbull said the team is also looking to improve medical techniques and follow up with the children involved for as long as possible to track their health outcomes. He said researchers are offering health assessments for five years, but it “would be lovely to be able to follow them up much longer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Joanna Poulton, a professor in mitochondrial genetics at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the research, said “time will tell” whether the treatment results in “dramatic clinical advance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The births come amid a wider boom in genomic sequencing and IVF start-ups that have sparked a wider debate about the ethics and science behind embryo screening and genetic preselection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the United States, those undertaking IVF typically test for rare genetic disorders stemming from a single gene mutation, such as cystic fibrosis, or chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome. The use of donor mitochondria, however, is not permitted under U.S. regulations. In Britain, the creation of babies using DNA from three people was first made legal in 2015, hailed for its ability to prevent serious disease being passed on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Related Content&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2025/honduras-trans-woman-asylum-trump/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:An asylum seeker abandons her claim and leaves Trump’s America;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;An asylum seeker abandons her claim and leaves Trump’s America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/07/11/trump-rally-shooting-aaron-zaliponi-swat-team/?utm_source=yahoo&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=nss_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:He may have stopped Trump’s would-be assassin.

Since doctors don’t routinely screen for pancreatic, stomach and esophageal cancers in the U.S., the authors also call for new ways to screen more people for these cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b076ae" class="body-graf"&gt;“This really points to the importance of trying to improve screening and early detection,” said Dr. Kimmie Ng, the review’s co-author and director of the Young-Onset Colorectal Cancer Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4b6487" class="body-graf"&gt;According to the review, colorectal cancer is by far the most common early-onset gastrointestinal cancer, with nearly 185,000 cases reported worldwide in 2022 and nearly 21,000 cases reported that same year in the U.S. Diagnoses in the U.S. have risen 2% annually in people younger than 50 since 2011, &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures-2023.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;according to the American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-bb3245" class="body-graf"&gt;“It never used to happen in this age group, and now a very significant rise in 20-, 30- and 40-year-olds are getting colon cancer,” said Dr. John Marshall, chief medical consultant at the nonprofit &lt;a href="http://colorectalcancer.org" target="_blank"&gt;Colorectal Cancer Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, who was not involved in the research. In one of the most high-profile examples, actor Chadwick Boseman was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2016 and died of the disease four years later at age 43.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-9f1ab0" class="body-graf"&gt;Early-onset cases of pancreatic, stomach and esophageal cancers are also rising, according to the new study.

Pancreatic cancer is among the deadliest forms of cancer, with just &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/pancreatic-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates.html" target="_blank"&gt;13% of patients&lt;/a&gt; surviving five years after their diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6677ef" class="body-graf"&gt;Because colorectal cancer is the most common, doctors said they have a better grasp of what might be contributing to these early-onset cases compared with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c691c5" class="body-graf"&gt;“If we can understand what’s going on in colorectal [cancer], I think it would really provide a lot of guidance to help us understand the other GI tract cancers,” said Dr. Scott Kopetz, a professor of gastrointestinal medical oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-eb5c48" class="body-graf"&gt;Kopetz said there are likely multiple factors driving the increase in early-onset cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7083ee" class="body-graf"&gt;“The leading theory is that there is no single leading theory,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6405bd" class="body-graf"&gt;Ng’s new review in JAMA suggests that most gastrointestinal cancers in people under 50 are associated with lifestyle factors such as obesity, lack of exercise, poor diet, cigarette smoking or alcohol consumption. One &lt;a href="https://gut.bmj.com/content/70/12/2330" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; included in the review found that women who consumed more sugar-sweetened beverages during adolescence had a higher risk of developing early-onset colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-46cefa" class="body-graf"&gt;“It’s really what people were doing or exposed to when they were infants, children, adolescents that is probably contributing to their risk of developing cancer as a young adult,” Ng said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-acb79f" class="body-graf"&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been vocal about the association between &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-announces-plans-remove-artificial-dyes-nations-food-supply-rcna202184" target="_blank"&gt;sugary beverages and health issues&lt;/a&gt;, including cancer. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump said Coca-Cola will start being made with cane sugar rather than corn syrup in the U.S., but the company &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/coca-cola-dodges-trump-says-soda-will-switch-back-cane-sugar-rcna219225" target="_blank"&gt;did not commit to the change&lt;/a&gt; when asked about it by NBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e93909" class="body-graf"&gt;Marshall said he suspects the rise in early-onset colorectal cancer could have something to do with changes in people’s gut microbiomes — the bacteria that live in our gastrointestinal tracts. Diet, antibiotic use, microplastics and exposure to environmental chemicals likely all influence a person’s gut bacteria, but scientists still don’t have a clear understanding of what a healthy microbiome looks like nor how it affects our health. That is a booming area of research.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b6ba4c" class="body-graf"&gt;Ng’s review also found that 15% to 30% of people with early-onset gastrointestinal cancer carry hereditary genetic mutations that may have predisposed them to getting cancer at a young age.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Because of that, she said, “we do recommend that all young patients diagnosed under the age of 50 undergo testing for hereditary conditions.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d70c61" class="body-graf"&gt;Overall survival rates for gastrointestinal cancers have gotten better over time, due to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/stomach-cancer-diagnosed-earlier-symptoms-survival-rcna204536" target="_blank"&gt;improvements in treatment and screening&lt;/a&gt;. But Ng’s review found that younger patients often have worse outcomes, despite typically receiving more treatments, including more surgery, radiation and aggressive combinations of chemotherapy, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1b2210" class="body-graf"&gt;One reason could be that primary care doctors may overlook symptoms such as abdominal pain, constipation, heartburn or reflux in younger patients, thereby delaying their diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4cc69f" class="body-graf"&gt;“My personal feeling is that it’s because we’re finding them at a more advanced stage, because people don’t really think of colon or other GI cancers when they see a young person with these nonspecific complaints,” said Dr. Howard Hochster, director of gastrointestinal oncology at Rutgers Cancer Institute and RWJBarnabas Health in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-732ba8" class="body-graf"&gt;But Ng said that even after controlling for the stage at which patients are diagnosed, young people still seem to have worse survival rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d4322c" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“This makes us wonder as researchers whether that means that the cancers that develop in younger people may be biologically different and more aggressive, or maybe less responsive to treatment,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 15:00:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxQNC13cnJFQlMxb21GUjQxdGtCcFFqLXRsTkprMUhYVkhLWWxSQmZmbURycFNrdlBHZXpkT2ZrbFUwZnJKYUtwME91emJiaWZmc1ctQUs3Rk9Wa2FQOUNXcGhGc1h3NTRBZFkwczlpUEN6ZGZvVEo0SDRmeVdlZGwyOTJUbGJzRzJHLTVXRzRYdXJPdWVEMTFjYU84d01acFZNVWtmd2dCTHAyTmNYVU5ITF9n0gFWQVVfeXFMTm1qc29YLUpsczRRdTJNRGtPZWV6dkpNTmVpVkRNY2JFZkdZR21FZDVnMUtVdDZyTkdWVVpmOWJvaVRzSkRib3lvS3ZqNGVCaXQ4TTNjX1E</guid></item><item><title>爱荷华州家庭的经历凸显了麻疹暴露的鲜为人知的后果- AOL.com | Iowa family's experience highlights the lesser-known consequences of a measles exposure - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTFBIMjZZamY3bWpWZ2ItS29lUy15dkJLZHNsNVZrR0JXcnFaZW43YlZFaERfbGMzc243WllvM2ZnTjd0Q1AxNmNWVFFzUE9yV0poWld4RkJLdl9uaGg0OTlScUtZa0hYejVUTm1BMXJINXYtekFzTWc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martha Martin has to use up all of her remaining vacation days for the year to stay home with her infant son, and it still won’t be enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine-month-old Hal was recently &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/texas-measles-daycare-outbreak-confirmed-cases-rcna199631" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:exposed to measles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;exposed to measles&lt;/a&gt; at day care and can’t go back for almost a full month. He’s not had the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, which isn’t recommended until age 1. When Martin has to return to work, her husband will need to take several unpaid days off to stay home with the boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It just makes me so mad that this is happening,” said Martin, 26, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. “It’s scary because my son is not protected, and I’m having to worry about child care and my job and my husband’s job.” In these situations, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/infection-control/hcp/measles/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends&lt;/a&gt; quarantine for 28 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because he’s too young for the measles vaccine, Hal needed emergency shots of immunoglobulin, or IG, an antibody that helps the immune system fight off infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, Martin said, “it’s just a waiting game.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her family’s worry and frustration are playing out in households nationwide as the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-cases-reach-highest-point-disease-was-eliminated-us-2000-rcna201421" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:number of measles cases has surpassed a level;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;number of measles cases has surpassed a level&lt;/a&gt; not seen since the highly contagious virus was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the CDC reported &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:1,309 cases of measles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;1,309 cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; in 39 states. The vast majority of patients are children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of those cases has had the opportunity to expose hundreds or even thousands of other people, especially kids, either too young to be vaccinated, like Hal, or children with weak immune systems, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ana Montanez, a pediatrician at Texas Tech Physicians in Lubbock, Texas, cared for many families during the recent &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreak-west-texas-grows-unvaccinated-rcna192163" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:measles outbreak in West Texas;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;measles outbreak in West Texas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of our families, hard-working families, typically don't have a month's savings of salary to stay home, yet they have to," Montanez said. "Oftentimes it's not just one job, but two, maybe three."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cedar Rapids isn’t experiencing an outbreak of measles. Just &lt;a href="https://www.linncountyiowa.gov/1777/Measles#" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:seven cases have been confirmed;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;seven cases have been confirmed&lt;/a&gt; across Iowa in 2025, according to the latest data in the state. They are the first reported measles cases in Iowa since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the Martin family’s situation illustrates the ripple effects of a single exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What’s happening in our town is a perfect example of why vaccination is important,” said Dr. Dustin Arnold, chief medical officer at UnityPoint Health-Cedar Rapids. “It just takes one” measles case, he said, to set off waves of impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Arnold ran a command center giving out immunoglobulin, or IG shots for eight babies who were exposed to measles at the same day care as Hal. Three others were sent to a nearby medical facility for the same treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IG injections can be given up to six days after exposure to measles. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8675579/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2021 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; found that the therapy is highly effective in protecting exposed newborns from getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IG treatments aren’t a permanent fix, said Dr. Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Children “develop much higher levels of immunity from vaccination than from immunoglobulin,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cedar Rapids IG clinics, led by Arnold, were pulled together at the very last minute. The babies who got the injections had been exposed six days earlier, on Monday, July 7. Families were notified late Friday, July 11, and the treatments started the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There are infants out there who have no protection, and we don’t want them to get sick,” Arnold said. “Measles can be mild, but it can also be life-threatening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of measles patients have fared well despite their illness. Still, 13%, or 164 patients, needed to be hospitalized because of the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three people — including two young girls in Texas — have &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/second-measles-death-texas-child-kennedy-rcna199882" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:died of measles this year;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;died of measles this year&lt;/a&gt;.

That is a booming area of research.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b6ba4c" class="body-graf"&gt;Ng’s review also found that 15% to 30% of people with early-onset gastrointestinal cancer carry hereditary genetic mutations that may have predisposed them to getting cancer at a young age.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Because of that, she said, “we do recommend that all young patients diagnosed under the age of 50 undergo testing for hereditary conditions.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d70c61" class="body-graf"&gt;Overall survival rates for gastrointestinal cancers have gotten better over time, due to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/stomach-cancer-diagnosed-earlier-symptoms-survival-rcna204536" target="_blank"&gt;improvements in treatment and screening&lt;/a&gt;. But Ng’s review found that younger patients often have worse outcomes, despite typically receiving more treatments, including more surgery, radiation and aggressive combinations of chemotherapy, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-1b2210" class="body-graf"&gt;One reason could be that primary care doctors may overlook symptoms such as abdominal pain, constipation, heartburn or reflux in younger patients, thereby delaying their diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4cc69f" class="body-graf"&gt;“My personal feeling is that it’s because we’re finding them at a more advanced stage, because people don’t really think of colon or other GI cancers when they see a young person with these nonspecific complaints,” said Dr. Howard Hochster, director of gastrointestinal oncology at Rutgers Cancer Institute and RWJBarnabas Health in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-732ba8" class="body-graf"&gt;But Ng said that even after controlling for the stage at which patients are diagnosed, young people still seem to have worse survival rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d4322c" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“This makes us wonder as researchers whether that means that the cancers that develop in younger people may be biologically different and more aggressive, or maybe less responsive to treatment,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 15:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxQLTJZa3cwTmZ4TmI5eUJLODJNTTFpbFN6TVNsQXFTSFF2aXQ4UWhsOVdmVjhTd3l4NHV5NGl4LUx5OVQ1ZVA2cnA5OF9aOXFvRDYxdjVwUXhOZzlncUVzY1ljNllRbDhzYXRwNzA0WGVJVEJYZ1U4a2ZyeGRVY0xEMHVLU0FXOW11bnVnWUxlZGpxVkZpTG5aajBhaTlhTURXd1ZfWHZWYWdUZHl00gFWQVVfeXFMTm1qc29YLUpsczRRdTJNRGtPZWV6dkpNTmVpVkRNY2JFZkdZR21FZDVnMUtVdDZyTkdWVVpmOWJvaVRzSkRib3lvS3ZqNGVCaXQ4TTNjX1E</guid></item><item><title>每分钟多走14步可以抵御老年人的虚弱影响-研究发现 | Walking 14 More Steps Per Minute Can Fight Off Frailty Effects For Seniors - Study Finds</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxQRnhuLU44akxJRF9FU2FZUkZKWkduZGFsNHNtWk5HY2I1eXVnckFiVjFHbm9DVllUVmRwakZ1cW10QmlXTHdzTm5IXzk0T1E1T3JiMm5rNVJqZmRNOFRDVWdzNHg0Z1htX3FNd3QwYlFSN2VYLWNfSW05UFJ6Ym9aalREZGRyOGdRR3FTdTUzcXBYVFF2?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;&lt;div class="post-featured-image"&gt;&lt;picture&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increasing walking speed by 14 steps per minute boosted the odds of meaningful functional improvement in older adults with frailty.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Participants who walked “as fast as they safely could” were nearly twice as likely to improve on a standard 6-minute walk test compared to those walking at a casual pace.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;These gains were linked to individual speed increases, not just being in the “intensive” exercise group.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The findings suggest that tracking walking cadence with simple devices can guide personalized exercise plans in senior care.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHICAGO —&lt;/strong&gt; Picking up the pace during a walk might sound like obvious health advice, but for millions of older Americans already showing signs of physical decline, those extra steps per minute could be the difference between maintaining independence and losing it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research tracking 102 &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/seniors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;seniors&lt;/a&gt; in Chicago-area retirement communities reveals that increasing walking speed by just 14 steps per minute during exercise dramatically improves physical function in people &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/frailty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;who are frail &lt;/a&gt;or becoming frail. The four-month study found that 65% of seniors who walked “as fast as they safely could” saw meaningful improvements in their ability to walk longer distances, compared to only 39% of those who stuck to a comfortable, leisurely pace.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For context, this means someone who normally walks at 80 steps per minute and bumps it up to 94 steps per minute could see real improvements in their &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/wellness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;daily physical capacity&lt;/a&gt; — the kind that affects whether they can handle grocery shopping, climb stairs, or maintain their independence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-growing-problem-of-frailty"&gt;The Growing Problem of Frailty&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Frailty affects roughly 15% of Americans over 65 and goes far beyond &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;normal aging&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a medical condition marked by unintentional weight loss, constant exhaustion, muscle weakness, slow movement, and low activity levels. Unlike typical age-related changes, frailty creates a dangerous downward spiral where people become less active, which makes them weaker, which makes them even less active.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This cycle dramatically increases the &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/falling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;risk of falls&lt;/a&gt;, disability, hospitalization, and death. Breaking it has become urgent as America’s population ages rapidly, with researchers scrambling to find interventions that actually work for people who are already physically vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Walking programs have shown promise because they address multiple aspects of frailty at once. But figuring out &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/wellness/exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the right exercise&lt;/a&gt; “prescription,” that is, how often, how long, and how hard people should walk, has been tricky. That’s especially the case for older adults with heart conditions or those taking medications that affect their response to exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Faster walkers saw significant improvements in a 6-minute walking test that is often used for measuring physical function. (Inside Creative House/Shutterstock)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-counting-steps-works-better-than-heart-rate"&gt;Why Counting Steps Works Better Than Heart Rate&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditional ways of measuring exercise intensity often fail older adults. Heart rate monitors become unreliable when people take common medications like &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/beta-blockers-heart-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;beta blockers&lt;/a&gt;, which prevent heart rates from rising normally during exercise. Asking people to rate how hard they’re working on a scale of 1 to 10 also proves unreliable; many seniors struggle to accurately judge their exertion levels.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/steps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Counting steps&lt;/a&gt; per minute offers something much simpler and more objective. Anyone can track this using a smartphone or &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/fitness-trackers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;basic fitness watch&lt;/a&gt;, and previous research shows that hitting 100 steps per minute typically qualifies as moderate-intensity exercise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Chicago study, led by Dr. Daniel Rubin, an associate professor at the University of Chicago, equipped participants with highly accurate accelerometers worn on the thigh throughout each exercise session. These devices recorded every step, allowing researchers to calculate precise &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/walking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; speeds for each person across the entire four-month program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-experiment-fast-walkers-vs-comfortable-pacers"&gt;The Experiment: Fast Walkers vs. Comfortable Pacers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 102 participants, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/older-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;averaging nearly 79 years old&lt;/a&gt;, represented diverse racial and economic backgrounds from 14 retirement communities. The majority (80%) were women, and all showed signs of being frail or prefrail based on standard medical assessments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both groups followed identical schedules: three sessions per week, each lasting 45 minutes with 15 minutes of warm-up and cool-down plus 30 minutes of actual walking. The only difference was in the instructions given to each group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The “casual speed walking” group was told to maintain a “relaxed and comfortable pace.” The “&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/walking-speed-dementia-risk-older-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;high-intensity walking&lt;/a&gt;” group was encouraged to walk “as fast as they safely could.” All sessions were supervised by trained staff who provided standardized encouragement and safety monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the final phase of the program, the results were stark. The high-intensity group averaged 100 steps per minute compared to 77 steps per minute for the casual walkers. More importantly, the faster walkers were far more likely to see meaningful improvements in a standard fitness test called the 6-minute walk test.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 6-minute walk test measures how far someone can walk in six minutes, which is a strong predictor of overall physical function and independence. For frail older adults, improving by 30 meters or more is considered clinically meaningful, representing real-world differences in the ability to complete daily activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When researchers analyzed the data, they found that participants who increased their walking speed by 14 steps per minute from their comfortable baseline had significantly better odds of hitting this improvement threshold. Importantly, when they accounted for individual speed increases, the advantage of being in the “high-intensity” group disappeared entirely, meaning &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/walking-faster-type-2-diabetes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;the speed boost itself&lt;/a&gt;, not just being told to walk faster, drove the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The paper did not report any serious injuries, and participants were allowed to rest as needed during sessions. Those breaks didn’t count toward their 30-minute walking target.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0323759" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLOS One&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, offers immediate practical applications for assisted living facilities, community centers, and &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;healthcare providers&lt;/a&gt; working with older adults. Rather than generic “gentle exercise” programs, facilities could set individualized speed targets based on each person’s comfortable walking pace and use basic activity monitors to track progress toward that 14-step improvement goal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the millions of older Americans facing declining physical function, this research provides both hope and a concrete action plan. Maintaining independence may come down to something as measurable and achievable as adding 14 extra steps per minute &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/walking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;to regular walks&lt;/a&gt; — a remarkably specific target that could help transform how people age in America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers conducted a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial involving 102 prefrail and frail older adults (average age 79) living in 14 retirement communities in the Chicago area. Participants were randomly assigned to either a casual speed walking group or a high-intensity walking group. Both groups completed 48 exercise sessions over 4 months, with three 45-minute sessions per week. Each session included 15 minutes of warm-up and cool-down plus 30 minutes of walking. The casual group was instructed to walk at a comfortable pace, while the high-intensity group was told to walk “as fast as you safely can.” All participants wore thigh-mounted accelerometers during sessions to precisely measure walking cadence (steps per minute). The primary outcome was improvement in 6-minute walk test distance of at least 30 meters, considered clinically meaningful for this population.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Participants in the high-intensity walking group achieved significantly higher walking cadences than the casual walking group (100 vs. 77 steps per minute during the final phase). More importantly, 65% of high-intensity walkers showed meaningful improvements in their 6-minute walk test compared to 39% of casual walkers. The researchers found that increasing walking cadence by 14 steps per minute from baseline comfortable pace significantly increased the odds of achieving functional improvement. When individual cadence changes were accounted for, the group assignment effect disappeared, suggesting that the speed increase itself drove the benefits rather than other aspects of the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted in retirement communities with motivated volunteers who may not represent all frail older adults. All sessions were supervised by research assistants providing standardized encouragement, making it unclear whether unsupervised participants could achieve similar results. The baseline 6-minute walk distance of approximately 250 meters was well below community norms, highlighting the significantly impaired functional capacity of the study population. The authors noted that all participants were volunteers from retirement communities and were likely motivated, raising the possibility of selection bias.&lt;/p&gt;

Using functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy and reinforcement learning tasks, scientists found that high AIC Glx predicted both a general internalizing symptom score and heightened error sensitivity, which mediated this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During reward learning, AIC Glx decreased slightly, indicating dynamic metabolic changes, while the medial prefrontal cortex showed no such effects. These findings suggest that overactive insular glutamatergic signaling amplifies perceived errors, fueling maladaptive thought patterns seen in anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AIC Glutamate:&lt;/strong&gt; Elevated resting glutamate-glutamine levels in the anterior insula correlate with a general dimension of anxiety and depression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Error Sensitivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Heightened AIC Glx increases the tendency to overweight prediction errors, a cognitive bias linked to internalizing symptoms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Changes:&lt;/strong&gt; During gain-based learning, AIC Glx levels decrease slightly, reflecting acute metabolic demands, while medial prefrontal cortex levels remain unchanged.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New research reveals that an overactive anterior insular cortex (AIC), a key hub for integrating emotional and bodily states, may contribute to anxiety and depression by making the brain more sensitive to errors and negative outcomes. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, combining cutting-edge brain spectroscopy and computational modeling, links elevated excitatory signaling in the AIC to a common dimension of internalizing symptoms and highlights how this overactivity shapes how we learn from mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Brain’s Hub for Feelings and Fears&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anterior insula sits deep within the brain’s folds and serves as a critical hub for sensing internal bodily signals, monitoring errors, and integrating emotions into decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111724"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/insula-anxiety-depression-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Treatments that reduce glutamatergic overactivity in the AIC — whether through medications, neuromodulation, or behavioral therapies — may help dampen maladaptive error sensitivity and improve symptoms. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous neuroimaging studies have shown that the AIC is hyperactive in people with anxiety and depression, particularly when processing uncertainty or feedback about mistakes. But why the AIC behaves this way — and how this overactivity might link to the way people with these disorders perceive and respond to errors — has been unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glutamate, the brain’s main excitatory neurotransmitter, plays a central role in learning, plasticity, and emotional regulation. Dysregulation of glutamatergic signaling has been implicated in psychiatric conditions, with evidence that excessive glutamate activity in frontal brain regions heightens stress responses and emotional reactivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could the AIC’s glutamatergic tone explain why some people seem to overreact to errors, reinforcing worry and rumination?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, researchers recruited 56 healthy young adults to undergo functional magnetic resonance spectroscopy (fMRS) — a neuroimaging technique that can measure concentrations of glutamate and its close relative glutamine, often combined as Glx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants also completed questionnaires measuring symptoms of anxiety and depression, which the team distilled into a single “general psychopathology factor” (or G-score) capturing shared internalizing tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Linking Brain Chemistry to Errors and Emotions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside the MRI scanner, participants performed a computerized decision-making task, repeatedly choosing between two options that carried either rewards or losses. The task was designed to test how sensitive participants were to prediction errors — the difference between expected and actual outcomes, which are crucial for learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, single-voxel fMRS scans measured Glx levels in the AIC and in a comparison region, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), both at rest and during the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. Individuals with higher resting Glx in the AIC were more sensitive to prediction errors during the task, both when learning from gains and from losses. They also scored higher on the G-score, indicating greater underlying symptoms of anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, error sensitivity fully explained the link between AIC Glx and the G-score — suggesting that heightened excitatory signaling in the AIC increases error sensitivity, which in turn fuels internalizing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these effects were specific to the AIC: Glx levels in the mPFC were not related to error sensitivity or symptoms. The AIC’s hyperactive glutamatergic state appears to bias individuals toward overestimating mistakes and negative feedback, feeding into the maladaptive thought patterns common in anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Dynamic Changes During Learning&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also revealed dynamic neurochemical changes during the task. As participants engaged in reward-based learning, Glx levels in the AIC decreased slightly — perhaps reflecting the metabolic demands of active learning — and remained low afterward. Interestingly, this task-related reduction was specific to gain learning and did not occur during loss-based learning, nor was it observed in the mPFC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these transient changes did not disrupt the trait-like elevation of Glx in individuals with higher anxiety and depression symptoms. Even after the task, those with higher baseline AIC Glx still showed greater error sensitivity and higher G-scores, suggesting that the acute dips in glutamate during learning are superimposed on a more stable, elevated excitatory tone that biases cognition and emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why Does Error Sensitivity Matter?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Error sensitivity — the tendency to give disproportionate weight to mistakes or negative feedback — is an important cognitive process. In healthy learning, it allows people to adapt and improve their choices. But when excessive, it can lead to rumination, self-criticism, and avoidance, hallmarks of anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that an overactive glutamatergic system in the AIC may amplify how errors are perceived, making each mistake feel more salient and threatening than it should. This overestimation feeds into a cycle of worry and negative mood, providing a mechanistic link between brain chemistry, cognition, and internalizing symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AIC’s unique role in integrating bodily states and emotions may make it especially prone to “tuning up” error signals when excitatory activity is high. While the mPFC is also involved in mood regulation, its neurochemical activity did not show the same dynamic changes or associations with symptoms, underscoring the AIC’s specific contribution to error-related affective processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Toward Better Treatments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These insights have potential clinical implications. Treatments that reduce glutamatergic overactivity in the AIC — whether through medications, neuromodulation, or behavioral therapies — may help dampen maladaptive error sensitivity and improve symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, some antidepressants and experimental glutamate-modulating drugs may exert their effects in part by normalizing insular glutamate signaling. Similarly, real-time fMRI neurofeedback training that teaches patients to downregulate AIC activity could help reduce error overestimation and worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also exemplifies the value of combining computational models of cognition with neuroimaging and advanced psychometric analysis. By measuring how people learn from feedback, how their brain chemistry shifts during the task, and how these patterns relate to general psychopathology, the researchers have uncovered a specific pathway by which brain chemistry may translate into maladaptive emotion and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Limitations and Future Directions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like all studies, this one has limitations. The sample was relatively small and limited to young, healthy adults, so the findings need to be replicated in larger and more diverse clinical populations. The cross-sectional design means that causal relationships cannot be firmly established; it’s possible that chronic anxiety and depression also alter insular glutamate levels over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the loss block always preceded the gain block, which may have influenced task-related Glx dynamics. Future studies could counterbalance block order and test longitudinal interventions aimed at modulating AIC glutamate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the findings strengthen the case for targeting insular glutamatergic signaling as a novel strategy to alleviate anxiety and depression, particularly in patients who exhibit heightened sensitivity to mistakes and negative feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The anterior insula’s hyperactive glutamatergic system appears to heighten how strongly we feel and react to errors, fueling the worry and rumination that characterize anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By uncovering this specific neurochemical pathway, the study provides a clearer picture of how brain chemistry, cognition, and emotion interact — and opens new avenues for treatments that can restore balance to this overactive error-monitoring system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one of the study’s key messages suggests: by quieting the insula’s overexcited error signals, we may help quiet the mind itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this depression, neuroscience, and anxiety research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News Communications – Neuroscience News&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2025.1592015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Anterior insular cortex glutamate-glutamine (Glx) levels predict general psychopathology via heightened error sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;” by Bumseok Jeong et al. &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anterior insular cortex glutamate-glutamine (Glx) levels predict general psychopathology via heightened error sensitivity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction:&lt;/strong&gt; The anterior insular cortex (AIC) integrates interoceptive, cognitive-emotional, and error-monitoring signals, and is consistently hyperactive in anxiety and depression. Converging evidence links elevated glutamate + glutamine (Glx) in fronto-insular regions to stress reactivity; however, it is unknown whether AIC Glx relates to a transdiagnostic general psychopathology factor (G-score) or to the tendency to overweight prediction errors during learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We therefore combined functional MRS (fMRS) with reinforcement-learning modeling to test whether (i) baseline AIC Glx predicts the G-score derived from bifactor analysis of PHQ-9, GAD-7, and STAI-X1, and (ii) task-evoked Glx changes track individual differences in error sensitivity during gain- and loss-based learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt; Fifty-six healthy adults (22 ± 2 yr, 16 women) completed the questionnaires and performed a two-armed bandit task (40 loss then 40 gain trials) while single-voxel semi-LASER spectra were acquired from AIC and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) at rest and during each block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six Rescorla-Wagner variants were fitted to the choices; the best model (based on the lowest LOOIC) included error sensitivity, decision temperature, and value decay. Glx (CRLB &amp;lt; 20%) was quantified using LCModel and analyzed with repeated-measures ANOVA and Bonferroni-corrected correlations; mediation was assessed using Baron-Kenny steps (α = 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; Baseline AIC Glx correlated with the G-score (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.39, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.004) and with error sensitivity for gains and losses (&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;≈0.41–0.44, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; ≤ 0.005); mPFC Glx showed no such relations. AIC Glx fell during gain learning (−2.21%, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.034) and remained low post-task, whereas mPFC Glx was unchanged. Error sensitivity fully mediated the AIC-Glx/G-score link; associations were specific to Glx, not other metabolites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion:&lt;/strong&gt; Higher excitatory tone in the AIC appears to enlarge prediction-error weighting, which in turn amplifies a shared anxiety-depression dimension. Dynamic Glx reductions during reward learning suggest acute metabolic demand superimposed on a trait-like baseline that biaes cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Targeting insular glutamatergic function–pharmacologically or via neuromodulation–may therefore mitigate maladaptive error processing that underlies internalizing psychopathology.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 13:58:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTFA3OWdkenM2SEwzbnNraWp0blFuWEEyTUF5cm0tSGdwZzFiLUtPYXduY1JWUWg3U3BhVEZxMlZPLTl2emltQ1JBcmczQ251NVVXbEhzQ2RoZVVZTzRMdzRra05SOU5tMmlmbGZkN2t3</guid></item><item><title>7月，麻疹感染儿童前往北泽西州的9个地点：请参阅列表-补丁 | Measles-Infected Child Went To 9 North Jersey Locations In July: See The List - Patch</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="styles_Section__card__4Uoov"&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;BERGEN COUNTY, NJ — A Hudson County child with measles — a highly contagious and sometimes fatal virus — visited various spots in Bergen, Essex, and Hudson counties since July 4, including a mall and two restaurants, New Jersey officials said. They are urging people who visited the same locations to watch for symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state has announced such cases so that the public can get treated early if they have the disease.

Because the disease is so contagious it requires at least 95 percent of a local population to be vaccinated in order to prevent its spread, health officials say. New Jersey's vaccination level recently dropped to 92 percent, &lt;a href="https://patch.com/new-jersey/ridgewood/measles-update-nj-state-says-3-cases-were-1-household-more"&gt;an official said.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visited Emergency Rooms Starting July 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="ContentBlocks_CardDetail__SubscribeBlock__4zBcQ ContentBlocks_CardDetail__SubscribeBlock--desktop__oN6vv"&gt;&lt;section class="styles_SubscribeForm__0dj5n"&gt;&lt;h2 class="styles_SubscribeForm__title__F_olP"&gt;Find out what's happening in Hoboken&lt;span class="styles_SubscribeForm__title--nextLine__FTO3K"&gt;for free with the latest updates from Patch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state health department said Tuesday, "The New Jersey Department of Health is alerting residents about a confirmed case of measles. &lt;br&gt;Individuals – especially parents, guardians, health care providers, and caregivers – are urged to be aware of the symptoms of this highly contagious virus and to ensure they are up to date with the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) shots.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The single confirmed case is a resident of Hudson County and it is not known to be related to the Ocean County measles case reported last week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child in question apparently was brought to two hospitals on July 4 and 5, then was released.

The findings raise important questions about the role of infections in mental health, violence, and personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurochemical Manipulation:&lt;/strong&gt; Parasites like &lt;em&gt;T. gondii&lt;/em&gt; increase dopamine production in the brain, influencing risk-taking and impulsivity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Infected individuals may exhibit more aggression, impulsive decisions, and even heightened sexual risk behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Public Health Relevance:&lt;/strong&gt; Up to 80% of older humans may carry &lt;em&gt;T. gondii&lt;/em&gt;, underscoring the widespread potential for subtle behavioral influence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parasitic infections aren’t just a public health and hygiene concern—they could also shape how we think, feel, and act. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing body of research highlights how certain parasites, such as &lt;em&gt;Toxoplasma gondii&lt;/em&gt;, may subtly manipulate their host’s brain and behavior in ways that benefit the parasite’s survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications reach beyond individual health, suggesting that widespread infections could even influence societal trends in aggression, risk-taking, and mental health disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111720"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/t-gondii-personality-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Infections with parasites that form cysts in the brain may disrupt key circuits in emotion and decision-making, raising risks of disorders like schizophrenia, depression, or even suicidal behavior. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new synthesis of evidence reviews how parasites hijack the nervous system and immune pathways to change behavior. Among the most notorious is &lt;em&gt;T. gondii&lt;/em&gt;, a protozoan carried by cats that infects up to 80% of older humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In animals, it famously removes rodents’ fear of cats—its definitive host—so it can complete its life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In humans, evidence suggests it alters dopamine balance, promotes impulsivity, raises aggression, and may even elevate sexual risk-taking and violent tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other parasites, like &lt;em&gt;Trypanosoma brucei&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Bartonella henselae&lt;/em&gt;, and malaria-causing &lt;em&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/em&gt;, also appear to spark behavioral and neuropsychiatric changes in their hosts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are now unraveling the biochemical and neuroimmune mechanisms behind these effects. &lt;em&gt;T. gondii&lt;/em&gt;, for example, directly increases dopamine production in infected neurons by expressing its own tyrosine hydroxylase, a key enzyme in dopamine synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This increase in dopamine, along with immunomodulatory effects on brain inflammation, likely contributes to the impulsivity, risk-taking, and even sexually aggressive behaviors reported in some infected individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infections with parasites that form cysts in the brain may disrupt key circuits in emotion and decision-making, raising risks of disorders like schizophrenia, depression, or even suicidal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While research into the societal and individual impacts of these behavioral shifts is still in its infancy, the findings are provocative. They suggest that parasitic infections—often thought of as minor or asymptomatic—can have lasting effects on personality and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For public health and psychology, these insights open new avenues: increasing awareness of transmission risks (like handling raw meat or cat litter), developing vaccines or therapies that target these effects, and even rethinking the role of infections in aggression and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the next time we think about what drives risky, impulsive, or violent behavior, we may need to consider not just nature and nurture, but the possibility of parasites shaping our minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience and personality research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://neurosciencenews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Neuroscience News Communications – Neuroscience News&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1555024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sexually aggressive behavior triggered by parasitic infection – how parasites can influence our personality&lt;/a&gt;” by Marco Goczol. &lt;em&gt;Frontiers in Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sexually aggressive behavior triggered by parasitic infection – how parasites can influence our personality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parasitic infections are not only a health problem, but also a psychological and behavioral one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that certain parasites can influence the personality traits and behavior of infected individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toxoplasma gondii, a well-known parasite, is suspected of increasing the risk of sexually aggressive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paper examines the links between parasitic infections and personality changes and analyzes the mechanisms by which parasites can affect the nervous system and associated behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aim is to raise awareness of the psychological and behavioral effects of parasitic infections and to stimulate future research in this area.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 13:12:03 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE9fSTRZdDNxQlRUbXN0Tm1YQmowbXhTYnNJVVJETXN0RHdBRjRjOS1sQXRWOGtMYVliN0ZtUjF4WnlfcmVXMlRSdWxlZWVEVFpNYml5QmZKcVRBWFVJZWl3VTQ5SHVQSExPdDlBc0pGZw</guid></item><item><title>瑜伽休息冥想减轻压力并重塑皮质醇节律，研究发现- PsyPost | Yoga nidra meditation reduces stress and reshapes cortisol rhythms, study finds - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxPZnZJR1BEaFRFLXk5S1RtQXBha2xITm05bGFvWklVSHoya0NHYWJxb1NTS3VjWW54LWxZWFJQWWVDXzF5aHBmSUxfUmtxTzdYcUxVQmttclJYeTdFVGJ6a3NpdEZoTW1yUlNDMWFsNFA3ZURfWEhrNW9hV0xSdnFhcWNpNDI1SEt5cmI5eXdkc2x5M1ZqUlpBS09rVDNaN2FBb3gyMUFn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study finds that practicing a guided meditation known as yoga nidra can reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. The research, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/smi.70049" target="_blank"&gt;Stress and Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, also shows that even short, 11-minute daily sessions can produce measurable changes in the body’s primary stress hormone, while longer 30-minute sessions may offer additional benefits for mindfulness and physiological regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yoga nidra, sometimes called “yogic sleep,” is a guided meditation technique that brings practitioners into a deeply relaxed state while remaining conscious. The practice typically involves lying down, slowing the breath, setting intentions, and moving through stages of body awareness and imagery. In recent years, it has gained popularity under the label “non-sleep deep rest” and has been studied for its effects on emotional regulation, sleep, and anxiety. Although past studies suggested psychological benefits, researchers wanted to determine whether yoga nidra could also change physiological markers of stress, like cortisol, especially in a large, well-controlled study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I practice yoga nidra myself almost daily and find it incredibly helpful—not only for calming down, but also for gaining clarity and creative ideas through that short, conscious pause,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.psychologie-im-inntal.de/" target="_blank"&gt;Esther N. Moszeik&lt;/a&gt;, a research associate at &lt;a href="https://www.unibw.de/hum-psychologie/ppd/personen/moszeik" target="_blank"&gt;the University of the Bundeswehr Munich&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In a previous study, we had already found that even 11 minutes of yoga nidra improved subjective sleep quality and mood. This follow-up study was designed to go one step further: we included biological stress markers, compared two yoga nidra formats, and added an active control group with music to better isolate the effects. I was also curious whether individual personality traits might influence who benefits most from which version—and how we find better matches between people and interventions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on cortisol, the body’s main stress hormone. The natural daily rhythm of cortisol, including a sharp rise upon waking and a gradual decline throughout the day, is a key indicator of the body’s stress response system. Deviations from this pattern have been linked to chronic stress and mental health issues. The research team set out to determine if yoga nidra could help regulate this biological rhythm and improve psychological well-being at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate these questions, the researchers conducted an online randomized controlled trial. They recruited a large sample of 362 German-speaking adults and randomly assigned them to one of four groups. The first experimental group practiced an 11-minute version of yoga nidra. The second experimental group practiced a longer, 30-minute version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see if yoga nidra had unique effects beyond simple relaxation, a third group served as an active control, listening to 10 minutes of calming instrumental music. A fourth group was a waitlist control, receiving no intervention during the study period, which served as a baseline for comparison. Participants in the intervention groups were asked to engage in their assigned practice, ideally daily, for two months using pre-recorded audio files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure the effects, all participants completed a series of online questionnaires before the intervention began, immediately after the two-month period, and again at a three-month follow-up to assess any lasting changes. These questionnaires measured perceived stress, symptoms of anxiety and depression, the tendency to ruminate on negative thoughts, overall satisfaction with life, and sleep quality. They also assessed five different facets of mindfulness, such as the ability to act with awareness and accept thoughts without judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, a subset of 229 participants provided saliva samples to measure their cortisol levels. They collected five samples at specific times over two consecutive days, which allowed the researchers to map each person’s daily cortisol pattern, including the morning rise and the slope of decline throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study revealed that both forms of yoga nidra had a positive impact on mental health. When compared to the waitlist control group, the 11-minute yoga nidra practice led to reductions in stress, anxiety, depression, and rumination. Participants in this group also reported an increase in their satisfaction with life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While these effects were statistically significant, they were small in size, representing improvements of about 8% to 16% of a standard deviation. However, even small effects can be meaningful when they come from a low-cost, easily accessible intervention. When compared against the active control group that listened to music, the 11-minute yoga nidra practice showed a distinct advantage in one area: it significantly reduced symptoms of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One surprise was that even the brief 11-minute meditation produced noticeable benefits – we often assume longer is better, but the short daily practice made a difference,” Moszeik told PsyPost. “We also found hints that not everyone responds in the same way: certain personality traits seemed to amplify the benefits of the meditation: for example, very conscientious individuals showed bigger gains than others and people high in neuroticism appeared to benefit especially strongly from the longer, 30-minute sessions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When comparing the two lengths of yoga nidra, the researchers found that the 30-minute version was not universally superior to the 11-minute one. The main difference was that the longer practice led to a greater increase in one specific facet of mindfulness known as “acting with awareness.” This refers to the ability to remain focused on one’s present actions and be less easily distracted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the 30-minute practice did show broader benefits when compared to the control groups. For example, when compared to the waitlist group, the 30-minute session produced significant reductions in stress, anxiety, depression, rumination, and sleep disturbances. It also produced a noteworthy biological change: it resulted in a flatter cortisol awakening response. This means the typical sharp spike of the stress hormone in the morning was less pronounced, suggesting a more relaxed start to the day and less anticipatory stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For participants in the 11-minute group, practicing more frequently was associated with changes in their cortisol patterns. Regular practice was linked to a reduction in total cortisol output throughout the day and a steeper decline in the hormone from morning to evening, a pattern generally associated with better health and well-being. This suggests that consistency is a key component for achieving biological benefits, even with a very short practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the 30-minute group, more frequent practice was associated with reduced rumination and increased mindfulness, but it was also linked to a higher cortisol awakening response. The researchers speculate that for those engaging in longer, more regular practice, the meditation may transition from being primarily relaxing to being more energizing or activating over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The main takeaway is that a simple daily relaxation practice like yoga nidra can have real, measurable benefits for your well-being,” Moszeik said. “We observed small but meaningful improvements in stress and mood for people who practiced yoga nidra compared to those who didn’t, and even their cortisol (a key stress hormone) showed a healthier daily rhythm. It’s important to know that cortisol isn’t purely ‘bad’ – in fact, we need it to wake up and get energized – but chronic stress can throw its cycle out of balance. Our findings suggest that taking just a few minutes to deeply relax each day helps keep your cortisol levels in a better balance over the day, which is linked to feeling calmer and more resilient.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has several strengths, including its large and diverse sample, the use of a randomized controlled design with an active control group, and the inclusion of a biological marker for stress. Administering the intervention online also demonstrates its potential for widespread, low-cost implementation. However, the study also has some limitations. The online format meant that participants did not receive personal guidance or support, which can be an important part of learning a new meditation practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The improvements we saw were statistically significant but quite small in magnitude,” Moszeik noted. “In other words, yoga nidra isn’t a quick fix or miracle cure – it’s more like a gentle and steady nudge toward feeling better. Another limitation is that our study relied on participants practicing on their own at home, so we had to trust their self-reports about how often and how well they did the meditation. We also mainly studied healthy adults who were interested enough to sign up for a meditation trial, which means the results might not generalize to everyone. Finally, while we did include a follow-up, we only tracked outcomes for a few months, so we don’t yet know how durable these effects are in the long run.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the research team aims to build on these findings by exploring how to personalize these kinds of interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results hinted that factors like personality could moderate how much someone benefits, so one next step is to figure out which types of people respond best to which techniques,” Moszeik explained. “For instance, maybe some individuals thrive with a short daily practice while others need a longer session or a different kind of meditation – understanding those differences can help tailor stress-management programs to the person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re also interested in seeing what happens if people continue practicing yoga nidra beyond two months: Do the benefits accumulate or reach a plateau? And do these changes in cortisol and well-being translate into tangible health outcomes (like better sleep, focus, or fewer stress-related symptoms) over time? Ultimately, our goal is to make mind-body interventions like this as effective and accessible as possible, by learning how to match the right practice to the right person.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I’d add that it was encouraging to see both the short and long versions of yoga nidra have benefits, which means people can choose what fits their schedule and still gain something,” Moszeik said. “Even a brief 11-minute daily routine was enough to improve some mental health measures, especially for parents, people in leadership positions, and older men. On the other hand, the 30-minute version did provide a bit of an extra boost in certain areas – for example, it seemed to further calm the spike of cortisol we normally get after waking up in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So, there’s flexibility: you don’t necessarily need a huge time commitment to help manage stress, but if you can set aside a bit longer, you might see additional advantages. Overall, we hope this study shows that taking time out for deep relaxation isn’t just a nice indulgence – it’s a practical tool that can make a positive difference in your daily life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/smi.70049" target="_blank"&gt;The Effects of an Online Yoga Nidra Meditation on Subjective Well-Being and Diurnal Salivary Cortisol: A Randomised Controlled Trial&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Esther N.

It also had an impact on her social life because she was worried someone might bump into her shoulder and cause her pain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Frozen shoulder, which causes pain and stiffness often brought on by an injury, can persist for months (sometimes years) and make everyday activities difficult&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Frozen shoulder, also known as adhesive capsulitis, affects around a million people a year in the UK and occurs when the capsule of tissue that surrounds the shoulder joint becomes inflamed and thickens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The capsule is usually large enough to allow for a full range of motion in a normal shoulder,' says Rajeev Sharma, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon in private clinics across London and Hertfordshire, who specialises in shoulder, elbow and hand surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'With an inflamed condition such as frozen shoulder, the capsule thickens - and as a result the space for movement also reduces, which is the main cause for the stiffness.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some people also develop neck pain as the stiffness in the shoulder joint may mean muscles in the neck overcompensate for the lack of motion in the shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Often caused by injury 'such as a fall or even a minor stretch such as reaching for something in the back of a car', Mr Sharma says a frozen shoulder is also more common if you have diabetes. The theory is that persistently high blood sugar can make the surrounding shoulder tissue thicker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he adds it is women in the 40 to 60 age bracket - the age at which most women go through the menopause - who are most at risk of the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The question is, why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research has suggested a link to the drop in oestrogen that occurs around menopause to an increased risk of frozen shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Rajeev Sharma, a consultant orthopaedic surgeon, says that women in their 40s to 60s - the age at which they go through the menopause - are most at risk of suffering from frozen shoulder&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A study by Duke University in the US, involving 1,952 women - of which 152 were taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) normally given to make up for the drop in oestrogen that occurs during menopause - found that patients who were not taking HRT were 99 per cent more likely to develop a frozen shoulder compared to those receiving HRT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The results, published in the Orthopaedic Journal of Sports Medicine in 2023 make sense, says Dr Elise Dallas, a menopause specialist at The London General Practice, as oestrogen 'plays several important roles in musculoskeletal health'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Oestrogen has anti-inflammatory properties and supports bone growth, as well as connective tissue health,' she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As oestrogen levels drop during menopause, collagen (an integral part of the connective tissue that forms the muscles, ligaments and tendons) can become stiffer, reducing the flexibility of joints, including the shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The fall in oestrogen levels also leads to an increase in levels of cytokines, compounds which can trigger inflammation in the shoulder joint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This inflammation can cause pain, thickening of the ligaments, and tightening of the joint capsule - hallmarks of frozen shoulder,' says Dr Dallas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, others argue that one study is not enough proof that the hormonal change that occurs during menopause is to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Sharma says that as women aged 40-60 years account for most frozen shoulder patients, the condition 'will often get correlated with menopause, even though there is no direct link to the hormonal changes of menopause'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Currently, as it is there is no 'cure' for frozen shoulder but treatments can help improve symptoms while the healing process takes place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common, says Mr Sharma, is hydrodistension or hydro-dilatation, where a combination of saline, local anaesthetic and a steroid is injected into the joint capsule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The steroid helps in reducing the symptoms of the pain and the high volume of saline attempts to relax the capsule for increased mobility of the shoulder joint,' says Mr Sharma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Physiotherapy and exercise can help maintain shoulder strength - 'though sometimes exercises and physiotherapy can cause more pain when the frozen shoulder is in its initial and aggressive phase,' he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Emma tried physiotherapy and home remedies such as ice, wheat bags (small sacks that you heat up in the microwave), massages, a massage gun and 'every type of painkiller', which all helped short term, 'but sometimes the pain was horrendous'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Even sitting to relax and watch TV was painful. I had to prop my left arm on a cushion because I couldn't let it drop to one side as it was too painful.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In severe cases patients may need an MRI scan to confirm diagnosis. Then a hydrocortisone injection. Mr Sharma says steroid injections 'help reduce inflammation and provide pain relief while the condition resolves itself naturally and can make the recovery journey more comfortable'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Emma's GP initially refused to refer her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then fate intervened just before Christmas in 2023 when Emma fell, injuring her shoulder. She was given an X-ray and MRI in A&amp;amp;E, which confirmed her frozen shoulder diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The doctor said they see many women of my age with it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Emma was referred a specialist at Kingston Hospital for a hydrocortisone injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She had the injection in January last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I must admit, I've never felt pain like it,' says Emma. 'It was excruciating.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But within a week she felt some improvement and over the course of the next couple of months, her shoulder got progressively better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She went on holiday with her partner Stuart, 57, to Indonesia and Singapore, where as it happens, 'they refer to frozen shoulder as "50s shoulder" – clearly they have a better awareness of the link to menopause', says Emma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A year on, the mobility in Emma's shoulder has improved dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My shoulder mobility is now around 97 per cent and although I find it too painful to do something like play tennis, which I used to do two or three times a week, I'm mostly back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm doing three or four aqua aerobic sessions each week to help it improve further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I just want more women to know that if they start experiencing shoulder pain around this stage of life, it's worth seeking medical advice sooner rather than later.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="181" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6dkwz600153b77cw3bpnsz@published"&gt;Your boss does seem to have a real illness, but it has nothing to do with moles. I can’t diagnose him through a letter, but you might be right that he has hypochondria. Also known as intense health anxiety, it is a form of mental illness that can be disruptive and dangerous, but treatable. Two main syndromes are defined in psychiatry’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554399/"&gt;illness anxiety disorder&lt;/a&gt;, or excessive fear of developing a medical condition, and &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532253/"&gt;somatic symptom disorder,&lt;/a&gt; which involves excessive concern about physical symptoms. The COVID pandemic&lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/mentalhealth/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmen.0000120"&gt; exacerbated many people’s health anxiety&lt;/a&gt;. (Masking at work isn’t necessarily a sign of hypochondria, though; dangerous respiratory diseases are still circulating.) The availability of Dr. Google has created a new twist on hypochondria called “&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29324396/"&gt;cyberchondria&lt;/a&gt;,” or excessive searching for medical information. You aren’t your boss’s psychiatrist, and this (among other things!) is definitely not your job, but you or one of your colleagues could tell him that intense worry about health is getting more &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-hypochondria-can-be-deadly-and-how-newer-treatments-help/"&gt;medical attention as a common and treatable problem&lt;/a&gt;—and potentially nudge him toward seeking help.&lt;/p&gt;

You could tell him that you’re simply too busy with your actual work to help search for medical information. You could say that it’s inefficient for you to do these searches since you aren’t experiencing the symptoms yourself and wouldn’t know what to follow up on. Or try the privacy approach: His perceived symptoms might lead to a diagnosis he wouldn’t want to share, and out of respect for his privacy, you don’t think it’s appropriate for you to dig into the medical literature. There’s also the “this is too serious for me” option: “I don’t feel qualified to evaluate and discuss information about health conditions, but the doctors covered by our employer’s insurance can help.”&lt;/p&gt;

I have been told I’ll receive a severance package, but I’ve had a few potential employers express interest in me. I don’t want to leave my already understaffed store without the help they need, but I know I need to protect myself in an uncertain job market. Nothing has been offered directly to me yet, but I’m very tempted by one potential employer. The employer I’m interested in knows my current employer well, and I’m scared my current employer will find out I’m on the hunt and fire me preemptively. He’s known for making snap decisions. How do I know when/if to jump ship?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="125" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2qqy001z3b7704k8qrtt@published"&gt;Your current employer did the right thing by admitting that the company is going out of business. And they are right to offer severance to reward people who stay until the end. Did they tell you how much severance? If it’s, say, three months’ worth of your salary or more, it would probably make financial sense to stay. You could use the severance-funded time to do a thorough job search, and maybe take some time off between jobs. But if they’re being vague about the amount, or if you’re worried the severance could disappear when the company does, don’t let it tie you to a doomed employer. Companies fire people all the time for their own reasons; you have every right to quit for yours.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="155" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2qr000203b77j3448qbt@published"&gt;It sounds like you need more information, and I think it’s worth the risk to have honest-ish conversations with both your current and potential employers. I suggest you start with the latter. Tell them you feel a sense of loyalty to your existing team. (Taking your job seriously makes you even more attractive as a potential hire.) Follow up by saying that you admire the future employer’s work and are intrigued by the possibility of joining them. It’s usually a good idea in a job interview (or pre-interview) to express enthusiasm for the future employer, which explains why you’re talking with them despite your loyalty to your current job. Say explicitly that you would like to keep this conversation confidential for now since you’re not actively looking for work. A potential employer should never share hiring conversations, period, but people are lousy at secrets, and it’s reasonable to confirm that they won’t mention it elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

Are they open about their timeline for hiring you? If they do make an offer and want you to start right away, you could use your dilemma during negotiations. Mention that you would be giving up a severance package if you leave your other job before the end of the year … but if there’s room to increase their salary offer, that would make your decision easier.&lt;/p&gt;

Tell your boss you appreciate his honesty about the company going out of business. Say you’d like to stay to the end, and you have not been looking for a job, but you have been approached by potential future employers. If Mr. Snap Decisions looks like he’s about to blow a gasket, backtrack by telling him you just thought he deserved to know that competitors are taking an interest in his employees, and cut the conversation short.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="116" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2qr400233b77jtf1tt3d@published"&gt;But assuming your current employer doesn’t want to lose you, this would be a natural time to ask for more information about the severance package, and to get it in writing. The company is understaffed, and closing down a business is complicated, so there might be opportunities for you to take on interesting new responsibilities and develop different skills. Tell your boss you’re hoping to make the most of the next few months in the job and you’d like to find out more about what you can contribute. You might even be able to get a new title by the end that could help you get a job at the next level, wherever you land next.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="63" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2xib002g3b77qn4qbs6a@published"&gt;I’ve finally managed to escape a toxic and dangerous work environment that caused a lot of overall stress and harm to my overall well-being. I was offered a new job, and I am two weeks in. It is in the realm of what I want to be doing. My stress levels aren’t as high, and I don’t fear working in an unsafe environment.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="70" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2xib002h3b77p029oz9b@published"&gt;However, there’s a downside. I am struggling with feeling as though I’ve become a babysitter to the older residents who are residing there while receiving medical care. That is not part of the job description. They have aides, they are just not always present in the areas where I am assigned, but the aides should be around at all times due to the fall risks of some of the residents.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2xic002i3b77lw85vfj2@published"&gt;Well, the inevitable happened. An unmonitored resident fell while I was leading a program. I felt awful. They couldn’t speak to answer questions, which made matters worse. English is also not their first language. I spent my entire day off ruminating on what happened and thinking about whether I should be working here. I never received a reply or feedback from my supervisor after I messaged them about what happened. Any advice? I know looking for another workplace is a great solution, but it took me a year to land this job.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="82" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2xic002l3b770j610v2i@published"&gt;Congratulations on getting out of your terrible last job and finding this new one. The learning curve for any new job can be steep and unsettling. It’s natural to ruminate on work problems, especially at the start. Give yourself time to understand the workplace better, and give yourself grace to know you’re doing your best in an imperfect environment. Be patient with yourself and your co-workers as you learn this new job while still recovering from the trauma of the old one.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="161" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2xid002m3b77lrj77qfg@published"&gt;As a new hire, you’ll naturally have a lot of questions. Ask your supervisor for a check-in after your first few weeks. Don’t mention their lack of response to your message; your supervisor might have too many messages to monitor, and you don’t want to set them up to be defensive. Instead, say you want to make sure you understand your responsibilities and proper procedures. Among other things, you want to know how you can help protect the residents if they’re unaccompanied. (Avoid the word “babysitter,” which sounds disrespectful.) If their aides aren’t present, should you alert your supervisor? Or the aides’ supervisor? Go seek the aides out yourself? Or should you monitor residents when they’re participating in one of your programs? If this responsibility wasn’t in your job description, well, job descriptions are often incomplete, and you need to know what’s really expected of you before you make any decisions about whether to stay, go, or stay and fix it.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="46" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmd6f2xif002n3b778yq5jume@published"&gt;If the residents aren’t being cared for properly, the problem could be a poor policy, imperfect enforcement of good policies, or a lack of awareness about the policies. In any of these cases, you might be noticing problems with your fresh eyes that long-time employees overlook.&lt;/p&gt;

Yaranov said he spends "a long time indoors," which can contribute to vitamin D deficiency. When he learned his levels were low, he added vitamin D to his list of daily supplements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognitive impairment is increasing globally. All stages of dementia are marked by declines in memory and executive function. Previous research has examined whether micronutrient levels may relate to cognitive resilience.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                &lt;p class="w-100 my-4 d-print-none"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Copper is an essential trace element that participates in neuronal energy metabolism, neurotransmitter synthesis, and antioxidant regulation. Previous studies have proposed both protective and harmful roles for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/copper/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;copper&lt;/a&gt; in neurodegenerative disease, depending on its bioavailability and concentration in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neural+tissue/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neural tissue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Association between dietary copper intake and cognitive function in American older adults," &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-09280-9" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/i&gt;, researchers designed a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cross-sectional+analysis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cross-sectional analysis&lt;/a&gt; to evaluate the relationship between dietary copper consumption and cognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cohort of 2,420 participants aged 60 years or older was selected from the 2011–2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). All participants had complete data on &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dietary+intake/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dietary intake&lt;/a&gt; and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dietary copper intake was derived from two averaged 24-hour dietary recalls. Cognitive function was measured using four instruments: the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), the Animal Fluency Test (AFT), the immediate and delayed recall subtests of the CERAD protocol, and a composite Z score reflecting global cognition. Copper intake was stratified into quartiles.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Multivariate linear regression models were used to test associations. In the fully adjusted model, participants in the highest copper intake quartile (Q4, ≥1.44 mg/day) had higher scores than those in the lowest quartile (Q1, &amp;lt;0.76 mg/day): DSST (β=3.80, 95% CI 1.90, 5.70), AFT (β=1.23, 95% CI 0.48, 1.99), CERAD-DRT (β=0.47, 95% CI 0.15, 0.80), and Z score (β=0.20, 95% CI 0.10, 0.29). No statistically significant association with CERAD-IRT was found in the fully adjusted model (β=0.58, 95% CI −0.06, 1.22).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants in the higher copper intake quartiles were more likely to be male, non-Hispanic white, married, and higher income, with lower smoking prevalence and more favorable nutritional profiles, including higher intake of zinc, iron, selenium, and total energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spline-based regression modeling showed an inverted L-shaped association between copper intake and DSST, AFT, and Z score. Cognitive test performance improved with copper intake up to thresholds of 1.63 mg/day (DSST), 1.42 mg/day (AFT), and 1.22 mg/day (Z score).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond these thresholds, associations with DSST, AFT, and Z score lost statistical significance, showing near zero change and wide confidence intervals..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants with a history of stroke showed a stronger association between copper intake and global cognition. In this subgroup, Q4 intake was associated with a higher Z score than Q1 (β=0.55, 95% CI 0.24, 0.86; p for interaction=0.009). No significant interaction effects were observed for other demographic or clinical variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authors conclude that copper intake was associated with better cognitive function test scores in older adults. Associations were strongest at moderate intake levels and most pronounced in individuals with prior stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the precise mechanisms underlying the relationship between dietary copper intake and cognitive function remain unknown, the authors state that the findings "… are considered biologically plausible. Dietary copper is crucial for brain health and may confer protective effects on cognitive function through its involvement in antioxidant defense, neurotransmitter synthesis, and energy metabolism."&lt;/p&gt;

He’s not had the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, which isn’t recommended until age 1. When Martin has to return to work, her husband will need to take several unpaid days off to stay home with the boy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f13e9b" class="body-graf"&gt;“It just makes me so mad that this is happening,” said Martin, 26, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. “It’s scary because my son is not protected, and I’m having to worry about child care and my job and my husband’s job.” In these situations, the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/infection-control/hcp/measles/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends&lt;/a&gt; quarantine for 28 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-06fcbd" class="body-graf"&gt;Because he’s too young for the measles vaccine, Hal needed emergency shots of immunoglobulin, or IG, an antibody that helps the immune system fight off infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-76da3c" class="body-graf"&gt;At this point, Martin said, “it’s just a waiting game.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-4c2628" class="body-graf"&gt;Her family’s worry and frustration are playing out in households nationwide as the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-cases-reach-highest-point-disease-was-eliminated-us-2000-rcna201421" target="_blank"&gt;number of measles cases has surpassed a level&lt;/a&gt; not seen since the highly contagious virus was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a759e8" class="body-graf"&gt;On Wednesday, the CDC reported &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;1,309 cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; in 39 states. The vast majority of patients are children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e7f320" class="body-graf"&gt;Each of those cases has had the opportunity to expose hundreds or even thousands of other people, especially kids, either too young to be vaccinated, like Hal, or children with weak immune systems, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-af4654" class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Ana Montanez, a pediatrician at Texas Tech Physicians in Lubbock, Texas, cared for many families during the recent &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreak-west-texas-grows-unvaccinated-rcna192163" target="_blank"&gt;measles outbreak in West Texas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e41b0b" class="body-graf"&gt;"A lot of our families, hard-working families, typically don't have a month's savings of salary to stay home, yet they have to," Montanez said. "Oftentimes it's not just one job, but two, maybe three."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd465b" class="body-graf"&gt;Cedar Rapids isn’t experiencing an outbreak of measles. Just &lt;a href="https://www.linncountyiowa.gov/1777/Measles#" target="_blank"&gt;seven cases have been confirmed&lt;/a&gt; across Iowa in 2025, according to the latest data in the state. They are the first reported measles cases in Iowa since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6d63eb" class="body-graf"&gt;Still, the Martin family’s situation illustrates the ripple effects of a single exposure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-b56e5e" class="body-graf"&gt;“What’s happening in our town is a perfect example of why vaccination is important,” said Dr. Dustin Arnold, chief medical officer at UnityPoint Health-Cedar Rapids. “It just takes one” measles case, he said, to set off waves of impact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-035921" class="body-graf"&gt;On Saturday, Arnold ran a command center giving out immunoglobulin, or IG shots for eight babies who were exposed to measles at the same day care as Hal. Three others were sent to a nearby medical facility for the same treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-052e01" class="body-graf"&gt;IG injections can be given up to six days after exposure to measles. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8675579/" target="_blank"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt; found that the therapy is highly effective in protecting exposed newborns from getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-205a8a" class="body-graf"&gt;IG treatments aren’t a permanent fix, said Dr. Tina Tan, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Children “develop much higher levels of immunity from vaccination than from immunoglobulin,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-262dd2" class="body-graf"&gt;The Cedar Rapids IG clinics, led by Arnold, were pulled together at the very last minute. The babies who got the injections had been exposed six days earlier, on Monday, July 7. Families were notified late Friday, July 11, and the treatments started the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0b4c4c" class="body-graf"&gt;“There are infants out there who have no protection, and we don’t want them to get sick,” Arnold said. “Measles can be mild, but it can also be life-threatening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a6b370" class="body-graf"&gt;The majority of measles patients have fared well despite their illness. Still, 13%, or 164 patients, needed to be hospitalized because of the infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-739ffb" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Three people — including two young girls in Texas — have &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/second-measles-death-texas-child-kennedy-rcna199882" target="_blank"&gt;died of measles this year&lt;/a&gt;.

The results are even more surprising. Researchers have discovered that gut bacteria produce a molecule that not only induces but also causes atherosclerosis, the accumulation of fat and cholesterol in the arteries that can lead to heart attacks and strokes. This unexpected link between microbes and &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2023-12-11/three-minutes-of-intense-exercise-a-day-can-improve-cardiovascular-health-in-sedentary-women.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/health/2023-12-11/three-minutes-of-intense-exercise-a-day-can-improve-cardiovascular-health-in-sedentary-women.html"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt; — the leading cause of death in humanity — is a paradigm shift. The work was published Wednesday &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09263-w" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09263-w"&gt;in the journal &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a showcase for the world’s best science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The in-depth study of Santander employees using advanced medical imaging equipment soon revealed another shocking finding: atherosclerosis was ubiquitous. The volunteers were apparently healthy, aged between 40 and 55, but 63% of the participants showed signs of the disease. The new results show that some gut bacteria, in certain states, produce imidazole propionate, a simple molecule with six carbon atoms, eight hydrogen atoms, two nitrogen atoms, and two oxygen atoms (C₆H₈N₂O₂). This compound enters the blood, interacts with immature white blood cells, and triggers an inflammatory reaction in the arteries, which promotes the buildup of fatty plaques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“Imidazole propionate induces atherosclerosis on its own. There’s a causal relationship,” asserts the biologist David Sancho, 53, leader of the new study at the National Center for Cardiovascular Research (CNIC) in Madrid. His team administered the molecule to mice, which developed the disease. Furthermore, scientists observed elevated levels of imidazole propionate in one out of every five volunteers with active atherosclerosis, the type in which fatty plaques are more likely to rupture and form the blood clots that cause heart attacks and strokes. The new results demonstrate that atherosclerosis is not only a disease caused by fat, but that it also has an inflammatory &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2024-07-02/from-the-wheelchair-to-the-bicycle-car-ts-achieve-spectacular-remissions-against-autoimmune-diseases.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/science-tech/2024-07-02/from-the-wheelchair-to-the-bicycle-car-ts-achieve-spectacular-remissions-against-autoimmune-diseases.html"&gt;and autoimmune component&lt;/a&gt;, according to Sancho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="a_m a_m-h "&gt;&lt;span class="_db a_m_w"&gt;&lt;img alt="Aorta arteries from a healthy mouse (left), another exposed to imidazole propionate (center), and another treated with propionate and an inhibitor drug, with red staining of atherosclerotic plaque." decoding="auto" class="_re lazyload a_m-h" srcset="https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/GYU5WVCRXJF7LMV4LM5QYL7W34.png?auth=e0101706e037800f217aad3fae228fd5f7a6b26d68dcf5c71477b376dc498357&amp;amp;width=414 414w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/GYU5WVCRXJF7LMV4LM5QYL7W34.png?auth=e0101706e037800f217aad3fae228fd5f7a6b26d68dcf5c71477b376dc498357&amp;amp;width=828 640w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/GYU5WVCRXJF7LMV4LM5QYL7W34.png?auth=e0101706e037800f217aad3fae228fd5f7a6b26d68dcf5c71477b376dc498357&amp;amp;width=980 1000w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/GYU5WVCRXJF7LMV4LM5QYL7W34.png?auth=e0101706e037800f217aad3fae228fd5f7a6b26d68dcf5c71477b376dc498357&amp;amp;width=1960 1960w" sizes="(min-width:1199px) 1155px,(min-width:1001px) calc(100vw - 44px),(min-width:768px) 767px, 100vw" src="https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/GYU5WVCRXJF7LMV4LM5QYL7W34.png?auth=e0101706e037800f217aad3fae228fd5f7a6b26d68dcf5c71477b376dc498357&amp;amp;width=414" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="a_m_p" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aorta arteries from a healthy mouse (left), another exposed to imidazole propionate (center), and another treated with propionate and an inhibitor drug, with red staining of atherosclerotic plaque.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="a_m_m"&gt;CNIC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The good news is that if C₆H₈N₂O₂ causes the problem in a significant percentage of patients, steps can be taken to prevent it. Researchers have identified the receptor to which the molecule binds and have managed to block it with a drug, reducing the progression of atherosclerosis in mice fed a &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/culture/2022-03-20/is-a-cholesterol-level-over-200-a-death-sentence-antiquated-ideas-about-cholesterol-and-food.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/culture/2022-03-20/is-a-cholesterol-level-over-200-a-death-sentence-antiquated-ideas-about-cholesterol-and-food.html"&gt;high-cholesterol diet&lt;/a&gt;. “With this inhibitor, we completely prevented the development of the disease,” says Sancho, who has patented the experimental treatment with other co-authors, such as the Italian pharmacologist Annalaura Mastrangelo, their colleague Iñaki Robles, and the cardiologist Valentín Fuster, director general of the CNIC in Madrid and president of the Mount Sinai Fuster Heart Hospital in New York, which has borne his name for two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Another of the study’s authors, the Swedish biologist Fredrik Bäckhed, had already discovered in 2018 that imidazole propionate levels were higher in people &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2023-12-03/what-to-eat-to-prevent-and-control-type-2-diabetes.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/health/2023-12-03/what-to-eat-to-prevent-and-control-type-2-diabetes.html"&gt;with type 2 diabetes.&lt;/a&gt; And just three months ago, independent research led by the cardiologist Arash Haghikia advanced the link between the bacterial molecule and atherosclerosis. “The fact that two different groups came to the same conclusion strengthens our confidence that this is a significant and relevant discovery,” argues Haghikia, of Ruhr University Bochum (Germany). “What is particularly striking is that imidazole propionate appears to promote atherosclerosis even when cholesterol levels are normal. This could help explain why some people develop heart disease despite having few or no traditional risk factors, such as high cholesterol or high blood pressure,” he emphasizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="a_m a_m-h "&gt;&lt;span class="_db a_m_w _pr lb_btn"&gt;&lt;img alt="Left to right: the biologist David Sancho and the pharmacologists Annalaura Mastrangelo and Iñaki Robles, at the National Center for Cardiovascular Research in Madrid." decoding="auto" class="_re lazyload a_m-h" srcset="https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/SNWJQHZDERDHTARAG5MFUL5I6Y.jpeg?auth=a86605930325f41d7350f19ea30746d51960ed8934a2ea93236762aabd8d0167&amp;amp;width=414 414w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/SNWJQHZDERDHTARAG5MFUL5I6Y.jpeg?auth=a86605930325f41d7350f19ea30746d51960ed8934a2ea93236762aabd8d0167&amp;amp;width=828 640w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/SNWJQHZDERDHTARAG5MFUL5I6Y.jpeg?auth=a86605930325f41d7350f19ea30746d51960ed8934a2ea93236762aabd8d0167&amp;amp;width=980 1000w,https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/SNWJQHZDERDHTARAG5MFUL5I6Y.jpeg?auth=a86605930325f41d7350f19ea30746d51960ed8934a2ea93236762aabd8d0167&amp;amp;width=1960 1960w" sizes="(min-width:1199px) 1155px,(min-width:1001px) calc(100vw - 44px),(min-width:768px) 767px, 100vw" src="https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/SNWJQHZDERDHTARAG5MFUL5I6Y.jpeg?auth=a86605930325f41d7350f19ea30746d51960ed8934a2ea93236762aabd8d0167&amp;amp;width=414" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden="true" class="icon_multimedia_ampliar | _pa a_m_i a_m_i-a _dn" viewbox="0 0 40 40"&gt;&lt;use xlink:href="#svg-ampliar"&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="a_m_p" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Left to right: the biologist David Sancho and the pharmacologists Annalaura Mastrangelo and Iñaki Robles, at the National Center for Cardiovascular Research in Madrid.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="a_m_m"&gt;CNIC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Cardiovascular diseases kill 18 million people each year. Banco Santander’s chairman, &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2014/09/10/inenglish/1410337590_990302.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2014/09/10/inenglish/1410337590_990302.html"&gt;Emilio Botín, died of a heart attack&lt;/a&gt; four years after signing off on the project, which has allowed for the analysis of more than 4,000 volunteer workers, 400 of whom are included in this new study. The research, conducted using expensive and complex techniques such as computed axial tomography (CAT) and positron emission tomography (PET), has made it possible to detect high levels of imidazole propionate in the very early stages of atherosclerosis, which could greatly facilitate diagnosis at that invisible stage when a person is unknowingly at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Sancho and his colleagues acknowledge that further research will be needed to identify the specific strains of bacteria capable of producing the molecule, but they point to “changes in intestinal microbial ecology” following dietary modifications, with an increase in bacterial genera such as &lt;i&gt;Escherichia&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Shigella&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Eubacterium&lt;/i&gt;. When Fuster presented the project in 2010, he noted how difficult it is to diagnose cardiovascular problems early and how simple it is to prevent them, with measures &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2025-07-08/tell-me-who-you-are-and-ill-tell-you-how-to-exercise-different-personalities-enjoy-different-workouts.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/health/2025-07-08/tell-me-who-you-are-and-ill-tell-you-how-to-exercise-different-personalities-enjoy-different-workouts.html"&gt;such as exercising&lt;/a&gt;, following a healthy diet, and not smoking. The new study shows that blood levels of imidazole propionate are lower in people with diets rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fish, tea, and low-fat dairy products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The Argentine microbiologist Federico Rey and Indian pathologist Vaibhav Vemuganti applaud the “exciting opportunities” that the new study opens for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. In a commentary also published Wednesday in &lt;i&gt;Nature&lt;/i&gt;, the two experts emphasize that exposure to imidazole propionate worsens plaque formation in the arteries of mice. “This effect occurs independently of changes in cholesterol levels, a surprising result given the central role of cholesterol in the development of atherosclerosis,” note the two specialists, from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “This discovery offers an interesting clue about a possible new factor involved in the origin of atherosclerosis. This is very relevant because, although lowering cholesterol — through drugs called statins, for example — can effectively reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, a considerable proportion of people still experience adverse cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarctions or strokes,” they warn. The CNIC itself said in a statement that the new study “could revolutionize” the diagnosis and treatment of atherosclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Sancho stresses that the work has been made possible thanks to the collaboration of thousands of volunteer employees of Banco Santander in Madrid, but also thanks to grants of €1 million from the “la Caixa” Foundation, €150,000 from the European Research Council and €100,000 from the State Research Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The discovery of the decisive effect of imidazole propionate on atherosclerosis takes place against a backdrop in which the scientific community is revealing the unknown role &lt;a href="https://english.elpais.com/health/2025-01-21/tell-me-what-bacteria-live-in-your-gut-and-ill-tell-you-who-your-friends-are.html" target="_self" rel="" title="https://english.elpais.com/health/2025-01-21/tell-me-what-bacteria-live-in-your-gut-and-ill-tell-you-who-your-friends-are.html"&gt;of intestinal microbes&lt;/a&gt; in some human diseases. The biotechnologist Cayetano Pleguezuelos and his colleagues at the Hubrecht Institute (The Netherlands) demonstrated in February 2020 that a strain of the bacterium &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; produces a toxic molecule, called colibactin, which damages the DNA of human cells and causes malignant tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Cases of colorectal cancer are skyrocketing in people under the age of 50, due to unknown causes, doubling in many countries in the last two decades. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09025-8" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09025-8"&gt;Another study&lt;/a&gt;, led by computational biologist Marcos Díaz Gay, suggested just three months ago that behind this colorectal cancer epidemic is the &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; toxin. “In young patients, up to 39 years of age, we see that colibactin pattern in one out of every three cases,” stressed Díaz Gay, of the National Cancer Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sign up for &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://plus.elpais.com/newsletters/lnp/1/333/?lang=en" rel=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;our weekly newsletter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt; to get more English-language news coverage from EL PAÍS USA Edition&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>EL PAÍS English</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 08:50:40 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-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</guid></item><item><title>科学家表示，三人试管婴儿技术使儿童免受遗传性疾病的影响-路透社 | Three-person IVF technique spared children from inherited diseases, scientists say - Reuters</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi4gFBVV95cUxOdU1HLUpsdjR4S2xsNER5amNvWXliNGVDb3BlU3dJSGpHdGhLVnFCcUFsMHRHSk15R1JXN3Q4R05OZEZQdVRqbVplQ1Mycmt6VHo5U2VKVTBkbmdjajFVSE9YVXpEV2NZazR6NVBmWDA3RnF3TllYVVVmYjZGaGVvYlJFNWNHSmhLeVJOM1ljbkNEcFh6ZU15YkhWZG9MZzdJeldOcnhLTU14STFhUFYxa3Y4VkpoV1d6T212WkE0NmdaNzlkeTZVZGcwQVBldXFiSWZwUUlleTM1dk5vX1lVWXhB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Reuters</author><pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 07:31:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4gFBVV95cUxOdU1HLUpsdjR4S2xsNER5amNvWXliNGVDb3BlU3dJSGpHdGhLVnFCcUFsMHRHSk15R1JXN3Q4R05OZEZQdVRqbVplQ1Mycmt6VHo5U2VKVTBkbmdjajFVSE9YVXpEV2NZazR6NVBmWDA3RnF3TllYVVVmYjZGaGVvYlJFNWNHSmhLeVJOM1ljbkNEcFh6ZU15YkhWZG9MZzdJeldOcnhLTU14STFhUFYxa3Y4VkpoV1d6T212WkE0NmdaNzlkeTZVZGcwQVBldXFiSWZwUUlleTM1dk5vX1lVWXhB</guid></item><item><title>为什么抑郁症会增加痴呆症的风险以及如何应对-《每日电讯报》 | Why depression increases your risk of dementia and how to deal with it - The Telegraph</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxOaGJCdjBadkFKUERlamktOTdXN0lLcWJ5M0hHbzZJeEUyQnlXb1lhblo2cWx0RlBHV0hNOFMybUJweXg0RUFxQmxvVWRrU0V0RGxHYWJBUXZYV0tQOU9JcHd6YWNtWHgxOGZNeHZIZVhDR1Z3c3kyVEhpZG9UdDhqZEFVMGRHWGplYWFfWWxUQ3ZXZEpXa2dfa2tnMllKQjFuVkRRQUxMMks2dw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;Why depression or anxiety can sometimes be an early warning sign&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In over 65s with no previous history of mental health problems, the sudden onset of depression and anxiety may actually be an early sign that someone is already developing dementia. Garrard can recall various cases of patients in their 80s, later diagnosed with dementia, who initially presented at his clinic with depressive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/96/6/573"&gt;researchers found that&lt;/a&gt; the likelihood of someone experiencing depression steadily increased in the decade prior to a dementia diagnosis, and Jonathan Schott, a neurology professor at University College London, says that in clinics, neurologists now flag sudden-onset cases of anxiety and depression over the age of 65 as a potential warning sign that dementia is brewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s by no means certain,” he says. “Clearly there are many reasons for becoming depressed or anxious in later life. But in some cases, it could be related to brain changes occurring in the run-up to dementia. There are two broad &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/christmas/2025/01/09/the-13-dementia-risk-factors-and-what-to-do-about-them/"&gt;causes of dementia&lt;/a&gt; – disease of the blood vessels, and then the build-up of abnormal proteins which leads to changes in how brain cells communicate. Basically, the brain is beginning to fail, and one of the manifestations of that is these alterations in mood.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this, John says that there is a need for better tests which can allow doctors to distinguish cases of late-life depression or anxiety which are solely mood disorders, from instances where it’s a more sinister reflection of underlying brain damage. If someone is experiencing early symptoms of dementia, they could be potential targets for future clinical trials of disease-modifying drugs such as the &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/06/19/battle-alzheimers-wonder-drug-nhs/"&gt;Alzheimer’s therapies lecanemab and donanemab&lt;/a&gt;, or other experimental medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How to deal with midlife depression/anxiety&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With mounting evidence linking prolonged midlife mental health problems with later life cognitive decline, experts now feel that addressing these conditions early on might represent a new pathway for reducing dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what can you do if you or a family member are concerned about your mental health and the potential long-term impact on your cognition?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possibility is antidepressant medication, although the evidence for this when it comes to dementia is currently mixed, and depends on the type of &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/wellbeing/mental-health/everything-to-know-about-antidepressants/"&gt;antidepressants&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.pn.2014.7a15"&gt;Some research in lab animals&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that SSRI drugs may reduce the build-up of the toxic amyloid protein in the brain, a key factor in the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. However, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/361/bmj.k1315"&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; funded by the Alzheimer’s Society found that certain anticholinergic drugs – another class of antidepressants which work by blocking the actions of a particular brain chemical called acetylcholine – may worsen dementia risk, although we still need to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s unclear at the moment whether that’s due to the changes in the brain that have already happened before the treatment or the treatment itself,” says Dudley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John is particularly interested in the potential benefits of midlife psychological therapies for reducing the risk of dementia in the long run. She points to &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36106698/"&gt;one study&lt;/a&gt; she carried out using NHS data from across the country which found that improving symptoms of depression and anxiety in midlifers through psychological therapies seemed to be linked with lower rates of future dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It provides really encouraging early evidence to suggest that seeking help for mental health symptoms could potentially be a powerful step in terms of protecting our future cognitive health,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s impossible to know if modern psychotherapies, had they existed 50 years ago, would have helped my grandfather, and prevented him from ultimately developing Alzheimer’s, but there’s a chance that they may well have made a difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Dudley says the message is that if anyone is worried they have had depression for a sustained period of time, it’s never too late to take action. “Some people still think that dementia is an inevitable consequence of ageing,” she says. “But we’re learning more and more that’s not the case, and it’s possible to intervene and reduce your risk.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some foods seem high in carbs but are actually fiber-rich and blood sugar-friendly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Watermelon, edamame and raspberries, among other foods, are lower in carbs than you might expect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating nutrient-dense carbs can support energy, fullness, and overall well-being.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/carbohydrates-8423291" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Carbohydrates often get a bad rap&lt;/a&gt;, but they’re an essential part of a balanced diet and your body’s main source of energy. And while carbs aren’t the enemy, some foods carry a reputation for being high in carbs—even when they’re not. Whether you’re paying closer attention to your carb intake for health reasons or are simply curious about what’s in your food, it can be helpful to know that some foods are lower in carbs than you might expect. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, not all foods with carbs have the same impact on your overall health. For instance, while potatoes and pasta are high in carbs, they also contain other nutrients that benefit your health, setting them apart from less nutritious high-carb foods like ice cream and cookies. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; From sweet fruits to starchy-looking veggies, here are eight foods that may not be as high in carbs as you thought—and easy, delicious ways to enjoy them.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-carrots"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Carrots &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Due to their &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/whats-the-difference-between-natural-and-added-sugars-11694001" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;natural sweetness&lt;/a&gt;, carrots “get unfairly labeled as too sugary, but a cup [raw] only has around 12 grams of carbs,” says &lt;a href="https://nutritionresolution.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alyssa Simpson, RDN, CGN, CLT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s only 4% of the Daily Value for carbohydrates, which is 275 grams per day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Not only that, they’re packed with beta-carotene, a powerful antioxidant that helps fight inflammation and may lower the risk of chronic disease like type 2 diabetes, notes Simpson.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-popcorn"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Popcorn &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Popcorn might surprise, since many popular snack options tend to be pretty high in carbs. Unlike many other snacks, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/287900/is-popcorn-good-for-weight-loss/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;popcorn is low in carbohydrates&lt;/a&gt; and high in fiber. A 3-cup serving has only 15 grams of carbs and up to 4 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “That’s double the fiber than a handful of potato chips for the same carbohydrates,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaitlin-hippley/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Kaitlin Hippley, M.Ed, RDN, LD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. The fiber in popcorn helps slow down digestion and prevent a post-snack spike in blood sugar. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-green-peas"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Green Peas &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While peas are sometimes grouped with higher-carb foods, they deserve a closer look. “A lot of people avoid peas because they think they’re super starchy, but a half cup only has about 12 grams of carbs,” says Simpson.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s much less than other legumes. For instance, black beans have nearly twice that—around 21 grams of carbs in the same serving size.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You’ll also get 4 grams of fiber, plus &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291111/the-10-best-vegan-protein-sources/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based protein&lt;/a&gt; and nutrients like vitamin K and magnesium, both of which support heart and metabolic health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-watermelon"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Watermelon &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fruit contains natural sugars, but that doesn’t mean it’s off-limits or necessarily packed with carbs. For example,  a cup of diced watermelon delivers just 11 grams of carbs and plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-vitamin-c-8546809" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin C&lt;/a&gt; and lycopene—two potent antioxidants that may help protect you against chronic disease, including heart disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Additionally, watermelon is also about 90% water, making it hydrating and refreshing on hot days.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-cottage-cheese"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Cottage Cheese &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Like other foods, dairy products are a natural source of carbohydrates. And they contain lactose, a natural sugar, but that doesn’t mean they are all high in carbs. Cottage cheese is a standout, with only 6 grams of carbs per half-cup and nearly 12 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  “It’s great for blood sugar balance and keeps you full—plus, you can go sweet or savory with it,” says Simpson.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-baby-corn"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Baby Corn &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to foods high in carbs, most people will include corn on their list. “While mature corn [like corn on the cob] contains a modest amount of carbohydrates, baby corn has much less,” says &lt;a href="https://www.diabetesteam.com/writers/683f0deb46c7aa1e0f3349e2" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Avery Zenker, BASc, MAN&lt;/a&gt;. An ear of corn provides 10 grams of carbs, whereas a half-cup of baby corn has just 4 grams of carbs.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-7-edamame"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 7. Edamame &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unlike most beans, such as pinto and black, edamame (young soybeans) are significantly lower in this nutrient. A half-cup contains just 7 grams of carbs, plus 9 grams of protein and 4 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Its fiber-protein combo helps stabilize blood sugar and promote satiety.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-to-add-these-foods-to-a-balanced-diet"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How to Add These Foods to a Balanced Diet &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These nutrient-rich foods are easy to include in everyday meals. Here are a few ideas:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go Meatless More Often:&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t be afraid of the carbs in beans&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;They provide a combination of protein and fiber that can help stabilize blood sugar levels&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Use fiber- and protein-rich edamame and green peas as the star of meatless meals. For instance, toss edamame into grain bowls or salads or add green peas to risottos, pastas or quick veggie soups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snack Smart: &lt;/strong&gt;Many packaged snacks can be high in carbs and added sugars, but options like cottage cheese, raspberries or popcorn can satisfy without causing blood sugar spikes. While you can snack on them on their own, you can also get creative. Top cottage cheese with raspberries and chopped walnuts. Add a pinch of chili powder or cinnamon to flavor your popcorn. Or blend raspberries into smoothies or freeze them into yogurt barks. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upgrade Your Stir-Fries: &lt;/strong&gt;Vegetables like carrots and baby corn add crunch and vibrant color to any stir-fry, without a ton of carbs. Use carrot ribbons in place of noodles or stir-fry rounds with broccoli and tofu. Baby corn pairs well with mushrooms, peppers, and a light soy-ginger sauce. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You don’t need to fear carbs—especially when they come packaged with fiber, protein and beneficial nutrients. Some foods that are often assumed to be high in carbohydrates actually have less than they appear to have. Rather than cutting out entire food groups, focus on choosing nutrient-dense ingredients that help you feel your best. These eight foods are a great place to start: they’re satisfying, versatile and far more blood sugar-friendly than their reputations suggest.
&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROCHESTER, Minn. — We often hear how AI is impacting jobs and industries, and not always in a good way.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's a story about how artificial intelligence is helping the medical world in ways that we likely never imagined. It is changing lives, just ask Joanie and Dave Kraus.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Anything is possible, and she’s definitely got a second chance at life,” says Dave.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dave is talking about their daughter Jorie. The Krauses spent a long time trying to get pregnant and ultimately were able to conceive Jorie through IVF. They thought they had cleared the hurdle. Getting pregnant was the hard part, right? The couple thought health issues were in the clear as genetic testing was done as part of the process.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At our 20-week scan, they found out that she was a little bit small and they found an undefined heart issue. They didn't quite know what it was, and so we prayed for wisdom, and we went to Mayo for a second opinion,” says Joanie.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joanie, we should note, was a long-time KARE 11 employee, managing our sales department until recently.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 33 weeks, the doctors at Mayo decided a cesarean section (C-section) was the best option, and Jorie Kraus was welcomed into the world.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They immediately ended up putting her into one of those incubator things and shipped her off over to St. Mary's campus where I met her over there and Joanie stayed at the Mayo side of the campus and I had both women in my life in two different buildings and trying to split time with both and keep them both ok,” Dave recalls.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jorie went on to spend 73 days in the NICU. It turned out she had not one but five heart issues, among some other physical anomalies, but nothing that couldn't be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How are we going to fix it, and how are we going to address it? And this wonderful surgeon said, 'Hey, don't worry about it. We're going to figure this all out. You just need to worry about who she's taking to prom,'" says Joanie.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joanie and Dave allowed themselves to exhale. But it's not where their baby girl's story ends. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic testing came back showing a problem. Jorie was missing part of her chromosome 10. A spontaneous deletion during pregnancy, meaning it was not inherited from either parent, which is why it wasn't caught during the IVF process. Jorie was diagnosed with DeSanto-Shinawi Syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that was the cause of her physical issues but would also cause low muscle tone, developmental delays and intellectual disabilities. At the time, just a couple dozen people in the world had the same diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Joanie was asking a little bit about what does that mean? And I just sort of piped up and said, 'That means it's permanent. There's nothing with this one. This one doesn't have a fix. This one doesn't have a surgery,' and that's when I had to get up and leave the room," Dave said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With no cure, early interventions, like physical and speech therapies, were the only options. A year passed, and as Jorie fell behind with her milestones like crawling and talking, Joanie and Dave pushed forward, fighting for answers.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We're at the best hospital in the world. Where's the groundbreaking genetic research? And she had this big smile. This big, big smile and she goes, 'Have you met Dr. Whitney Thompson?'”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had, in fact, met Dr. Thompson. She was working in the NICU when they ordered the genetic testing or rapid genome sequencing for Jorie right after birth. And since that time, Thompson had started a new project with Dr. Laura Lambert called BabyForce.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We can send this comprehensive genetic test Day One in the NICU and get a diagnosis within that first week of life, and it can really make a huge difference for patients, but often we get the diagnosis, but we don't have a treatment, and that's really where Babyforce comes in," says Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The doctors take a patient's skin cells and grow them in a lab. Using Artificial intelligence, they search for already FDA-approved drugs that could potentially help. Then they test them on the patient's lab-grown cells to see if it works.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Taking a drug that is already approved, and already known to be safe, and known to have a safety profile in children, really circumvents all of those issues that the rare disease population faces. So, we don't have to have that major investment into running a clinical trial because it's off-label use,” says Lambert.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Jorie, the top hit from AI was an inexpensive drug commonly used to treat seizures in children. In the lab, it worked like a charm, boosting the levels of her working chromosome to compensate for the deleted one. Since the concept is so new, they had to go through ethics and legal departments first. Jorie just started taking the medicine a few months ago. Turns out, it is working like a charm in real life, too.  Within days, Jorie started walking with a walker, going up and down stairs, and even starting to say words.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's like she was getting the information and understanding it but just couldn't figure out what to do with it, and now she's starting to figure out what to do with it,” says Joanie. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A treatment for an ultra-rare disease would normally take years—if at all. The success in Jorie's case opens a door of hope for others in the future.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We're focused on the NICU because, certainly, the earlier we intervene, potentially the more impact we can have on somebody's life, and the hope is we can move that timeline up even more, and start treating before symptoms even develop," says Thompson.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know this could benefit patients who are born with genetic differences, but it also has applications for cancer, for example, where we could sequence an individual's tumor and understand what's causing the cancer and look for drugs using AI to try to have an impact for those patients as well,” adds Lambert.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endless possibilities. Which is also what these doctors have given Jorie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"She's going to be the best Jorie she can be. The barriers have been lifted for her," says Dave. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“She's just such a joy, and you know, we just hope that out of all of the hardship that we went through and all that she has gone through, that it will be a beacon of hope to others,” says Joanie.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, it’s the reason they are sharing their story, to pay it forward. None of this process was covered by insurance. It was all funding from Mayo and private donors. The Krauses have started both a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-the-jorie-effect-hope-for-rare-diseases"&gt;GoFundme&lt;/a&gt; and a charity called &lt;a href="https://www.thejorieeffect.com/"&gt;The Jorie Effect&lt;/a&gt; to help other children with rare diseases have access to this kind of medical care.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thompson and Lambert have already presented their findings at several medical gatherings and will publish their work and findings at the end of July.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;A drug widely used to treat nerve pain and epilepsy has been linked with an increase in cases of dementia and mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team from Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Arizona State University, and the MetroHealth Medical Center in the US crunched the numbers on 26,416 records of patients with chronic &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/one-simple-exercise-is-an-overlooked-solution-to-lower-back-pain"&gt;lower back pain&lt;/a&gt;, looking at the relationship between prescriptions for the anticonvulsant &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabapentin"&gt;gabapentin&lt;/a&gt; and dementia diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having six or more gabapentin prescriptions was linked to a significant increase in dementia risk and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mild_cognitive_impairment"&gt;mild cognitive impairment&lt;/a&gt; (MCI), the data showed: those in that group were 29 percent and 85 percent more likely to be diagnosed with dementia and MCI respectively, within 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/massive-study-links-15-factors-to-early-dementia-risk?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Massive Study Links 15 Factors to Early Dementia Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase was higher among patients aged between 35 and 49, and also rose with the number of prescriptions given, the researchers found. Though the study can't establish a cause for the increase, physicians are encouraged to keep a close eye on patients taking the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gabapentin prescription in adults with chronic low back pain is associated with increased risk of dementia and cognitive impairment, particularly in non-elderly adults," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/rapm-2025-106577"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Physicians should monitor cognitive outcomes in patients prescribed gabapentin."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sold under brand names including Neurontin, gabapentin has proved to be less addictive &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/opioids-watched-in-real-time-as-they-work-deep-inside-the-brain"&gt;than opioids&lt;/a&gt;, making it more likely to be prescribed in recent years. The drug does have some known side effects though, including extreme moods and allergic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't the first time researchers have examined associations between gabapentin and dementia, but previous studies &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2024.05.031"&gt;haven't agreed&lt;/a&gt; on whether or not concerns are warranted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_167804" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-167804" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/GabapentinTablets.jpg" alt="Gabapentin tablets" class="wp-image-167804 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/GabapentinTablets.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/GabapentinTablets-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-167804" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Gabapentin is a commonly prescribed medication for pain relief and epilepsy.

A study published in 1997 found no link between gabapentin and cognitive decline in people with epilepsy, so it's important to continue to widen the data set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These conflicting results could suggest unique mechanisms among patients with the type of backpain that leads to a gabapentin prescription that also increases their risk of dementia, like a certain type of location of inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But gabapentin works by dampening some of the brain's key communication channels, in order to provide relief from pain or make seizures less likely. So the worry is that it could also be damaging links between neurons in ways that might lead to dementia – a concern backed up by this latest study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dementia is a challenging condition to study with &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dementia-risk-can-be-cut-by-45-if-together-we-do-these-14-things"&gt;so many potential factors&lt;/a&gt; to account for, but each study gets us closer to the full picture of how the brain breaks down over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope the current study promotes further research to delineate whether gabapentin plays a causal role in the development of dementia and the underlying mechanisms of this relationship," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/rapm-2025-106577"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/rapm-2025-106577"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Regional Anesthesia &amp;amp; Pain Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
