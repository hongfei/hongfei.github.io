She went to a doctor who told her she had a chest infection and treated her for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But when the treatment failed, she went to a clinic to get an HIV test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"By then I already assumed that I was HIV-positive, and I told the nurse this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She was right, and she has been on ARVs ever since. We're not using her real name at her request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She currently works as a project coordinator for an NGO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We help pregnant sex workers get their ARVs, to ensure their children are born HIV-negative. We also do home visits to make sure that the mothers take their medication on time, and to look after their babies when they go for their monthly check-ups."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Many HIV-positive sex workers in South Africa relied on private clinics funded by the US government's now-defunct aid agency, USAID, to get their prescriptions and treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But most of the facilities closed after US President Donald Trump cut most foreign aid earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In a  report due to be released on Thursday, the UN body in charge of fighting HIV/Aids does not single out the US, but says that drastic cuts from a number of donors have sent shockwaves around the world, and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/pressreleaseandstatementarchive/2025/july/20250710_global-aids-update-media-advisory" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;the "phenomenal progress" in tackling the illness risks being reversed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"New HIV infections have been reduced by 40% since 2010, and 4.4 million children have been protected from acquiring HIV since 2000. More than 26 million lives have been saved," UNAIDS says, warning that if the world does not act, there could be an extra six million new HIV infections and four million Aids-related deaths by 2029.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Gugu believes that many sex workers could be discouraged from going to public hospitals for their HRVs..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The problem with going to public hospitals is the time factor. In order to get serviced at these facilities, you have to arrive at 4 or 5am, and they may spend the whole day waiting for their medication. For sex workers, time is money," Gugu says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She adds that she recently went to her local clinic with some friends to register her details and build a relationship with staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The nurse who attended to us was very rude. She told us there was nothing special about sex workers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;She thinks this could lead to many sex workers defaulting on their medication, "especially because their hospital files contain a lot of personal information, and the concern is that sometimes the nurses at these local clinics aren't always the most sensitive in dealing with this kind of information."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;According to the UN, the US cuts to HIV funding could reverse some of the gains made by what has been called one of the most successful public health interventions in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Scientists in the UK-based &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01186-9/fulltext" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Lancet medical journal&lt;/a&gt; last month estimated that USAID funding directly reduced Aids deaths by 65%, or 25.5 million, over the past two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-d1200759-1 kycbVO"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250701-150711-e3d94715db-web-2.24.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-d1200759-0 dkIvM hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/2175/live/d7846cc0-5cc8-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/2175/live/d7846cc0-5cc8-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2175/live/d7846cc0-5cc8-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/2175/live/d7846cc0-5cc8-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/2175/live/d7846cc0-5cc8-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/2175/live/d7846cc0-5cc8-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/2175/live/d7846cc0-5cc8-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/2175/live/d7846cc0-5cc8-11f0-960d-e9f1088a89fe.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Standing at a podium, George W.

The money was used for various projects, including running mobile clinics to make it easier for patients to get treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The Trump administration's cuts have raised concern that infection rates could spike again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I think we're going to start seeing an increase in the number of HIV infections, the number of TB cases, the number of other infectious diseases," Prof Lynn Morris, Deputy Vice-Chancellor of Johannesburg's Wits University, tells the BBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"And we're going to start seeing a reversal of what was essentially a real success story. We were getting on top of some of these things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Gugu points out that treatment is a matter of life and death, especially for vulnerable populations like sex workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"People don't want to default on their ARVs. They're scared that they're going to die if they don't get access to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The cuts have also affected research aimed at finding an HIV vaccine and a cure for Aids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"There's the long-term impact, which is that we're not going to be getting new vaccines for HIV," Prof Morris adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We're not going to be keeping on top of viruses that are circulating. Even with new viruses that might appear, we're not going to have the surveillance infrastructure that we once had."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;South Africa has been one of the global leaders in HIV research. Many of the medications that help prevent the virus, and which have benefitted people around the world, were trialled in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This includes Prep (pre-exposure prophylaxis), a medication which stops HIV-negative people from catching the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Another breakthrough preventive drug released this year, Lenacapavir, an injection taken twice a year and that offers total protection from HIV, was also tried in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-536eff7b-0 FPsqq"&gt;South African academic Prof Abdullah Ely is concerned that research will be affected by the US funding cut&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In a lab at Wits University's Health Sciences campus, a small group of scientists are still working on a vaccine for HIV. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They are part of the Brilliant Consortium, a group of labs working across eight African countries to develop a vaccine for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We were developing a vaccine test to see how well that works, and then we would trial it on humans," Abdullah Ely, an Associate Professor at Wits University, tells the BBC in his lab. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"The plan was to run the trials in Africa based on research carried out by Africans because we want that research to actually benefit our community as well as all mankind."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But the US funding cuts threw their work into doubt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"When the stop order came, it meant we had to stop everything. Only some of us have been able to get additional funding so we could continue our work. It's set us back months, probably could even be a year," Prof Ely says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The lab lacks funding to carry out clinical trials scheduled for later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"That is a very big loss to South Africa and the continent. It means that any potential research that comes out of Africa will have to be tested in Europe, or the US," Prof Ely says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="embed-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dHQIrb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;In June, universities asked the government for a bailout of 4.6bn South African rand ($260m; £190m) over the next three years to cover some of the funding lost from the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"We are pleading for support because South Africa is leading in HIV research, but it's not leading for itself. This has ramifications on the practice and policies of the entire globe," says Dr Phethiwe Matutu, head of Universities South Africa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;South Africa's Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi announced on Wednesday that some alternative funding for research had been secured. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust have agreed to donate 1m rand each with immediate effect, while the government would make available 400m rand over the next three years, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;This would bring the total to 600m rand, way below the 4.6bn rand requested by researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As for Gugu, she had hoped that by the time she was elderly, a cure for HIV/Aids would have been found, but she is less optimistic now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"I look after a nine-year-old.

Are certain nightmares worse than others? And what – if anything – can you do to stop them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;Blowing a fuse while you sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At a basic physiological level, all mammals, from whales to guinea pigs, experience something akin to dreaming – and are therefore susceptible to nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In humans, explains Dr Justin Havens, a psychological trauma therapist and leading nightmare expert, dreaming serves as overnight therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We dream for a purpose – it's an evolutionary survival mechanism. We're trying to digest the emotional experiences of the day,' he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Nightmares occur when this process doesn't work or is interrupted mid-cycle; like a fuse blowing while you sleep.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Guy Leschziner, professor of neurology and sleep medicine at King's College London, says nightmares evolve from dreams whose subject matter is distressing or traumatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We think that one of the functions of dreaming may be to consolidate memories, but to gradually cause strong emotions linked with these memories to fade,' he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'However, if the emotional content of those dreams or nightmares is very high, you will wake up and this process cannot be completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It means that these emotional memories are never properly dealt with and those strong emotions persist.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And if you think you don't dream, you're wrong. You simply don't remember it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Everyone dreams, for roughly two hours every night, mostly during a deeper stage of sleep called REM ('rapid eye movement') – a period of increased brain activity characterised by quick, darting eye movements beneath closed eyelids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The last hour of sleep is nearly all REM sleep, so any nightmares you're having when your alarm goes off are likely to linger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The term 'nightmare' originates from Old English, with 'mare' being a female demon who was thought to sit on the chest and torment sleepers with terrifying dreams and feelings of suffocation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;Excess cortisol equals faster ageing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists are still unsure which parts of the brain serve as the projection booth for nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But key to what's happening are thought to be the amygdala, found near the brain stem, as well as the prefrontal cortex, located behind the forehead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The amygdala is, functionally speaking, where your 'demons' are kept; it controls emotions such as aggression, fear, anger and sadness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When you're awake, the prefrontal cortex stops these feelings from becoming too dominant. But during sleep, it shuts down – meaning the monsters lurking inside your mind come out to play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mentally, explains Tom Stoneham, a professor of philosophy at the University of York, the impact of a nightmare can leave your body 'in a high state of emotion'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In the immediate aftermath, it is the emotional effects of the nightmare and not the specific content that grips us,' he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Abidemi Otaiku, of Imperial College London, has labelled the significant effects of nightmares 'a public health concern'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nightmares can trigger feelings of anxiety, depression and general unease – which sometimes last hours or even days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2020 study in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology found that participants' moods were notably lower the day after they had a nightmare, compared with days following neutral dreams. There can be profound physical effects, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Nightmares lead to prolonged elevations of cortisol, a stress hormone closely linked to faster cellular ageing,' explains Dr Otaiku, author of the Imperial study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2019 study in the journal Psychophysiology found that bad dreams are accompanied by increased activation of the autonomic nervous system (which regulates functions including heart rate, blood pressure, digestion and sexual arousal).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The after-effects of this – increased body temperature, shallow, rapid breathing and muscle tension – can last long after you wake up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;The gender gap affecting our sleep&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to a 2014 study, women report having more nightmares than men; they're also able to recall them with greater clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Female sleepers dream about different things, according to a 2014 paper published in the journal Sleep, with nightmares revolving around interpersonal conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Men, by contrast, are more likely to dream about disasters, earthquakes or wars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts believe the female tendency towards nightmares is related to changes in body temperature and increased hormonal levels during the menstrual cycle, as well as higher average stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Children are more likely to experience nightmares, too, especially between the ages of three and six.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We think that some of this may be evolutionary,' says Deirdre Barrett, a dream researcher at Harvard Medical School and editor of Trauma and Dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Children are smaller and are vulnerable to many more threats than adults. Nightmares may partially reflect this vulnerability.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But sleep expert Dr Nerina Ramlakhan says childhood nightmares aren't always cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If they are frequent, they can affect energy levels, ability to concentrate and learn, and increase daytime anxiety,' she explains. 'However, they are also normal and can be related to processing emotions, new experiences and creativity.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;Why first-borns have more nightmares&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists think the seeds of future nightmares may be planted early in life, before the age of three-and-a-half – a time from which we usually remember very little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If this period is disrupted by a traumatic event, causing fear or stress, our brains develop coping mechanisms – far earlier than normally required – which can upset the delicate balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This traumatic event doesn't have to be anything out of the ordinary: it can be as simple as the birth of a sibling, causing the elder child to feel forgotten or unloved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2017 paper reported that first-born children had frightening dreams more than twice as frequently as later-born siblings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other causal factors include stress – whether at home or from a busy job – grief, and post-traumatic stress disorder, common in military veterans and victims of violent crimes, among whom the incidence of nightmares rises to between 71 and 96 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Most people will admit to having had a nightmare about falling from a great height; sitting an exam unprepared; being late for something important; being chased; or being unexpectedly naked at work, school or on stage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bryony Sheaves, a research clinical psychologist at the University of Oxford, has connected nightmares to three temperamental traits: paranoia; frequent 'de-personalisation' (a feeling of detachment from yourself or your surroundings); and hallucinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But these don't refer to medical conditions. People vulnerable to nightmares may simply be more suspicious of others, feel stressed in social situations or have vivid, dreamlike imaginations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'In reality, there is not one single cause,' says Dr Sheaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;The scary dreams that prepare us for real-life horrors&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Stemming from our subconscious, nightmares are very personal – but some bad dreams are, statistically speaking, more common and more likely to recur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most searched-for online is the nightmare in which your teeth fall out, said to reflect a life change, recent loss or stressful event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Second most-frequent are dreams about snakes, reportedly triggered by a personal transformation, such as a new job or house move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And third most common are dreams about pregnancy, which are connected to big developments, especially something exciting or unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, of course, there are the dreams we've all had at least once: falling from a great height; sitting an exam unprepared; being late for something important; being chased; or finding yourself unexpectedly naked at work, school or on stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Justin Havens says none of these should be cause for concern – it's the really traumatic, aggressive nightmares that are more likely to do damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Particularly bad ones, he says, involve 'either dying or being tortured, or nightmares of traumatic events that have already happened'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prof Stoneham, however, says nightmares affect us all in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A dream of spiders would have very different effects on an arachnophobe, an entomologist and someone who lived in a culture where spiders were eaten or had some other similarly positive role,' he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Indeed, when 'scary' subjects appear in our nightmares, this can sometimes be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2019 study at the University of Geneva found that bad dreams may help prepare us for frightening real-life situations by activating parts of the brain – the insula and the cingulate cortex – which are responsible for the 'fight or flight' response to danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;Could you be suffering from a nightmare disorder?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If nightmares are occurring regularly, then they might be classified as a nightmare disorder,' explains Dr Ramlakhan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is a pattern of repeated frightening and vivid dreams that cause significant emotional distress and impair functioning.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;We are, however, notoriously bad at doing anything about our bad dreams – particularly in the cold light of day. 'No one goes to their GP saying: "Help, I'm having nightmares",' says Dr Havens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So when should you worry? 'Nightmare disorder ranges in severity based on the frequency of nightmares,' explains Dr Ramlakhan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Mild is less than one nightmare per week. Moderate is one or more nightmares per week, but less than nightly. Severe is nightmares every night.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also vary in duration, with chronic nightmare disorder lasting six months or longer. Ultimately, when – or if – you seek help is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If they're frequent, disrupting your sleep and your psychological health, and having a big impact on your quality of life, then it's probably worth talking to someone,' explains Prof Leschziner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;The red flags nobody should ignore&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts say persistent bad dreams can be warning signs of illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2022, Dr Otaiku found a correlation between frequent nightmares and Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;For sufferers of more severe nightmares, Dr Justin Havens, a psychological trauma therapist, has devised a method called the 'Dream Completion Technique' - which takes just two minutes and can cure bad dreams in a single night&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt; His team looked at data from more than 3,800 men aged 67 or older, with those who reported regular nightmares (at least weekly) more likely to develop Parkinson's and suffer cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Another 2022 paper found that middle-aged adults (average age 50) who reported weekly distressing dreams had a four-fold higher risk of dementia in later life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, Prof Leschziner was involved in a study that linked nightmares to the early stages of autoimmune diseases such as lupus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Such was the correlation that scientists were able to use bad dreams as an indicator that a sleeper's autoimmune disease was about to flare up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We know that inflammation or infection anywhere in the body can give rise to nightmares, as in 'fever dreams',' Prof Leschziner explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This may be a diffuse effect of chemicals called cytokines [associated with inflammation] on the brain, resulting in less stable REM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'An alternative possible explanation is direct inflammation of the brain itself disrupting the brain circuits that regulate sleep and dreaming.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;Why a heatwave means less sleep – but fewer nightmares&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;None of us sleeps well during a heatwave, but scientists say we're actually less likely to have nightmares in the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Usually, when we dream, our core body temperature is higher – above 38C. During nightmares, this elevates even more as the nervous system makes you sweat, increasing your breathing and raising your heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the evidence suggests we spend less time in REM sleep when we're hot (or feverish) already because our brain tries to cool our bodies down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although there's no reliable evidence to suggest the body can predict a nightmare before it begins, some say they can envisage it before they fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Some people might feel a sense of unease, tingling or heightened awareness, but these sensations can also be associated with other sleep phenomena such as hypnagogic [pre-sleep] hallucinations or sleep paralysis,' explains Dr Ramlakhan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are other ways of predicting nightmares – including looking at your family history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Nightmares and vivid dreams can have a hereditary component,' says Dr Ramlakhan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Studies indicate that genetics contribute to the frequency and intensity of nightmares.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Indeed, a 2019 research paper by academics at the University of Helsinki found that, in studies of twins, between 36 and 51 per cent were perfectly in-sync when it came to nightmare frequency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead femail-ccox"&gt;Want to banish bad dreams? Try the 'clock trick'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The good news is that nightmares can be prevented and treated,' explains Dr Otaiku.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Simple measures including avoiding scary movies, maintaining good sleep hygiene, managing stress and seeking treatment for anxiety or depression may be effective.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other experts recommend avoiding alcohol three hours before sleep and caffeine eight hours before sleep, trying yoga or meditation, and ensuring your room is cool, calm and dark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For more severe cases, Dr Havens has devised a method called the 'Dream Completion Technique' (&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="http://stopnightmares.org/"&gt;stopnightmares.org&lt;/a&gt;) – which takes two minutes to do and can cure nightmares in just one night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This self-help technique, his version of the more widely known imagery rehearsal therapy (IRT), involves regaining control over your dreams by imagining a new ending – 'completing' the nightmare – and cementing this in your mind before sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Your imagined solution doesn't need to be moral or peaceful or something that could happen in reality,' he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It can violate the laws of physics, be surreal or feature fictional characters. It can be violent, it can be pure fantasy, or even a little bit silly.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Psychotherapist Dr Stephanie Sarkis uses the 'clock trick', which involves looking for a clock face to snap yourself out of a bad dream. Your brain isn't usually capable of producing a correct one while in a sleep state: the numbers are usually jumbled up or the arms crooked. Seek this out during a bad dream, she recommends, to remind yourself you're still asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;You can teach yourself to do this while awake. If your mind is lucid enough to remember your dreams, there's no reason you can't also do this while asleep. Just by reading this sentence, says Dr Sarkis, you've already planted the idea in your unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But it's not all about managing your mind. 'Bodily comfort matters, too,' says Prof Stoneham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Personally, I find that a single painkiller – half a dose – can help by reducing the sensation of stiffness in my joints at night, resulting in a less-disturbed sleep.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Aspergillus spores are inhaled all the time, usually without causing any problems. But in people who are immunocompromised or who have underlying lung conditions, Aspergillus can be dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0efd9c" class="body-graf"&gt;The fungus is one of the World Health Organization’s top concerns on its &lt;a href="https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/363682/9789240060241-eng.pdf?sequence=1" target="_blank"&gt;list of priority fungi&lt;/a&gt;, which notes that death rates for people with drug-resistant Aspergillus infections range from 47%-88%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e25c63" class="body-graf"&gt;The new study found that the &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fungal-infections-developing-drug-resistance-rcna33937" target="_blank"&gt;fungus’ drug resistance is increasing&lt;/a&gt;. On top of that, patients are typically infected with multiple strains of the fungus, sometimes with different resistance genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-7b7cc0" class="body-graf"&gt;“This presents treatment issues,” said the study’s co-author, Jochem Buil, a microbiologist at Radboud University Medical Centre in the Netherlands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0eb4a7" class="body-graf"&gt;Buil and his team analyzed more than 12,600 samples of Aspergillus fumigatus taken from the lungs of patients in Dutch hospitals over the last 30 years. Of them, about 2,000 harbored mutations associated with resistance to azoles, the class of antifungals used to treat the infections. Most of them had one of two well-known mutations, but 17% had variations of the mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-d0573d" class="body-graf"&gt;Nearly 60 people had invasive infections — meaning the fungi spread from the lungs to other parts of the body — 13 of which were azole-resistant. In those people, nearly 86% were infected with multiple strains of the fungi, making treatment even more complicated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e09bbc" class="body-graf"&gt;“It is an increasingly complicated story and physicians may have trouble identifying whether or not they are dealing with a drug-resistant fungal infection,” said Dr. Arturo Casadevall, chair of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who wasn’t involved with the research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2fcdd8" class="body-graf"&gt;Before treating an Aspergillus fungal infection, doctors look for resistance genes that can give them clues about which drugs will work best. If someone is infected with multiple strains of the same type of fungus, this becomes much less clear-cut. Oftentimes, different strains will respond to different drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-038790" class="body-graf"&gt;“Azoles are the first line of treatment for azole-susceptible strains, but they do not work when a strain is resistant. For those, we need to use different drugs that don’t work as well and have worse side effects,” Buil said, adding that some people will require treatment with multiple antifungal drugs at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-2c58a9" class="body-graf"&gt;The findings illustrate a larger trend of growing pressure on the few drugs available to treat fungal infections — there are only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fungal/hcp/clinical-care/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;three major classes&lt;/a&gt; of antifungal drugs, including azoles, that treat invasive infections, compared with several dozen classes of antibiotics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-270b56" class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/superbug-fungus-spread-two-cities-health-officials-say-n1274763" target="_blank"&gt;Resistance to such drugs is growing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fungal-infections-fda-new-drugs-olorofim-rcna136808" target="_blank"&gt;new ones are uniquely difficult to develop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-6940fd" class="body-graf"&gt;Humans and fungi share about half of their DNA, meaning we’re much more closely related to fungi than we are to bacteria and viruses. Many of the proteins that are essential for fungi to survive are also essential for human cells, leaving fewer safe targets for antifungal drugs to attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-0b23ae" class="body-graf"&gt;“The big problem for all of these fungal species is that we don’t have a lot of antifungals,” said Jarrod Fortwendel, a professor of clinical pharmacy at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, who was not involved with the research. “Typically the genetic mutations that cause resistance don’t cause resistance to one of the drugs, it’s all of them, so you lose the entire class of drugs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e928bd" class="body-graf"&gt;Further complicating matters, the vast majority of azole resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus stems from agriculture, which widely uses fungicides. The fungicides typically have the same molecular targets as antifungal drugs. Farmers spray them on crops, including wheat and barley in the U.S., to prevent or treat fungal disease. (The first instance of azole resistance was documented in the Netherlands, where antifungals are widely used on tulips.) Aspergillus fungi aren’t the target, but exposure to the fungicides gives them a head start developing genes that are resistant to the targets, sometimes before an antifungal drug with the same target even hits the market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-38aef7" class="body-graf"&gt;This was the source of the vast majority of the drug resistance analyzed in the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-cf69eb" class="body-graf"&gt;Fortwendel noted that fungal resistance is increasingly found around the world. “Basically everywhere we look for drug-resistant isotopes, we find them,” he said. “We are seeing this azole drug-resistance happening throughout the U.S. Those rates will likely climb.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-435cc2" class="body-graf"&gt;Any individual person’s risk of having an azole-resistant Aspergillus fumigatus is low, Casadevall said. Infections typically affect people who are immunocompromised and amount to around a few thousand cases per year in the U.S., Casadevall said. While relatively uncommon, the bigger risk is the broader trend of drug-resistant fungal infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-30e1ff" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“The organisms that cause disease are getting more resistant to drugs,” he said. “Even though it’s not like Covid, we don’t wake up to a fungal pandemic, this is a problem that is worse today than it was five, 10 or 20 years ago.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 22:30:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxQMFNuY29VRnM5VUdma1drTWU1bzZSd3ZFUFJfRDVyTGZYMW5CY3h5T0dEN0plMEJfNEY2RGpZZ29mQWFyd1VrNTMzSHZibjRWYmYteTRUcGlDcnJuNkRwTHNlQXdhbzk4MjNRWlpuTklqMmQyclpMTW5YZUZaZEo5UUw2MF9ZbW1HcGh6aDV6Vjd6ZTVKUHlFS0RGRF_SAVZBVV95cUxOTGlaUm9ObXExQXQ2QURnbW9Zek55QkhkSUViLW56eDAwMDF6eE9xeUt1RUE2b0gwUFZ4MG9SN2xwRC13cklyRk1lLThLUXp2c05qdHhYZw</guid></item><item><title>根据一项新的研究- EatingWell ，如果您患有糖尿病，可以多吃令人惊讶的食物 | The Surprising Food to Eat More of If You Have Diabetes, According to a New Study - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaEFVX3lxTE9rN09XYmFzZXBHbjducXhIZS1FM0xieHBKRVk1dkdhYUc3dUp2N3NGMHdZNmZ4OGpXOVNDaHAyVWQzbVQwdjdubm5ybkIza25VUjFqQnFob3Z3ZzU4M1drUi04QzlzamxH?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A study suggests sesame may help improve blood sugar and cholesterol in people with diabetes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sesame products—like oil, seeds or tahini—could support heart health when used consistently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While promising, the evidence is lower-quality, so speak with a healthcare provider before making any major changes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Heart disease is a top health concern for good reason—it’s the leading cause of death worldwide. And if you’re among the 38.4 million American adults who are living with diabetes, your risk is even higher.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s because diabetes doesn’t just affect blood sugar—it also contributes to a cascade of problems that raise the chances of having a heart attack or stroke. These include high levels of LDL (“bad”) cholesterol, elevated triglycerides and chronic oxidative stress, which damages blood vessels over time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Finding simple, effective ways to reduce this risk is a major priority in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/newly-diagnosed-diabetes-8584338" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;diabetes care&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One promising approach researchers have been exploring is food—especially foods with bioactive compounds that go beyond basic nutrition. Sesame (yes, the same seed you’ll find on buns and bagels) has been a key ingredient in many diets for centuries and contains powerful compounds like sesamin and sesamol that act as antioxidants and support heart and metabolic health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Until now, studies on sesame’s health benefits have been relatively small and inconsistent. But a new meta-analysis published in &lt;em&gt;Diabetes &amp;amp; Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research and Reviews&lt;/em&gt; brings together the results of 13 clinical trials to take a closer look. The researchers focused on people with diabetes and evaluated how sesame products affected a wide range of cardiovascular risk factors, including blood sugar, cholesterol levels and markers of oxidative stress. Their findings suggest sesame may do more than add flavor—it could also play a meaningful role in protecting your heart.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, a study method that pools data from multiple past trials to look for patterns. They included 13 randomized controlled trials involving a total of 731 adults with diabetes. Most participants had type 2 diabetes, and the studies were conducted across several countries, including Iran, India, Brazil and Pakistan.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Participants received sesame in various forms—such as sesame oil, whole seeds or capsules—at doses ranging from 200 to 60,000 milligrams per day. The interventions lasted between six and 12 weeks. The researchers measured outcomes like blood sugar, cholesterol, antioxidant activity, body weight and inflammation markers. They used the GRADE system, a formal framework for evaluating the strength of scientific evidence.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did the Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, the study found that sesame products were linked to significant improvements in several cardiovascular disease risk factors for people with diabetes. Specifically, sesame consumption:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These changes suggest that sesame may help regulate blood sugar, improve lipid profiles and protect against oxidative stress—three critical goals in managing diabetes and reducing the risk of heart disease.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, not all findings were positive. The researchers didn’t find significant improvements in HDL (“good”) cholesterol, insulin resistance, inflammation markers like C-reactive protein or blood pressure. In addition, the effects appeared to diminish once sesame supplementation stopped, suggesting ongoing use may be necessary.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s worth noting that the quality of evidence in this study was rated “very low” due to limitations like small sample sizes, short trial durations, inconsistent results and risk of bias in study design. That means while the findings are promising, they should be interpreted with caution. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That said, sesame is a safe and nutritious ingredient to include in your diet, even if these specific heart-health benefits aren’t fully confirmed. It’s &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/surprising-nutrient-for-better-heart-health-8686588" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;rich in healthy fats&lt;/a&gt;, fiber and antioxidants, and previous studies have linked it to lower inflammation, improved blood pressure and better cholesterol levels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-does-this-apply-to-real-life"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Does This Apply to Real Life? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re living with diabetes or concerned about heart health, adding sesame products to your diet could be a simple, budget-friendly step with potential upside. In the reviewed studies, most benefits were seen with higher doses (around 30 grams per day) and longer use (eight weeks or more), so consistency matters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Try adding sesame oil to stir-fries or salad dressings, sprinkling toasted seeds over vegetables and grains or using tahini in sauces, dips and smoothies. Crushed or blended sesame (like tahini or sesame oil) may offer more benefits than whole seeds, since grinding improves the bioavailability of beneficial compounds like sesamin.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, sesame isn’t a magic bullet. It should be part of a broader strategy that includes medical treatment, physical activity and a balanced diet. And if you’re on medications for blood sugar or cholesterol, check with your healthcare provider before starting any supplement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sesame may offer heart-protective benefits for people with diabetes, according to a new meta-analysis. It helped improve blood sugar, cholesterol and antioxidant activity—three pillars of cardiovascular health. While the overall quality of the evidence is low, these findings add to a growing body of research suggesting that sesame could be a helpful addition to diabetes care. Incorporating sesame oil, tahini or seeds into your meals may be a flavorful and health-supportive choice worth exploring.&lt;br&gt;

But not all wheat is the same – and the way in which it’s grown, processed, and baked affects the nutrients that are present in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, the wheat industry has mostly focused on boosting yields, reducing inputs like fertilizers and pesticides, and ensuring good baking quality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What often gets overlooked, however, is that wheat can also be a valuable source of nutrients. In fact, it contributes over 20% to the global supply of fiber, minerals, and trace elements, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (&lt;a href="https://www.fao.org/home/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;FAO&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But getting more nutrition out of wheat isn’t just about planting a different variety. It involves the entire chain – all the way from the field to the oven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-bread-nutrition-the-basics"&gt;Understanding bread nutrition – the basics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bread can be surprisingly diverse when it comes to nutrition. A slice of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5310957/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;whole grain bread&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, can pack a good amount of fiber, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/vitamin-b-paradox-supplement-linked-to-heart-disease-risk/"&gt;B vitamins&lt;/a&gt;, iron, magnesium, and complex carbs. These nutrients help regulate blood sugar, support digestion, and provide long-lasting energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, white bread – made from refined flour – loses much of that fiber and many &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/micronutrient-deficiency-rates-are-soaring-worldwide/"&gt;micronutrients&lt;/a&gt; during processing. Manufacturers often enrich it to add some of those nutrients back, but it still doesn’t match the nutritional punch of whole grain varieties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kind of bread you eat matters, but so does how much. Bread is a carb-heavy food, and while carbs aren’t the enemy, overdoing them – especially if the bread is low in fiber – can spike your blood sugar and leave you hungrier sooner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re aiming for a more nutritious option, look for loaves with at least 3 grams of fiber and minimal added sugar. Bonus points for sprouted grains, seeds, or sourdough, which can improve digestion and nutrient absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-characteristics-of-wheat-varieties"&gt;Characteristics of wheat varieties &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the &lt;a href="https://www.uni-hohenheim.de/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Hohenheim&lt;/a&gt; and the University Medical Center at the &lt;a href="https://www.uni-mainz.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Mainz&lt;/a&gt; teamed up with four wheat breeding companies to study how wheat’s nutritional value can be improved across the whole value chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over five years, they recorded more than 6,000 traits across 282 wheat varieties and 400 breeding lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Friedrich Longin is director of the Wheat Department at the &lt;a href="https://lsa.uni-hohenheim.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;State Plant Breeding Institute&lt;/a&gt; and coordinator of the &lt;a href="https://lsa.uni-hohenheim.de/en/betterwheat_en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Betterwheat project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The unique thing about the project was the holistic view of variety characteristics along the entire value chain,” explained Dr. Longin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition to important characteristics for successful cultivation, several dozen processing characteristics for bakeries were considered, as well as important ingredients and proteins that could be important for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/proper-nutrition-in-the-first-1000-days-of-life-is-crucial/"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; nutrition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-some-wheat-just-has-more-nutrients"&gt;Some wheat just has more nutrients&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wheat varieties were tested in different environments across Europe to measure how both breeding and growing conditions influence the traits of the wheat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This allows us to estimate the extent of the influence of breeding, but also that of the growing environment, on these many traits,” noted Dr. Johannes Schacht, senior wheat breeder at &lt;a href="https://www.limagrain.com/en"&gt;Limagrain&lt;/a&gt; GmbH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the team’s main goals was to understand how nutrient levels vary between wheat types. They tested about 800 wheat samples for 13 key minerals and trace elements like iron and &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/calcium-zinc-are-keys-to-healthier-pregnancy/"&gt;zinc&lt;/a&gt; – nutrients that are important for immunity, metabolism, and cell health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were able to determine that the nutrient content in different wheat varieties varies greatly – and can fluctuate by up to 50%,” stated Dr. Longin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our trials also show that the nutrients in wheat can be combined well with the required baking qualities in terms of breeding. These correlated positively with the protein content and dough properties.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-measuring-wheat-nutrient-content"&gt;Measuring wheat nutrient content&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To apply this research practically, the scientists explored how to quickly measure nutrient content in wheat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One method, x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry, could be a game changer. It scans wheat with X-rays and, based on prior calibrations, provides fast, reliable nutrient readings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In order to use this knowledge in practice, xrf fluorescence spectrometry is a method that can be used to measure the nutrient content in wheat quickly and reliably,” explained Dr. Longin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But using this technology widely would require investment. “This is only possible if the additional work is also paid for,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there’s another catch: boosting wheat’s nutrition only makes a difference if people eat more &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/refined-grains-increase-the-risk-of-heart-disease/"&gt;whole grains&lt;/a&gt; or at least &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/chocolate-with-less-sugar-still-tastes-great-with-a-secret-ingredient/"&gt;flours&lt;/a&gt; with high type numbers (1050 and up). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s because most nutrients are in the outer layers of the grain, which are lost in refined flours like types 405, 550, and 812.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-bakers-make-wheat-digestible"&gt;Bakers make wheat digestible&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if wheat is nutrient-rich, our bodies might not absorb those nutrients unless the bread is &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/freezing-bread-could-make-it-healthier/"&gt;baked&lt;/a&gt; the right way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The healthy ingredients in wheat are bound in phytic acid. However, this acid cannot be digested and is excreted along with the beneficial nutrients,” said Dr. Longin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the researchers partnered with artisan bakers to test four common baking methods. One technique stood out: combining a long dough cycle with sourdough. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that the phytic acid is almost completely broken down during this baking process, making the ingredients available to the body,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-better-bread-starts-with-better-choices"&gt;Better bread starts with better choices&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;From field to bakery, everyone involved in wheat production can help improve the nutritional value of bread. But it starts with us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All partners in the wheat value chain can influence the nutritional content of bread,” said Dr. Longin. “However, clear priorities must be set: first of all, we consumers should eat more whole grains.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This should then be baked with a long leavening process, and only then does breeding and targeted grain trading make sense in order to further optimize the nutrient profile.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wheat offers more than just &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-almonds-can-help-you-cut-calories/"&gt;calories&lt;/a&gt;. With the right science, baking methods, and consumer choices, it can play a much bigger role in a healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 21:56:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQZUVMeGhwaDJVa1dGdkpXckNGZEgwYzZ6bWVPbVlzVjlDVFdkNnluZWlwbXExMmU1WjVmLTJvMkdvTTVLMGdkdWoteHp2RlpjYmozaGpDSmdNQUFLN1oyUks1Q1ppSlhCM3RyMWYxOEZtYUNOQ3VzV0dkTUVSd2U4aWVxYnpITEZ0Ump3UE9PakI</guid></item><item><title>裸盖菇素有望成为抗衰老疗法-神经科学新闻 | Psilocybin Shows Promise as Anti-Aging Therapy - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE1UWExBSHlWN2cwcWszZGtrNXA1ZG4xOEpHTHoxY3VJeFVBa096ZVpyVmlqWHFuSjBDVTdwWXJaSlVoalhQcUxWN0xMTVhnMFpoTExpVUJSenI0aTBPeVY1c1ZBbjJ4RWhJQXk4YjVoQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Psilocybin, the active compound derived from psychedelic mushrooms, significantly delayed cellular aging and extended lifespan in a preclinical study. Researchers observed a 50% increase in the lifespan of human skin and lung cells and a 30% increase in survival in aged mice treated with psilocybin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The compound appeared to reduce oxidative stress, preserve telomeres, and improve DNA repair, all key to slowing aging. These findings suggest psilocybin may one day enhance not just lifespan but also quality of life in aging populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cellular Longevity:&lt;/strong&gt; Psilocybin extended the lifespan of human cells by over 50%.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved Aging in Mice:&lt;/strong&gt; Treated aged mice lived 30% longer with healthier physical traits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mechanisms Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; Benefits linked to reduced stress, DNA repair, and telomere preservation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Emory University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As revenues from the anti-aging market– riddled with hope and thousands of supplements–– surged past $500 million last year, Emory University researchers identified a compound that actively delays aging in cells and organisms. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A newly published study in &lt;em&gt;Nature Partner Journals’ Aging&lt;/em&gt; demonstrates that psilocin, a byproduct of consuming psilocybin, the active ingredient in psychedelic mushrooms, extended the cellular lifespan of human skin and lung cells by more than 50%. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel, researchers also conducted the first long-term &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; study evaluating the systemic effects of psilocybin in aged mice of 19 months, or the equivalent of 60–65 human years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results indicated that the mice that received an initial low dose of psilocybin of 5 mg, followed by a monthly high dose of 15 mg for 10 months, had a 30% increase in survival compared to mice that did not receive any. These mice also displayed healthier physical features, such as improved fur quality, fewer white hairs and hair regrowth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While traditionally researched for its mental health benefits, this study suggests that psilocybin impacts multiple hallmarks of aging by reducing oxidative stress, improving DNA repair responses, and preserving telomere length.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telomeres are the structured ends of a chromosome, protecting it from damage that could lead to the formation of age-related diseases, such as cancer, neurodegeneration, or cardiovascular disease. These foundational processes influence human aging and the onset of these chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study concludes that psilocybin may have the potential to revolutionize anti-aging therapies and could be an impactful intervention in an aging population. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most cells in the body express serotonin receptors, and this study opens a new frontier for how psilocybin could influence systemic aging processes, particularly when administered later in life,” says Louise Hecker, PhD, senior author on the study, and former associate professor at Emory University, where the research was initiated and funded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While much of what researchers know about psilocybin relates to the brain, few studies have examined its systemic impacts. Many people associate psilocybin with the hallucinogenic impacts, but the majority of the cells in the body express serotonin receptors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study opens new questions about what long-term treatments can do. Additionally, even when the intervention is initiated late in life in mice, it still leads to improved survival,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;which is clinically relevant in healthy aging,” adds Hecker, currently an associate professor at Baylor College of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This news comes on the heels of KFF’s recent report that U.S. life expectancy is still below that of other countries similar in income and size, with an average lifespan of 78.4 years, compared to 82.5 years elsewhere. Not only was it the lowest, but as the lifespan in similar countries increased by 7.9 years from 1980-2022, whereas the U.S. life expectancy has only increased by 4.7 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study provides strong preclinical evidence that psilocybin may contribute to healthier aging– not just a longer lifespan, but a better quality of life in later years,” says Director of Psychedelic Research at Emory University’s Department of Psychiatry Ali John Zarrabi, MD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a palliative care physician-scientist, one of my biggest concerns is prolonging life at the cost of dignity and function. But these mice weren’t just surviving longer—they experienced better aging,” adds Zarrabi, co-investigator of the study.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zarrabi emphasized the importance of further research in older adults, as well as the well-documented overlap between physical and mental health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Emory is actively involved in Phase II and III clinical trials of psilocybin-assisted therapy for depression, and these results suggest we also need to understand psilocybin’s systemic effects in aging populations,” says Zarrabi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“My hope is also that if psilocybin-assisted therapy is approved as an intervention for depression by the FDA in 2027, then having a better quality of life would also translate into a longer, healthier life.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was initiated at Emory University and funded by several awards, including the Imagine, Innovative, and Impact (I3) Award, Emory University School of Medicine; the Georgia CTSA NIH Award; and a grant from Emory’s Woodruff Health Sciences Center for Health in Aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychopharmacology and longevity research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#107c7162713e673e7d7f7f627550757d7f62693e757465" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lara Moore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://emory.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Emory University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Lara Moore – Emory University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41514-025-00244-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Psilocybin treatment extends cellular lifespan and improves survival of aged mice”&lt;/a&gt; by Louise Hecker et al. &lt;em&gt;npj Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psilocybin treatment extends cellular lifespan and improves survival of aged mice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psilocybin, the naturally occurring psychedelic compound produced by hallucinogenic mushrooms, has received attention due to considerable clinical evidence for its therapeutic potential to treat various psychiatric and neurodegenerative indications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain enigmatic, and few studies have explored its systemic impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We provide the first experimental evidence that psilocin (the active metabolite of psilocybin) treatment extends cellular lifespan and psilocybin treatment promotes increased longevity in aged mice, suggesting that psilocybin may be a potent geroprotective agent.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 21:52:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE1UWExBSHlWN2cwcWszZGtrNXA1ZG4xOEpHTHoxY3VJeFVBa096ZVpyVmlqWHFuSjBDVTdwWXJaSlVoalhQcUxWN0xMTVhnMFpoTExpVUJSenI0aTBPeVY1c1ZBbjJ4RWhJQXk4YjVoQQ</guid></item><item><title>随着疫苗接种率的下降，可能会复发的疾病—以及您应该关注的原因- CNN | The diseases that could return as vaccination rates decline — and why you should care - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihgFBVV95cUxNTFQ4VlozLS14X09nWXNWbXlWeWoxN2J2dTltSlpxU3dzM3otQ3VnOXFqajhNdTdzRDR6Rl82RkE3aDdlRmRSd3pUempCMXRvZ05zc2k4Y05MU3pOX2hfeE80NERWLTBCR09hbVo2QnI2OGFXVnY5WmNWM0w0ME9HMzdwUnc3UdIBiwFBVV95cUxNdENpUjZJNG5aOXdCMVdTVVJBeG1iWVV4N0ozSGNiR1duemtlVXZKcmNBSEVaenFQZFJfWS1LdUtXMzFZcHdJTjBnZ0prMC05Q2JpQnZjQ0FCbGxRRjBUcGRNZFlrSUZnUDRxUUoxZHZZZFE0cjBIV1gwbFE5Wk5mUEZ2RkN5OE4xTFZJ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Measles have surged to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/09/health/measles-cdc-vaccine-skepticism-monarez"&gt;a record high&lt;/a&gt;, with more cases reported this year than any year since the disease was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw13m1s00003b6mzx50yd0v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This disappointing record comes amid falling childhood vaccination rates: Coverage against measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, polio and pertussis is declining in more than 30 states, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw1nure000k3b6mhn4dpkfg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some people may believe that if they’re personally vaccinated, they have nothing to worry about. But is individual protection enough when contagious illnesses start multiplying? How will falling vaccination rates result in the return of previously eliminated diseases? Will only children be affected, or could adults see an impact as well? Who would be at highest risk if there is lower population-wide immunity? And what can be done to prevent this possibility?
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw1okzd000n3b6m01wdw838@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To get some answers, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen is an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw1pqn9000q3b6mxc0cc51m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Can falling vaccination rates result in the return of diseases that have been eliminated?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw1rhsp000v3b6myxqjo175@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Leana Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes. There are numerous examples around the world. Countries that were once polio-free have had polio outbreaks due to interruptions in childhood immunization programs caused by war and conflict. Measles outbreaks have occurred in countries where measles had been eliminated, due to falling vaccine coverage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw1rhsp000w3b6myv57h06f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This, in fact, is what we are seeing now in the US. In Texas, 753 measles cases have been confirmed since January.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;According to the Texas Department of State Health Services, 98 of these patients have been hospitalized, and two people, both children, have died. This outbreak is believed to have originated in communities with low vaccination rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw1qxjh000t3b6mshj32e75@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What could happen if childhood vaccination rates declined further? &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2833361" target="_blank"&gt;A recent study published in JAMA&lt;/a&gt; predicted that a 10% decline in measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine coverage could result in more than 11 million measles infections over 25 years. A 50% decline in routine childhood vaccinations could result in 51 million measles cases, 9.9 million rubella cases and 4.3 million polio cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcwh87ps00023b6n6b2ziu5b@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The projections also included the number of people affected by severe consequences of these diseases: As many as 10.3 million people in the US could be hospitalized, 159,200 could die, 5,400 could experience paralysis from polio, and 51,200 could have neurological consequences from measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw1vjtb000z3b6m036gfk7s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Is that only unvaccinated people? If someone is vaccinated, do they need to worry if others are unvaccinated?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw1z7r100143b6mwyt9jujn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen: &lt;/strong&gt;They should still worry for three main reasons.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw1z7r100153b6m0np6zzme@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            First, while many vaccinations provide excellent protection against disease, there is still a chance of breakthrough infections — meaning that the vaccine doesn’t provide 100% protection. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/questions.html" target="_blank"&gt;Two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% protective&lt;/a&gt; against measles infection, which is an outstanding level of protection. But it’s not 100%, so if someone is exposed to measles, there is still a chance they could become infected. However, vaccination substantially reduces the likelihood of infection and also of &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmeasles%2Fabout%2Fquestions.html&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CLee.Smith1%40wbdcontractor.com%7Cd7be32ef99dc41594ac808ddbef033a2%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638876661064504563%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=pjWyYM%2Bt5XRHeYWkmlO9CQIy8ZQ8Z7fIa0darEmyCi8%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;having severe disease&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if they were to become infected. The more disease there is in the community, the higher the likelihood of exposure and infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw1z4lq00123b6m75scgjmu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Second, there may be some waning of vaccine effectiveness over time. For instance, according to the CDC, immunity to pertussis — also known as whooping cough — starts to wane after a few years following vaccination. Older adults who received childhood vaccinations many years ago may become susceptible if previously controlled childhood diseases make a comeback.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw236qi00183b6mfc53530u@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Third, there are people who are unable to receive the benefit of vaccination directly themselves. Some people are unable to receive certain vaccines because of specific medical conditions. For instance, someone who has a weakened immune system may not be able to get the MMR vaccine because it contains a live, weakened form of the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw2675o001b3b6mlaqi0onh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Also, some people may have medical conditions that render vaccines less effective at protecting them. These individuals depend on the rest of society — those who can receive the vaccine — to do so and try to prevent these diseases from spreading.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw27ghu001e3b6m2p4aefcn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What about pregnant people? Are there also some vaccines they cannot get?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw29mn3001j3b6ma1nbw25s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; This is another good point. Take rubella, or German measles. Pregnant individuals cannot receive the MMR vaccine because it contains live virus. But rubella can be especially dangerous during pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw29mn3001k3b6m1sfo7e02@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition to increasing the risk of miscarriage and stillbirth, rubella can lead to a condition called congenital rubella syndrome that can cause numerous birth defects including heart problems, brain damage, deafness, and lung, liver, eye and thyroid ailments. According to the World Health Organization, before the introduction of the vaccine, as many as 4 babies in every 1,000 live births were born with this condition. Rubella remains the leading cause of vaccine-preventable birth defects.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw29mn3001l3b6mnoz9qdl9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pregnant patients should not receive other live-attenuated vaccines either. Varicella, the vaccine against chickenpox, is another one of these vaccines. People should receive the vaccines before they are pregnant, ideally as part of their routine childhood immunizations. And other people can help to reduce disease in the community by getting vaccinated themselves.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw29mn3001m3b6mew0v0tsy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Who would be at highest risk if there is lower population-wide immunity?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw29mn3001n3b6m3y3y8gmf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; There are three groups I would be the most worried about. First are newborns who are too young to be vaccinated. They are also among the most medically fragile; something that is a mild cold for an older child or healthy adult could send them to the hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw29mn3001o3b6mcogntunf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Second are immunocompromised people. This is a large group and includes patients receiving cancer treatments, transplant patients and individuals taking immunosuppressant medications. These individuals are more likely to become severely ill if exposed to disease. Vaccines may also not protect them as well, or they may be ineligible to receive certain vaccines as we discussed earlier.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw29mn3001p3b6mj1kki2oi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Third are the elderly. As we discussed many times in reference to Covid-19, these are individuals whose age and underlying medical conditions make them more susceptible to severe illness. That, in combination with possible waning immunity from certain vaccines, could put them at higher risk if there is more disease in the community because of lower vaccine coverage.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw29mn3001q3b6moelmxo0i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What can be done to prevent this possibility?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw29mn3001r3b6mkdp2rbmu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wen:&lt;/strong&gt; Everyone should speak with their primary care provider to verify that they are up to date on recommended vaccines. Parents with young children should do this with their family’s pediatrician, and adults should also be sure to speak with their family physician or internist as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw29mn3001s3b6m0aj5889p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The reason to do this is primarily to ensure that you are well-protected. If you are eligible for additional booster doses, you may consider getting them, or, if you are more susceptible to certain illnesses because you are not eligible for some vaccines, you should also know this and take precautions accordingly.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcw29mn3001t3b6m1viy7qia@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There’s another reason: The entire concept of population immunity depends on all of us doing our part to keep diseases at bay. That protects us — and others around us, including those who are especially vulnerable to severe illness and death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

In people with creatine deficiency disorders, supplements often fail to improve neurodevelopment because the brain’s protective barrier blocks access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are developing a novel technique to deliver creatine directly to the brain, bypassing this barrier to restore normal brain function. Early work shows promise in improving brain health in conditions that currently leave many with lifelong cognitive challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Role of Creatine:&lt;/strong&gt; Creatine is essential for energy production in brain cells and supports functions like memory, learning, and seizure control.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deficiency Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; People with creatine deficiencies often improve muscle mass with supplements but continue to struggle with severe neurodevelopmental impairments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovative Delivery:&lt;/strong&gt; A targeted method is being tested to deliver creatine directly to the brain, overcoming the natural barriers that prevent supplementation from working effectively.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creatine is popularly known as a muscle-building supplement, but its influence on human muscle function can be a matter of life or death.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Creatine is very crucial for energy-consuming cells in skeletal muscle throughout the body, but also in the brain and in the heart,” said Chin-Yi Chen, a research scientist at Virginia Tech’s Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-111507"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/07/creatine-brain-functio0n-neurosicne-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;It may play a role in a variety of functions, including seizure control, learning, memory, and brain development. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chen is part of a research team working to develop a technique that uses focused ultrasound to deliver creatine directly to the brain. The work, being conducted in the lab of Fralin Biomedical Research Institute Assistant Professor Cheng-Chia “Fred” Wu, will be supported by a $30,000 grant from the Association for Creatine Deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creatine plays a vital role in the brain, where it interacts with phosphoric acid to help create adenosine triphosphate, a molecule essential for energy production in living cells. In addition to its role in energy production, creatine also influences neurotransmitter systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, creatine influences the brain’s major inhibitory pathways that use the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid, which limits neuronal excitability in the central nervous system. It may play a role in a variety of functions, including seizure control, learning, memory, and brain development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A growing body of research suggests that creatine may itself function as neurotransmitter, as it is delivered to neurons from glial cells in the brain and can influence signaling processes between other neurons. While creatine deficiency disorders can weaken the skeletal muscle and the heart, they can also severely affect the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many patients see increased muscle mass and body weight with creatine supplements, but they often continue to face neurodevelopmental challenges that can hinder their ability to speak, read, or write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is largely caused by the brain’s protective blood-brain barrier. This selective shield blocks harmful substances like toxins and pathogens from entering brain tissue, but it can also prevent beneficial compounds like creatine from reaching the brain when levels are low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wu studies therapeutic focused ultrasound, which precisely directs sound waves to areas of the brain to which access has been opened temporarily. The process allows drugs to reach diseased tissue without harming surrounding healthy cells. While Wu is investigating this method as a potential treatment for pediatric brain cancer, he also sees potential in applying it to creatine deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Through the partnership between Virginia Tech and Children’s National Hospital, I was able to present our work in focused ultrasound at the Children’s National Research &amp;amp; Innovation Campus,” Wu said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There, I met Dr. Seth Berger, a medical geneticist, who introduced me to creatine transporter deficiency. Together, we saw the promise that focused ultrasound had to offer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Focused Ultrasound Foundation has recognized Virginia Tech and Children’s National as Centers of Excellence. Wu said the two organizations bring together clinical specialists, trial experts, and research scientists who can design experiments that could inform future clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was a moment that made me really excited — that I had found a lab where I could move from basic research to something that could help patients,” Chen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When Fred asked me, ‘Are you interested in this project?’ I said, ‘Yes, of course.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because creatine deficiencies can impair brain development, the early stages of Chen’s project will concentrate on using focused ultrasound to deliver creatine across the blood-brain barrier. Chen hopes the technique will restore normal brain mass in models of creatine deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c7aba6aca2ababa2be87b1b3e9a2a3b2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Leigh Anne Kelley&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://vt.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Virginia Tech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Leigh Anne Kelley – Virginia Tech&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 21:09:43 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMia0FVX3lxTE9mVkxtMS1fYmZ6MWNyWUstajN6U1FBU1dnX0FCLVN4dURFMDk0ekVKNGh4YnQ2a19nYU9WajBXeHpNTGdoa3Z2M2tKVFhvXzY2UmM5ZHNCS1E0ZHI4bktseGV4VWhraVY4RzNV</guid></item><item><title>意识形态极端主义的4个心理标志-大思考 | The 4 psychological markers of ideological extremism - Big Think</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilAFBVV95cUxNNXJFOGRGblYxTkxIa29hVVdpTFJSYkFMVVpjLUg4dEQ2MHNxOUlsakl0Zm9IdTM0aGNLRzNiTDZVUEQwejVzbkhpZEtXa191TGs2N2ZWNm5Yd0JzTUxKdGhkNjJkTl85RGJaTmhFU1YyMjBTMVV2TENZN1RzUTdpYjJjMXZGeGhLMW90Qy1pQk80UDc3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div x-data="prose" class="mb-8 prose  with-dropcap"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychology is largely the study of correlations and the extent to which we can establish connections between correlations and causation. We are often told that “correlation does not mean causation” in the world of data. A classic example: Ice cream sales have a positive correlation with crime rates. Ice cream does not cause criminality, but apparently, the summer months cause both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this is no hard rule. Although correlation doesn’t &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; mean causation, it can often seriously imply or suggest it. Psychologists grapple with this all the time. For example, it’s been anecdotally obvious for millennia that people who sleep fewer hours tend to perform worse on memory, attention, and decision-making tasks, and young people with irregular bedtimes often achieve poorer grades. That’s “just” a correlation. It’s only relatively recently that we have the neuroimaging and neuroscientific apparatus to prove causality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The specter of correlation/causation hovered over this week’s &lt;a href="https://miniphilosophy.substack.com/"&gt;Mini Philosophy interview&lt;/a&gt; with the prizewinning author &lt;a href="https://www.leorzmigrod.com/"&gt;Leor Zmigrod &lt;/a&gt;about her recent book, &lt;em&gt;The Ideological Brain&lt;/em&gt;. Zmigrod’s book explores extreme ideologies, and her career has been spent finding these correlations. During our interview, Zmigrod shared the findings of both her book and career to argue that there are four principal factors that correlate with someone holding extreme ideological beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, these are the factors that most often lead a person to become an extremist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cognitive-rigidity"&gt;Cognitive rigidity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Cognitive rigidity is the tendency to see the world in a really binary way,” Zmigrod says. “It’s where you really struggle to adapt to change, and you tend to think along one mental track rather than switching between different modes of thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many ways you can test for this kind of rigidity, but Zmigrod’s favored method is to ask someone to imagine the possible uses for an item. Let’s say I showed you a Coca-Cola bottle: What could you use it for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more rigid reader will find it hard to think outside the paradigm of “it can hold liquid.” Others will see it as a candle holder, a tiny terrarium, a vase, a salt shaker, and so on. This rigidity in thought is often correlated with extreme ideologies. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6514156/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;The more rigid a person’s thoughts, the more they incline toward extremism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-emotional-volatility"&gt;Emotional volatility&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second factor is “emotional impulsivity” or volatility. These people will “tend to be the most seeking of thrills and sensations in their daily lives,” Zmigrod says. “They want that novelty and that sensation. This is the person who’s going to run to the front of the line.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t overly surprising. It makes sense that people who are extreme in their day-to-day lives might tend toward &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30382738/"&gt;extreme ideologies&lt;/a&gt;. But it also involves another set of co-appearing characteristics — what Zmigrod calls the tendency some people have “to gravitate towards violent solutions and self-sacrifice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think about your friends, who is the most likely to pick a fight? Who’s the most likely to do something impulsive and jump without looking? Well, you might want to check how ideologically extreme they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-amygdala"&gt;Amygdala&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next two markers of extremism are invisible to us. Unless, that is, you happen to be reading this article on a wheely stool next to an MRI machine. In our interview, Zmigrod revealed how there are two neurobiological aspects of a person’s brain that correlate with an increased likelihood of extremism. The first centers on the amygdala.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The amygdala is responsible for the processing of negative emotions like fear, threat, and disgust,” Zmigrod says. “And that brain area is actually larger in right-wing believers than left-wing believers. And this is a finding that’s been consistent across multiple countries, hundreds of participants, that there’s this brain area that might predispose you either to a left-wing or a right-wing ideology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21474316/"&gt;We have correlates and data sets&lt;/a&gt;, evidence and observations. It’s left to us, the readers, to draw the conclusions we think are there to draw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prefrontal-cortex"&gt;Prefrontal cortex&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other neurobiological aspect of extreme ideology is related to our “more sophisticated decision-making and rationality,” which is found in the prefrontal cortex. According to a 2025 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306452225003045"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by Adrián-Ventura et al., published in &lt;em&gt;Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;, individuals with a thinner “dorsomedial PFC cortex” tended to exhibit stronger left- and right-wing authoritarian traits, after controlling for age, sex, and total brain volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Zmigrod puts it, “the brain differs in function and structure depending on whether you believe a fundamentalist ideology or a more moderate one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we’ve already touched on, these are only correlative observations. More work, and possibly more technology, is required to fully prove causation in the way we have with sleep deprivation. But even then, an answer will likely never be black and white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-working-backward"&gt;Working backward&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belief formation is a complex area that brings neuroscientists, psychologists, and philosophers around the table to shout it out. There will never be one factor we can point to and say, “Yep, this means Timmy will be an extremist.” Nature and nurture, brain and environment, genetics and upbringing all bubble together in a complex, epistemological goulash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s interesting, though, is the corollary of these observations, especially the first two. If we know that cognitive rigidity and emotional volatility incline a person to extremism, we can reverse-engineer the problem. If we raise our children to be less emotionally volatile and help our friends to flex their cognitive worlds, we can hope to reverse a trajectory of increasing extremism. When people retreat to their silos and scream at each other in increasingly loud ideological tribes, the only outcome is bad. Perhaps we can buck the trend. We just need to think of more uses for a Coke bottle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caligula, the notoriously erratic Roman emperor known for his bloodthirsty cruelty, probably also possessed a nerd's knowledge of medicinal plants, according to a new Yale study.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;The study, by the Yale Ancient Pharmacology Program (YAPP), illuminates a brief anecdote about Caligula originally reported by the historian Suetonius in "The Twelve Caesars," a second-century collection of biographies of Roman rulers from Julius Caesar to Domitian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the story, an unnamed Roman senator of praetorian rank who is suffering from an unspecified ailment takes a leave of absence to the Greek spa town of Antikyra in hopes that his health will benefit from treatments made from hellebore—a &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/flowering+plant/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;flowering plant&lt;/a&gt; purported to have medicinal properties. The senator, perhaps pressing his luck, asks Caligula to extend his leave. In response, the emperor has the hapless senator executed, quipping that "a bloodletting was necessary for one whom hellebore had not benefited in all that time."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yale scholars, combining ethnobotanical field data and a close reading of &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/ancient+texts/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;ancient texts&lt;/a&gt;, offer a new understanding of the passage, providing context about Antikyra's place in the Roman Empire and Caligula's familiarity with pharmacology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our work suggests that Antikyra functioned as a kind of Mayo Clinic of the Roman world—a place where affluent and influential Romans visited for &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/medical+treatments/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;medical treatments&lt;/a&gt; not widely available elsewhere," said co-author Andrew Koh, who is YAPP's principal investigator and a research scientist at the Yale Peabody Museum. "It also provides evidence that Caligula, while a tyrant, was more knowledgeable about medicine than has been previously understood."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, &lt;a href="https://www.peasa.eu/site/article/view/56" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;i&gt;Proceedings of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts&lt;/i&gt;, was also co-authored by Trevor Luke, a YAPP faculty affiliate and associate professor of classics at Florida State University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;Medical tourism in the Roman world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Located on the Gulf of Corinth in the Phocis region of central Greece, Roman Antikyra was a modest port town famed for its association with unique hellebore treatments. In ancient times, hellebore was valued as a purgative, a treatment for epilepsy, and a cure for mental illness, the researchers said. Ancient texts describe two varieties of the plant: white hellebore used to treat afflictions of the head and black hellebore used to clear the bowels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examining historical uses of hellebore is difficult in part because ancient peoples, unbound by modern taxonomic classifications, used the term "hellebore" to reference various plants, the researchers said. They also note that ancient identifications of plant life evolved over time and geography, leading to discrepancies in plant names.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further complicating matters, local naturalists in modern Greece use identifications that clearly reference plants that are different than those described in ancient sources. For example, the researchers said, an herbalist in modern-day Antikyra, which today is a small fishing village, identified "elleboro" as dwarf elderberry, which is an altogether different plant than hellebore as described in ancient texts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unlikely that hellebore grew in sufficient quantities around ancient Antikyra to sustain large-scale production of herbal medicines, the researchers concluded. Today, the closest large stands of hellebore they discovered were located more than 2,500 feet above sea level on the southern slopes of Mount Helicon, located southeast of Antikyra. (The hellebore specimens they discovered clearly match depictions in ancient sources.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;/div&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;While not an abundant source of the plant, Antikyra was renowned for the perceived efficacy of the special medicinal hellebore potions prepared there, which were used to treat melancholy, insanity, epilepsy, and gout. Some Antikyran hellebore potions contained another plant, identified as sesamoides in ancient texts, a special ingredient that rendered the purgatives safer to consume, the researchers said, citing an Antikyran medicinal recipe described by Pliny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the early first century BCE, Romans had learned of Antikyra's reputation as a source of especially beneficial hellebore potions through the immigration of Greek physicians to Rome and the lively trade in Greek books, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is remarkable that Antikyra is mentioned in the historical record since it was never an important cultural or economic destination," Luke said. "It was known for hellebore treatments and little else. It's an example of ancient medical tourism. Roman bigwigs traveled there for treatments the same way that the rich and powerful visit Rochester, Minnesota, to avail themselves of the latest medical techniques and therapies available at the Mayo Clinic."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luke and Koh believe the spa town held personal appeal to Caligula: They posit that he likely suffered from an affliction that Antikyran potions were believed to cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers will now analyze the phytochemicals in specimens they recently collected from the Greek landscape to test their efficacy and biochemical interactions in relation to their ancient reputations, Koh said. The analytic approach, he said, combines textual evidence with &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/scientific+evidence/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;scientific evidence&lt;/a&gt; to better understand history and glean lessons from the ancient past that are applicable today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Closely collaborating with Trevor, a top historian of ancient Rome, provides a strong humanistic foundation for our science team to build its work upon," Koh said. "In turn, YAPP's scientific research offers historians a unique opportunity to understand long-studied ancient texts in fresh new ways."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;h2&gt;A more learned Caligula&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suetonius's account of Caligula's life differs from his biographies of other emperors in that it is split into two sections: The first describes Caligula's background and rise to power; the second is devoted to his erratic, cruel, and deranged behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not seeking to rehabilitate Caligula's reputation, the researchers show that he was probably a more learned man than one might infer from the monstrous deeds described by Suetonius. They cite the philosopher Philo of Alexandria's portrayal of Caligula as an emperor endowed with impressive stores of practical knowledge, including a strong understanding of trade routes and seamanship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philo, one of the emperor's most prominent critics, also comments on how Caligula distorted Apollo's art of medicine for malicious purposes, suggesting the emperor possessed detailed pharmacological knowledge, the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also cite several stories demonstrating that Caligula, who has a reputation as an enthusiastic poisoner, indeed possessed a deep knowledge of poisons and antidotes. They note that Caligula was convinced that his father, Germanicus, had succumbed to poisoning, which would have motivated him to study pharmacology if only out of paranoia about suffering a similar fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caligula was familiar with hellebore remedies, Luke and Koh suggest, pointing out that he suffered from epilepsy, insanity, and insomnia—all ailments that ancient people believed the plant could alleviate. Suetonius's anecdote suggests that Caligula also had a sense of how long it should've taken for hellebore to heal the senator.&lt;/p&gt;

																																			&lt;p&gt;Caligula's reference to bloodletting when joking about the doomed senator suggests that he had read Celsus, whose medical treatise "De Medicina" was composed during the reign of Tiberius, Caligula's predecessor, and prescribes bloodletting as an alternative to hellebore in treating epilepsy, the researchers explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's possible that Suetonius is wrong, and that Caligula wasn't ordering the man's execution but simply prescribing an alternative treatment that he had read about or knew from his own experience," Luke said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're presenting a more complete and well-rounded version of Caligula as a ruler who was in tune with the medical wisdom of his day. He's dismissed as a madman, perhaps rightly so, but we show he very likely knew something about hellebore and pharmacology in general."&lt;/p&gt;

"Doing 30 minutes worth of walking for seven days can create a weekly caloric expenditure of 700 to 1,400 calories. These numbers can add up in the long run and result in weight loss for someone who is overweight and was previously sedentary," she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;To figure out how much walking you need to do to lose weight, it can help to identify your resting metabolic rate (RMR), which helps you calculate &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a19982584/how-many-calories-do-i-need/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a19982584/how-many-calories-do-i-need/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="how many calories" data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;how many calories&lt;/a&gt; you need to burn for a calorie deficit.

"If you have pain during your walk, this is your body telling you that you really need to start dedicating time to your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a40059106/mobility-exercises/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a40059106/mobility-exercises/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="joint mobility" data-node-id="14.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;joint mobility&lt;/a&gt;. Everyone should be able to perform a basic life task such as walking without pain." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Doing lunges before a walk can also help, he says. "Performing a set of 10 &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a43375335/how-to-do-walking-lunges/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a43375335/how-to-do-walking-lunges/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="walking lunges" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;walking lunges&lt;/a&gt; every so often can help you build stronger legs, and gain muscle mass," says Wickham. "Gaining lean muscle mass will increase your resting metabolic expenditure, which means you will be burning more calories at rest. This all leads to increased weight loss."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="16" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="16.0"&gt;2. Wear a weighted vest or backpack.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you're looking for more intensity, a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g29641621/best-weighted-vest/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g29641621/best-weighted-vest/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="weighted vest" data-node-id="17.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;weighted vest&lt;/a&gt; or backpack will increase the demand on your body during your walks, says Wickham. "Typically, anything that makes an exercise more challenging will lead to an increase in calories burned," he adds. If vests and backpacks aren't your thing, you can also try wrist weights or another option to boost your workout. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-embed="embed-gallery" data-lazy-id="P0-14" data-node-id="18"

Try tracking your steps with a mobile app or smartwatch. This can help you view your progress and stay focused on your movement goals. "Data tracking can help motivate individuals [toward] goals, accomplishments, and help make up for any deficits throughout the week," says Pata.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="21" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://membership.womenshealthmag.com/womens-health-premium-membership-1.html?cds_tracking_code=whlpanelnav" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-membership-link="https://membership.womenshealthmag.com/womens-health-premium-membership-1.html?cds_tracking_code=whlpanelnav" data-node-id="21.0" data-href="https://membership.womenshealthmag.com/womens-health-premium-membership-1.html?cds_tracking_code=whlpanelnav" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://membership.womenshealthmag.com/womens-health-premium-membership-1.html?cds_tracking_code=whlpanelnav" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Join Women's Health+ today for member-exclusive workout and meal plans." rel="nofollow" class="css-1befp5m e1aq0z090"&gt;Join Women's Health+ today for member-exclusive workout and meal plans.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="22" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="22.0"&gt;4. Alternate between walking and jogging. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;You don't necessarily have to run to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62353915/how-to-lose-weight-after-60/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62353915/how-to-lose-weight-after-60/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="lose weight" data-node-id="23.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt;, but to amp up your walking workouts, try jogging or running slowly for as little as 10 seconds and then walk for two minutes (and repeat). "Adding in short jogs or runs during your walk will help you increase the intensity of your workout, which can help you accelerate your weight loss," Wickham says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;To get creative (and work your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a19919232/lose-thigh-fat/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a19919232/lose-thigh-fat/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="leg muscles" data-node-id="25.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;leg muscles&lt;/a&gt;), you can also practice walking backward, says Wickham. "Walking backward works your quadricep muscles more than walking forward, which can help you maintain healthy and strong knees." Just make sure you're in a safe environment for this (and be aware of other pedestrians). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="26" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="26.0"&gt;5. Create a fun walking playlist. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="27" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Sometimes, all it takes is the right song to pump you up. Playing uplifting tunes while you're out and about can make your walking experience more enjoyable. To fully immerse yourself, Pata suggests creating a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a27511573/best-workout-songs-playlist/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a27511573/best-workout-songs-playlist/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="workout playlist" data-node-id="27.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;workout playlist&lt;/a&gt; of your favorite songs that lasts the length of the walk. It'll fly by before you know it! &lt;br data-node-id="27.3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="28" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="28.0"&gt;6. Don't forget your water bottle. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="29" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a39265125/how-much-water-should-i-drink-to-lose-weight/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a39265125/how-much-water-should-i-drink-to-lose-weight/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Drinking water" data-node-id="29.0" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Drinking water&lt;/a&gt; is an important part of weight loss, so don't forget to bring your favorite bottle along. "Staying properly hydrated is key for optimal health," says Wickham. "The healthier and more hydrated you are, the better your weight loss journey will be." Not to mention, the H2O will keep your energy up and help you log more miles.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="31" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="31.0"&gt;7. Use a food tracker. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="32" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;If you're already taking stock of what you eat with a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a31699213/macro-tracking-apps/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a31699213/macro-tracking-apps/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="food diary app" data-node-id="32.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;food diary app&lt;/a&gt;, it may be helpful to jot down how many calories you're burning by walking. This helps keep you aware of your actions and how it measures up against your weight loss goals, says Pata. That said, counting calories isn't the healthiest option for everyone, so be mindful of choosing a method that works best for you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="33" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="33.0"&gt;8. Stay consistent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="34" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;To reap the full benefits of walking for weight loss, you have to commit to walking at a regular schedule, whether that's once a day or a week. "Health is a lifestyle, not a quick fix," says Wickham. "Find ways that you can add in your walks that will help stay consistent. The more often you walk, the more weight loss you will have." Pro tip: Take the stairs instead of the elevator, get off the bus or train a few stops early and walk home, or invest in an &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g42017752/best-foldable-treadmills/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g42017752/best-foldable-treadmills/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="at-home treadmill" data-node-id="34.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;at-home treadmill&lt;/a&gt; to get your steps in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="35" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="35.0"&gt;9. Purchase a good pair of shoes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="36" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Next, treat yourself to some nice sneakers that you only use for walking. "This creates a 'get-in-the-zone' attitude when you put them on and [encourages] an enjoyable walking experience," Pata says. From &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g46629023/best-walking-shoes-for-flat-feet/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g46629023/best-walking-shoes-for-flat-feet/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="walking shoes for flat feet" data-node-id="36.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;walking shoes for flat feet&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g23517576/best-walking-shoes-for-women/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g23517576/best-walking-shoes-for-women/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="podiatrist-recommended" data-node-id="36.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;podiatrist-recommended&lt;/a&gt; options, there are plenty of pairs to choose from. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="38" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="38.0"&gt;10. Schedule and map out your walks. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="39" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Penciling in your workouts will make it that much more likely that you'll follow through with your goals. "You know what they say...schedule it or you won’t do it. Choosing one time every day to perform your walks will help you stay consistent," says Wickham. "Prioritize your walks and plan around them to ensure you get them in every day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="40" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;You can even plan your walking route with Google Maps so you know exactly how far you'll walk. Just be aware of your surroundings, practice safety, and share your location with someone you trust just in case—especially if you're walking solo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="41" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="41.0"&gt;11. Weather-proof your walks (and have a backup plan). &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="42" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;As a general tip, have the right apparel on hand for rain, cold, or hot weather, says Pata. This will help you stay prepared and less likely to miss a walk due to less-than-ideal conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="43" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;To make sure you still exercise on bad weather days, have a rainy-day back-up plan, like keeping your &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g63175315/best-gym-bags-for-women/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g63175315/best-gym-bags-for-women/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="gym bag" data-node-id="43.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;gym bag&lt;/a&gt; packed and ready to go, or heading to the nearest mall to do some laps, Pata recommends. You’ll be less likely to forget working out altogether if you have a plan B in place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="44" class="body-h3 css-14oqfnb emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="44.0"&gt;12. Invite a friend or family member on your walks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="45" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Asking someone to keep you company while you get some steps in is a great way to stay consistent with your walks &lt;em data-node-id="45.1"&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; maintain your friendships&lt;em data-node-id="45.3"&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, says Wickham.

The new treatment, also known as Riamet&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Baby in some countries, was developed in collaboration with Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) to treat the potentially deadly mosquito-borne disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Eight African countries also participated in the assessment and are now expected to issue rapid approvals under the Swiss agency’s Marketing Authorization for Global Health Products procedure.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Novartis plans to introduce the infant-friendly treatment on a largely not-for-profit basis to increase access in areas where malaria is endemic.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“For more than three decades, we have stayed the course in the fight against malaria, working relentlessly to deliver scientific breakthroughs where they are needed most,” said Vas Narasimhan, CEO of Novartis. “Together with our partners, we are proud to have gone further to develop the first clinically proven malaria treatment for newborns and young babies, ensuring even the smallest and most vulnerable can finally receive the care they deserve.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Until now, there has been no approved malaria treatment for infants weighing less than 4.5 kilograms, leaving a treatment gap. They have instead been treated with formulations intended for use in older children, which may increase the risk of overdose and toxicity. Malaria vaccines are also not approved for the youngest babies.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some 30 million babies are born in areas of malaria risk in Africa every year,&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; with one large survey across West Africa reporting infections ranging between 3.4% and 18.4% in infants younger than 6 months old.&lt;sup&gt;4 &lt;/sup&gt;However, current data on malaria in young babies is extremely limited as they are rarely included in clinical trials of antimalarial agents.&lt;sup&gt;5,6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“The available malaria treatments have only been properly tested in children aged at least 6 months because smaller infants are usually excluded from treatment trials,” said Professor Umberto D'Alessandro, Director of the MRC Unit, The Gambia at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “That matters because neonates and young infants have immature liver function and metabolize some medicines differently, so the dose for older children may not be appropriate for small babies.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The new dose strength designed for young infants was developed by Novartis with the scientific and financial support of MMV, and as part of the &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.pamafrica-consortium.org/__;!!N3hqHg43uw!ouNFvS7qyVz8ZE2FOyM5rfk-qFSAxTXGtocGOhfiP5OYazUJcuXqvnKBet7MJ95U97rEgB4cDc5-NztXXQ$" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="PAMAfrica consortium"&gt;PAMAfrica consortium&lt;/a&gt;, which is co-funded by the &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.edctp.org/__;!!N3hqHg43uw!ouNFvS7qyVz8ZE2FOyM5rfk-qFSAxTXGtocGOhfiP5OYazUJcuXqvnKBet7MJ95U97rEgB4cDc6H_H-0hA$" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="European &amp;amp; Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership"&gt;European &amp;amp; Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.sida.se/en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency"&gt;Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency&lt;/a&gt;. The treatment is dissolvable, including in breast milk, and has a sweet cherry flavor to make it easier to administer. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;“Malaria is one of the world’s deadliest diseases, particularly among children. But with the right resources and focus, it can be eliminated,” said Martin Fitchet, CEO of MMV. “The approval of Coartem Baby provides a necessary medicine with an optimized dose to treat an otherwise neglected group of patients and offers a valuable addition to the antimalarial toolbox.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the CALINA study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Swissmedic approval is based on the Phase II/III &lt;a href="https://www.novartis.com/news/media-releases/novartis-and-medicines-malaria-venture-announce-positive-efficacy-and-safety-data-novel-treatment-babies" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="CALINA"&gt;CALINA&lt;/a&gt; study, which investigated a new ratio and dose of Coartem (artemether-lumefantrine) to account for metabolic differences in babies under 5 kilograms. It is indicated for the treatment of infants and neonates weighing between 2 and less than 5 kilograms with acute, uncomplicated infections due to Plasmodium falciparum or mixed infections including P. falciparum. Coartem is known by the brand name Riamet in Switzerland and some other countries.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About malaria&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by a parasite and spread to humans by some types of mosquitoes. According to the most recent WHO data, there were 263 million cases of malaria and 597,000 deaths in 2023, almost all of them in Africa. Children under 5 years old accounted for about three in four malaria deaths in the region.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Novartis in malaria innovation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Novartis finds breakthroughs for diseases neglected by science and brings innovative medicines to communities on the margins of healthcare, building on 85 years of innovation in global health. Novartis has built the industry’s largest pipeline of treatments to control or eliminate malaria and neglected tropical diseases, backed by nearly USD 490 million in funding for global health R&amp;amp;D since 2021. This includes four new antimalarial compounds with the potential to combat rising drug resistance, one of which is just completing Phase III trials, and another which is a potential single-dose cure. Since 1999, Novartis has delivered more than 1.1 billion treatment courses of antimalarials, mostly at no profit, including 500 million treatments of a child-friendly formulation for babies weighing at least 5 kilograms.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

It generally gets finer.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like with loss, thinning can happen as you head into your 40s because of the associated dip in estrogen. Relatively more testosterone floating around in your system can cause your hair follicles to shrink over time, Dr. Engelman says. Tinier follicles, in turn, sprout finer hairs. But the same genetic predisposition noted above is really what determines how much thinning you’ll see and how rapidly, Dr. Goh notes. So if you inherited androgen-sensitive hair follicles, you’re more likely to wind up with both female pattern hair loss and overall finer strands as you surpass 40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. It may become drier and more brittle in texture.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural hormonal factors aren’t the only thing that can prompt noticeable hair shifts at this stage of life; there are also “all the things &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; do to it,” like applying heat, using chemical products on it, and coloring it, Dr. Shepherd points out, which can change your strands’ overall feel and strength. TBH, harsh styling habits can make hair brittle, frayed, and more prone to breakage at any age, but over the course of years, the hair’s ability to withstand everything we put it through does take a hit, she says. The impact of other everyday factors like exposure to sunlight and environmental pollutants can also build with time, contributing to dryness, &lt;a data-offer-url="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1497981948/kristen-lo-sicco" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1497981948/kristen-lo-sicco"}' href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1497981948/kristen-lo-sicco" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-aps-asin="1497981948" data-aps-asc-tag="self01b-20"&gt;Kristin Lo Sicco, MD&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified dermatologist at NYU Langone who specializes in scalp and hair disorders, tells SELF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, your &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/skin-changes-40s-50s-60s" target="_blank"&gt;skin may produce or retain less natural oil&lt;/a&gt; as you age—due to the same estrogen dip noted above—which can lead to a Sahara-like scalp as well as parched strands, Dr. Goh points out. (It’s the same reason you might find yourself reaching for a &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/best-moisturizers-for-mature-skin" target="_blank"&gt;thicker, more hydrating moisturizer&lt;/a&gt; as you hit your 40s and beyond.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Folks with curly hair might be especially vulnerable to these texture changes, as well as the damage and loss that can follow, because this hair type tends to be more fragile, Dr. Goh notes. “You might not even be doing much chemical processing or intense styling, but with normal exposures and weathering, it can experience breakage at this age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. It could lose some of its previous luster.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shift in the appearance of your hair can go hand-in-hand with the texture changes mentioned above. Less overall moisture coating your skin and scalp also means less of it can travel down each hair shaft and give each piece its shine, Dr. Goh says. And years of exposure to heat, chemicals, and environmental muck can also strip away some of your hair’s natural gloss, leaving it looking duller, Dr. Lo Sicco notes. It could be the first difference you notice or one that comes alongside brittleness and breakage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. And yes, it could sport some (more) grays.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know by now that gray strands can make themselves known before age 40, but after this point, you’re especially likely to notice them. We start to lose the pigment-producing cells in our hair follicles, called melanocytes, as we age, and the ones we have left stop making as much melanin (the tint that colors hair). The reason why isn’t clear, but we do know there’s a genetic component, Dr. Shepherd says. So there’s a good chance you’ll go gray around the same age and to a similar extent as your elders. And your ethnicity could influence when that happens for your family: &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7869811/" target="_blank"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; suggests white people tend to see gray in their mid-30s, followed by Asian folks in their late-30s, and Black people in their mid-40s (though when it comes to other populations, data is lacking).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SELF Magazine</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 18:01:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiXEFVX3lxTE1BbTNOamxWQ0pkOGhOUTd5c1NXeVNsUkFwQVlwZU9TUnIxSjJVVlNSRjFVaktnb2VTcVppS0J6cVlvc01VQnFNOFk4aEdDSTVaM1hXUW8wbGpkdC1x</guid></item><item><title>适得其反的发光噱头：营养师永远不会推荐的5种趋势- Everygirl | Glow-Up Gimmicks That Backfire: 5 Trends Dietitians Would Never Recommend - The Everygirl</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXkFVX3lxTE9TRXJISkVHVHdmdTB3X3FFdkNpdVJFbUlrTGZ1eVEzcUs0dVdmS0JZLU5OaV8yVlNGRGc0LVZOSGdqMWV0aGVaUWJKd1pydC1sdU1ZaldpRWptRkh6UHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Everygirl</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 17:55:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiXkFVX3lxTE9TRXJISkVHVHdmdTB3X3FFdkNpdVJFbUlrTGZ1eVEzcUs0dVdmS0JZLU5OaV8yVlNGRGc0LVZOSGdqMWV0aGVaUWJKd1pydC1sdU1ZaldpRWptRkh6UHc</guid></item><item><title>Scoop ： RFK Jr.暂停预防性服务工作组会议- Axios | Scoop: RFK Jr. halts preventive service task force meeting for now - Axios</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE5OVjZ5Z3FXWmgxczhhblZXNzJMMmF3NWpsOHdqNFJXT1BaVkVSUVk5QkprbTk2dDN1UFJ6SG9qTmlMdktMQU1Hakt1b0dSNFhBTUtlTkc4UHRRTVFQdExNcldWXzdkWjE5anJCY2kwZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Axios</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 17:49:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE5OVjZ5Z3FXWmgxczhhblZXNzJMMmF3NWpsOHdqNFJXT1BaVkVSUVk5QkprbTk2dDN1UFJ6SG9qTmlMdktMQU1Hakt1b0dSNFhBTUtlTkc4UHRRTVFQdExNcldWXzdkWjE5anJCY2kwZw</guid></item><item><title>Fibremaxxing ： TikTok最新的健康趋势真的有意义吗？ -《卫报》 | Fibremaxxing: could TikTok’s latest wellness trend actually make sense?

Indirectly perhaps …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kellogg’s All-Bran?&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe if this was the 1980s. But yes, that kind of fibre. These days it’s more likely to be chia seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are those?&lt;/strong&gt; Edible seeds of Salvia hispanica, a plant native to Mexico. Crucially high in fibre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So is my doormat. &lt;/strong&gt;Eat that if you like, but its nutritional value is questionable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the maxxing bit?&lt;/strong&gt; Getting the most out of something. See also sleepmaxxing, flavormaxxing …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you sure about the double x? I’m thinking about faxing … &lt;/strong&gt;What is that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Something in the 1980s. Never mind …&lt;/strong&gt; It’s probably because it’s from America. Note also the lack of a “u” in “flavor” and it’s spelled “fibermaxxing” there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m guessing this&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gen Z&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; social media trend, right?&lt;/strong&gt; This time, yes, you’re right. It’s all over TikTok …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I knew that was coming!&lt;/strong&gt; The New York Times quotes a 25-year-old wellness content creator called Pamela Corral, who posts TikToks of herself eating foods that are high in fibre, one of which got over 10m views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And what does Pamela have to say about fibre/fiber?&lt;/strong&gt; “I try to eat it often. So I can make videos.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excellent reason. Anything else?&lt;/strong&gt; “Fiber is super-cool – I think more people should be eating fiber.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That is super-cool. I’m just wondering if that counts as good, evidence-based nutritional advice? &lt;/strong&gt;So here’s the thing – and this certainly isn’t true for all social media fads – actual experts kind of agree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go on.&lt;/strong&gt; A &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/10/high-fibre-diets-cut-heart-disease-risk-landmark-study-finds" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;landmark study&lt;/a&gt; published in 2019 found that a fibre-rich diet reduces the risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer by 16-24%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So fibre is super-cool, and more people should be eating it, in other words.&lt;/strong&gt; Yes! Fibre also contributes to a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33641478/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;healthy gut and brain&lt;/a&gt;. And a 7g daily increase in fibre (what you get from approximately half a tin of beans) &lt;a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a7f7cc3ed915d74e622ac2a/SACN_Carbohydrates_and_Health.pdf" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;can lower the risk&lt;/a&gt; of noncommunicable diseases&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(that aren’t spread from person to person) by up to 9%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And if I don’t want the beans, where else &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;can I get&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; my fibre&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; from?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jan/22/the-fibre-phenomenon-30-easy-ways-to-get-your-fill-of-this-life-changing-nutrient" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;So many places.&lt;/a&gt; Starchy foods, whole grains and potatoes with the skin on. Porridge, rather than sugary cereal, for breakfast. Lots of fruit and vegetables …&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I know, the old five a day … &lt;/strong&gt;No you don’t know.

              &lt;p&gt;The popularity of Ozempic and Wegovy as diabetes and weight loss medications has skyrocketed. But how far would people go to avoid one of their major drawbacks—the need for weekly injections? A study out today shows it’s possible to genetically modify mice to make their own Ozempic-like drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists in Japan led the research, which involved gene-editing mice’s livers to produce an internal supply of exenatide, a first-generation GLP-1 drug. The edited mice were able to sustain levels of the drug for several months and experienced greater health improvements compared to controls. Similar gene therapies could possibly allow people to produce GLP-1s and other medications for life one day, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“This study suggests that genome editing could be used to create lasting treatments for complex diseases, potentially reducing the need for frequent medication,” the authors wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00959-8"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday in Communications Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Semaglutide is the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy. It’s part of the latest roster of GLP-1s, a drug class that’s now been around for 20 years. These drugs mimic the natural GLP-1 hormone, which regulates our hunger and insulin production, among other things. Newer agents like semaglutide are far more effective at helping people lose weight and control their blood sugar compared to diet and exercise alone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One major reason why semaglutide is more effective than its earlier cousins is that it’s engineered to stay longer in the body, with its sustained effects lasting about a week. The original exenatide, by contrast, needed to be taken once or twice a day (a weekly extended-release formulation eventually replaced it, though both versions are now &lt;a href="https://www.uhcprovider.com/en/resource-library/news/2024/discontinuation-bydureon-bcise-byetta.html"&gt;discontinued&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S.). A weekly injection schedule can still be difficult for some people to manage, however, which may help explain why many in the real world eventually stop using semaglutide and similar drugs (high costs and common gastrointestinal side effects being other important factors).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pharmaceutical companies are working on &lt;a href="https://www.drugtopics.com/view/long-acting-glp-1-shows-positive-results-in-phase-2-study"&gt;longer-lasting formulations&lt;/a&gt; of GLP-1 drugs. The study researchers, based at the University of Osaka, are tinkering with a different approach, however. They argue that it’s possible to safely induce our cells to make certain drugs on their own, including GLP-1s, eliminating the need for continuous dosing completely.&lt;/p&gt;

Using a CRISPR-based method, the researchers then inserted a gene into the liver cells of these mice with the instructions for making exenatide. As hoped, the treated mice produced levels of exenatide detectable in their blood for up to 28 weeks. Compared to untreated mice on the same diet, they also ate less food, gained less weight, and had improved insulin sensitivity. The treatment also appeared to be safe, with no noticeable side effects, such as interference with the mice’s production of natural GLP-1.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“We hope that our design of a one-time genetic treatment can be applied to many conditions that do not have exact genetic causes,” said senior study author Keiichiro Suzuki in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1090112"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The findings are, of course, only a proof of concept. Gene therapy is still in its early clinical days and is largely only used in humans today to treat rare diseases caused by specific mutations. While GLP-1 drugs are generally tolerable, it would take a considerable amount of work to confirm the safety and practicality of editing people’s cells to produce them. A lifelong therapy might also come with lifelong side effects, for example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That said, it’s likely that some people would jump at the chance to take such treatments if they’re safe and reliable. And at least one pharmaceutical company is taking a shot at it. Fractyl Health has been developing its own GLP-1 gene therapy, which targets cells in the pancreas instead of the liver. In 2023, the company &lt;a href="https://www.fiercebiotech.com/research/fractyls-gene-therapy-obesity-outdoes-semaglutide-weight-loss-mice"&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; data showing that its gene-edited mice actually lost more weight than mice simply given semaglutide. This May, the company &lt;a href="https://ir.fractyl.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fractyl-health-advances-rejuvar-gene-therapy-platform-submission"&gt;submitted&lt;/a&gt; paperwork to European health regulators for the first human trial of its gene therapy, which it expects to begin next year.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;For now, semaglutide and other conventional GLP-1 drugs will remain atop the obesity treatment throne. In the not-so-distant future, though, who knows?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;According to a recent analysis of data from CVDPREVENT, a national audit of GP records to support primary care, women diagnosed with cardiovascular disease are 50 per cent less likely to receive a prescription for lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) such as statins (the most commonly prescribed) than men. Around 200,000 women with cardiovascular disease had a record of high cholesterol, and no recent LLT prescription. According to the NHS, a total cholesterol (TC) level over 6.2 mmol/L is defined as high, while a level of 5 mmol/L or below is considered healthy for adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jules Payne, chief executive of the cholesterol charity Heart UK, says: “With such discrepancies in access to cholesterol management support, the system is failing women in achieving their target cholesterol levels, even after a CVD&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;diagnosis. Real change is needed, from early prevention through to management of cholesterol after menopause or a heart attack.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/heart-health/heart-health-risks-menopause/"&gt;gender discrepancy&lt;/a&gt; was illustrated when it was revealed that entering identical heart symptoms for women and men into a NHS virtual GP app called Babylon GP at Hand,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;resulted in starkly different diagnoses. The AI algorithm told a 60-year-old female smoker reporting chest pain and nausea that she was having a panic attack, while a man of the same age reporting the same symptoms was told he may be having a heart attack and advised to go to A&amp;amp;E.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study in the journal&lt;em&gt; Heart &lt;/em&gt;in 2024 showed that women, black people and people from low-income households are &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/14/female-heart-attack-victims-half-likely-men-receive-treatment/"&gt;less likely to be offered heart surgery&lt;/a&gt; in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Women are less likely to have treatments such as stents, heart surgery, medicines such as statins and access to cardiac rehabilitation, which can reduce the risk of a heart attack happening again,” adds Dr Babu-Narayan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they do have heart surgery, the results are not as good. Women are more likely to die in the year after heart surgery. According to BHF-funded research, conducted by Leeds University School of Medicine, differences in care for women were estimated to have contributed to at least 8,200 avoidable deaths in England and Wales between 2002 and 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shernaz, who lives in central London, explains that she had none of the associated risk factors for CVD, she was a non-smoker who hardly drank alcohol, and had never been tested for high cholesterol, so she went to a female physiotherapist when she started getting a pain in her arm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of research focusing on obesity, what happens in the body when we lose weight, and why losing weight can improve health, is still poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now a new study, published in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_5214412389925563026&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-09233-2&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fweight-loss-may-rejuvenate-fat-tissues-clearing-away-aged-cells" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09233-2" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-09233-2&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fweight-loss-may-rejuvenate-fat-tissues-clearing-away-aged-cells" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday (July 9), provides clues as to what may actually be happening. It suggests that the weight loss does more than shave off pounds — it changes fat on a cellular level, rewiring how the tissue is metabolized and maybe even "rejuvenating" it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also offers insights into why losing weight does not necessarily &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.obesity.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IOC-5-Principles.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.obesity.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IOC-5-Principles.pdf" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;eliminate all the health problems&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; associated with obesity. The study found that some markers of poor health in obesity, such as cells that drive inflammation, were not resolved after weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we're excited by is being able to really understand the 'yins and yangs' of weight loss," study lead author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/w.scott" target="_blank" data-url="https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/w.scott" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;William Scott&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an obesity researcher from Imperial College London, told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to this kind of research, "we may, in the future, be able to develop drugs that target the good bits, but also block the harmful bits that get hardwired by obesity," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="zooming-in-on-fat-cells-3"&gt;Zooming in on fat cells&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand what may be happening in fat cells when people lose weight, Scott and his colleagues collected samples of subcutaneous abdominal fat — fat that grows under the skin around the belly — from 25 volunteers with obesity before and after weight-loss surgery. The samples were collected between five and 18 months post-surgery, when the participants had lost an average of 55 pounds (25 kilograms) and were still in an "active" weight loss phase, said Scott.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/fat-cells-have-a-memory-of-obesity-study-finds" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/fat-cells-have-a-memory-of-obesity-study-finds"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fat cells have a 'memory' of obesity, study finds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-5228gmPa9b7HXcd2CULs9Z" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-5228gmPa9b7HXcd2CULs9Z slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The samples were compared to tissues collected from 24 lean volunteers whose &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/bmi-health-weight" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/bmi-health-weight"&gt;&lt;u&gt;body mass indices&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were in the "normal" range. They also compared the data to a previously published &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_8076802150363021885&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-022-04518-2&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fweight-loss-may-rejuvenate-fat-tissues-clearing-away-aged-cells" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04518-2" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-022-04518-2&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fweight-loss-may-rejuvenate-fat-tissues-clearing-away-aged-cells" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;"atlas" of all the white fat in the body&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which also cataloged the chemical processes occurring in that fat tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists then studied how weight loss affected cell activity. They measured which genes were active in each cell by looking at their RNA molecules. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-RNA.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-RNA.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;RNA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a cousin of DNA that copies down information from genes and serves as the blueprint for proteins, so looking at which RNAs are present and how many can be used as a measure of gene activity. This method, called single nucleus RNA sequencing, reveals what the cells were about to do when sampled, and how they were interacting with each other at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting that level of insight into the fat tissue is important because, contrary to popular belief, it is not a monolithic, passive mass. Instead, it is made up of many cell types — fat cells (also called adipocytes), immune cells, vascular cells and nerve cells — that work together. These diverse cells send &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/how-does-the-brain-regulate-body-weight" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/how-does-the-brain-regulate-body-weight"&gt;&lt;u&gt;signals to the body and brain&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, helping regulate metabolism, appetite and overall health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, the study analyzed the RNA expression of more than 170,000 cells in the fat tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="reversing-aging-and-recycling-fatty-molecules-3"&gt;Reversing aging and recycling fatty molecules&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed that fat tissue in larger bodies tends to be prone to "senescence," meaning some cells act aged and are more damaged than younger cells. Scientists suspect these senescent cells may fuel the diseases associated with obesity, as they promote inflammation and fibrosis, or scarring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in weight loss, that senescence seems to be reversed, and the tissue appears healthier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The body clears damaged and harmful cells and, in effect, is rejuvenating our tissues," Scott said. "We weren't really surprised by that," as this had been hinted at in other studies, "but we were surprised by the extent to which that seems to happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, weight loss seems to change the way the fat cells interact with fatty molecules, called lipids. High lipid levels in the blood can harm the body. When storage capacity within fat tissue is exceeded, lipids accumulate in other tissues like the liver and pancreas, likely contributing to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34757-insulin-resistance-develop-diabetes-heart-disease.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34757-insulin-resistance-develop-diabetes-heart-disease.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, liver disease and diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new research suggests that fat cells not only break down lipids, but also recycle them, using the components to make new fatty molecules. This process may burn energy, helping with weight loss, and may also keep harmful fats from building up in other organs and causing problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some cellular changes associated with obesity weren't reversed, however. The researchers noticed that immune cells, which infiltrate fat tissue and drive disease in obesity, were still present after weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found that obesity hard wires some of the processes in the cells," Scott said. "There's a memory in fat tissue." That means that losing weight is "never going to be as good" as maintaining a healthy weight in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/andrew-hoy.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/about/our-people/academic-staff/andrew-hoy.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Andrew Hoy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a lipid metabolism researcher at the University of Sydney who wasn't involved in the study, told Live Science by email that the method the team used doesn't capture all the complex cellular interactions that may be at play. As such, it can't say for sure that fat cells are being "rejuvenated" or that immune cells remain after weight loss, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the study only looked at subcutaneous fat, but visceral fat, which surrounds internal organs, is known to be more closely linked with disease. So studying visceral fat may be more helpful for determining what drives disease in obesity, Hoy argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scott added that the study cannot explain what drives the observed changes in fat tissues during weight gain or loss. He hopes that further research would help show what is happening at different stages of weight loss and gain, as well as when weight plateaus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may also be that the weight loss surgery helped usher the cellular changes and weight loss at the same time, rather than the weight loss itself driving the changes, suggested &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://francescorubino.co.uk/" target="_blank" data-url="https://francescorubino.co.uk/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Francesco Rubino&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a metabolic surgery researcher at King's College London in the U.K. who wasn't involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told Live Science in an email that he thinks the work supports the idea that dramatic weight loss, by itself, should not be the sole goal of obesity treatment. His and other research suggests that gains to metabolic health can happen even with modest weight loss, and that the metabolic improvements are the important bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We assume that there is a proportion between weight loss and outcomes. That, I think, is a fundamental mistake," Rubino told Live Science. "You shouldn't judge the success of treatment based only on weight loss, because you might lose less weight and still achieve fantastic benefits," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-5228gmPa9b7HXcd2CULs9Z-pkvNvxRKFNY2O40hidZgAbL2BRjj1YGS" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-5228gmPa9b7HXcd2CULs9Z-pkvNvxRKFNY2O40hidZgAbL2BRjj1YGS slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

And, you know, it’s terribly unfortunate so much of this work has been now stopped by this administration,” Osterholm said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JD2WDOHCIBACLPDEIH2BEIRU3Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;However, the multibillion-dollar RECOVER Covid Initiative launched by the NIH allowed researchers to set up clinics and study long covid at a “much bigger scale than they ever have been before,” said &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1841334810/leora-horwitz" target="_blank"&gt;Leora Horwitz&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of population health and medicine at the New York University School of Medicine. “I think they’ve put us in a good position now to recognize similar sorts of conditions of future as-yet-unknown pandemics.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LDVR3ZTAKVHO3HKW6QCVHYFSGM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The infrastructure set up by RECOVER has allowed for the long-term tracking of in-depth health data and could be a model for what to test in future pandemics, said Horwitz, who co-leads the branch of RECOVER studying adult patients, which includes almost 15,000 participants at 83 sites across 33 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="E27KC5LVENCBRC2PPJHYEWSDNY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;More important, there is now broader recognition that a subset of people can develop prolonged symptoms from infections, Horwitz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3SMGKKMHOREPDFMAP4LKXEQLSM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Experts said that many of these developments and understanding were driven by &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/03/27/long-covid-brain-cognition/" target="_blank"&gt;fierce advocacy from the community of long covid patients&lt;/a&gt;, who have prompted politicians to act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X7CP3QX2YRFPTEVKMWM5NRQP7Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;However, the U.S. health care system remains strained even without contending with another pandemic, said Osterholm, who pointed to a projected&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aamc.org/news/press-releases/new-aamc-report-shows-continuing-projected-physician-shortage" target="_blank"&gt;shortage of physicians&lt;/a&gt; and other health care professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="UMK5KCVBGJF4DOGSNOR4LVT4UU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Fixing the health care system is important, he said. “If we don’t invest right now, the bottom line is we’re going to just do a repeat all over again in the next pandemic,” Osterholm said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YXBUVQ76TFBX7O65YONQG5WVFA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At the same time, many of the public health tools for mitigating infection spread and severity — and therefore risk of long-term symptoms — have become increasingly politicized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3DFLKAEDMRDZXNHLM3U7XYYURM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Masking, vaccination, antivirals and improved indoor air quality have all helped combat covid and are valuable tools to implement should another pandemic arise, Al-Aly said. But people are increasingly tuning out these public health conversations and resisting being reminded of the pandemic,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“like &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/03/13/brain-memory-pandemic-covid-forgetting/" target="_blank"&gt;almost collective amnesia&lt;/a&gt;,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WGIKHEYBXRGR5P3XXNVP726MQI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“We paid a heavy price for this knowledge, and literally &lt;a href="https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/deaths" target="_blank"&gt;more than 1.1 million people died&lt;/a&gt;” in the United States, Al-Aly said. Now it’s a “question of whether there will be the political will and also the public sentiment to actually utilize this information for public good,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6TC66RU2FZGGLLCLCBGYGY3CMI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This story is the last of a three-part series on five years of long covid.

                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PUTNAM COUNTY, Ind. — The first case of &lt;a href="https://www.wthr.com/health" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;measles in central Indiana&lt;/a&gt; was confirmed in Putnam County.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Putnam County Health Department said there is not an outbreak and the risk to the public remains low.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement posted online, the health department encouraged people to get the MMR vaccine (measles, mumps, rubella).&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generally, the health department said children should get the vaccine around age 1 and a second dose before kindergarten.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms to look for include:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever (over 101°F)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cough, runny nose, or red eyes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rash that usually starts on the face and spreads&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Small white spots inside the mouth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you suspect measles, contact your doctor before visiting the office so steps can be taken to limit the spread.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those most at risk are babies and those with weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The US is having its worst year for measles in more than three decades&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is having its worst year for &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-vaccination-rfk-mmr-e5d928e41fd6b3dc6ade087662d61c5c"&gt;measles spread&lt;/a&gt; in more than three decades, with a total of 1,288 cases nationally and another six months to go in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday that the national case count surpassed 2019, when there were 1,274 cases for the year and the country almost lost its status of having eliminated the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccines-measles-polio-whooping-cough-rubella-af4cd1aef8f408a960601df6372f9c32"&gt;vaccine-preventable illness.&lt;/a&gt; That could happen this year if the virus has &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-new-mexico-outbreak-mmr-vaccine-6cfda9a944084c390bc70f0e7a37a426"&gt;nonstop spread for 12 months&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year's outbreaks, some of them interconnected, started five months ago in undervaccinated communities in West Texas. Three people have died — two children in Texas and an adult in New Mexico — and dozens of people have been hospitalized. Public health experts maintain the true case count may be higher than state health departments have confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-new-mexico-outbreak-mmr-vaccine-6cfda9a944084c390bc70f0e7a37a426"&gt;North America&lt;/a&gt; has three other major measles outbreaks, with 2,966 cases in Chihuahua state, Mexico, 2,223 cases in Ontario, Canada and 1,230 in Alberta, Canada. Twelve other states have current confirmed outbreaks of three or more people — Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Utah — and four other states saw their outbreaks end.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine is 97% effective at preventing measles after two doses.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization said in 2000 that measles had been eliminated from the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC identified 22 outbreaks in 2019, the largest being two separate clusters in New York — 412 in New York state and 702 in New York City. These were linked because as measles was spreading through &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6840e2.htm"&gt;close-knit Orthodox Jewish communities&lt;/a&gt;, the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a similar situation in North America this year, where the Canada, Mexico and Texas outbreaks stem from large Mennonite communities in the regions. Mennonite churches do not formally discourage vaccination, though &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-texas-rfk-vaccines-8cf4641b04731c713edb524ca943490c"&gt;more conservative Mennonite communities&lt;/a&gt; historically have low vaccination rates and a distrust of government.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent study found childhood vaccination rates against measles fell after the COVID-19 pandemic &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-vaccine-mmr-covid-exemptions-87cbfe44d8599b68408861f9b62421ed"&gt;in nearly 80% of the more than 2,000 U.S. counties&lt;/a&gt; with available data, including in states that are &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-vaccination-us-rfk-mmr-8fb86f56b0892408680daae4a52047e6"&gt;battling outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; this year.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/vaccinations-kindergarten-exemptions-cdc-1c0f9a196a70491fccf48b9125090de0"&gt;92.7%&lt;/a&gt; of kindergarteners in the U.S. had the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine in the 2023-2024 school year, below the 95% needed to prevent outbreaks. In Gaines County, Texas, the epicenter of the Texas outbreak, only 82% of kindergarteners were up-to-date with MMR vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State and federal leaders have for years kept funding &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-texas-vaccines-funding-cuts-5785985d6b74024b0502f6a2fc1576e2"&gt;stagnant&lt;/a&gt; for local public health departments' vaccination programs that are tasked with reversing the trend.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What we’re seeing with measles is a little bit of a ‘canary in a coal mine,'" said Lauren Gardner, leader of Johns Hopkins University's independent measles and COVID tracking databases. "It’s indicative of a problem that we know exists with vaccination attitudes in this county and just, I think, likely to get worse.”&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

                The high number of U.S. measles cases this year has been fueled by a Texas outbreak. Three people have died.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;The U.S. has reported 1,288 measles cases this year — the highest number in 33 years, according to the latest figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The last time the U.S. saw more measles cases was in 1992, eight years before the disease was declared eliminated in the country.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We're seeing a lot more measles transmission than we are used to," says &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/faculty/3525/caitlin-m-rivers" target="_blank"&gt;Caitlin Rivers&lt;/a&gt;. She's the director of the Center for Outbreak Response Innovation at Johns Hopkins University, which has its own &lt;a href="https://cori.centerforhealthsecurity.org/resources/measles-outbreak-response" target="_blank"&gt;measles dashboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Measles is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/28/nx-s1-5312088/measles-texas-outbreak-contagious-spread" target="_blank"&gt;most infectious diseases&lt;/a&gt; known to humans. And more importantly, it's preventable. And so we really hate to see this resurgence of a preventable virus," Rivers says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Texas outbreak fuels case numbers&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since the start of the year, measles cases have been confirmed by more than three dozen states plus the District of Columbia. The largest outbreak by far&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/07/nx-s1-5312107/how-a-measles-outbreak-overwhelmed-a-small-west-texas-town" target="_blank"&gt; is in Texas.&lt;/a&gt; The state has reported 753 measles cases this year. Across the U.S., 155 people have been hospitalized, and three people have died.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And while the Texas outbreak has slowed significantly, across the country, Rivers says the U.S. is now seeing more cases on a weekly basis than in previous years.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The Texas outbreak started in January. At one point, Rivers says, the state was reporting 15 to 20 new cases of measles per day, raising fears that, if the outbreak continued the U.S. would lose its "elimination" status, which is a technical term in public health that means the disease has not had a constant transmission for a 12-month period or longer. She says that's less likely to happen now, given that the state is only reporting a handful of cases per week.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But that doesn't mean it won't happen in the near future, says&lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1972558187/adam-j-ratner" target="_blank"&gt; Dr. Adam Ratner&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatric infectious disease physician in New York City and the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/11/nx-s1-5292478/measles-vaccination-kids-health-disease" target="_blank"&gt;author of Booster Shots&lt;/a&gt;, a history of the fight against measles.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We are in great danger of losing our measles elimination status, if not this year, then almost certainly in the coming years," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Ratner points to kindergarten vaccination rates, which have been falling nationwide for years and are currently at 92.7%. In some communities, vaccination rates are much lower, creating pockets of opportunity for measles to spread. The CDC says a 95% vaccination rate threshold is needed to protect communities against measles outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What we're seeing now is, as vaccine hesitancy has grown, particularly during and after the COVID pandemic, those outbreaks are becoming more frequent and larger," Ratner says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Lasting impacts&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The measles milestone comes the same week that some of the&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/07/08/nx-s1-5459978/rfk-jr-vaccine-pediatrics-public-health-lawsuit" target="_blank"&gt; nation's leading medical associations&lt;/a&gt; sued Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., charging him with what they characterize as an effort to undermine trust in vaccines among the American public.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In a statement to NPR, Health and Human Services Department spokesperson Andrew Nixon said, "CDC continues to recommend MMR vaccines as the best way to protect against measles. The decision to vaccinate is a personal one." He added that the CDC continues to provide vaccines to communities dealing with outbreaks as requested.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Before widespread vaccination eliminated the disease in the U.S., pretty much everyone got measles in childhood. And between 400 to 500 children used to die from the disease each year. It can also cause permanent disabilities — the disease is still a leading cause of blindness worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This year, Rivers says, 1 in 8 cases in the U.S. have resulted in hospitalization.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So although many people think of measles as a mild illness and for the most part it is, it can also &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/03/17/nx-s1-5328765/measles-outbreak-health-risk" target="_blank"&gt;cause severe illness,&lt;/a&gt;" Rivers says. "That's an important reminder for parents who are on the fence that this virus is definitely something that's worth preventing."&lt;/p&gt;

Melanoma, the deadliest form, is expected to rise by 6% in 2025, and the incidence of melanoma in people under 30, especially women, is increasing faster than in any other age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excessive sun exposure is the leading cause of skin cancer, which is why it most commonly occurs on the face, scalp, ears, neck, upper chest and hands. “These are the areas that receive the most cumulative sun exposure over a person’s lifetime,” says Dr. David C. Reid, professor and chair of dermatology at the Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But skin cancer can also develop in areas that aren’t regularly exposed to the sun, including the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, genitals, buttocks, eyelids, in the skin under the nails, and inside the mouth or nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People are often surprised that certain areas of the body that they think are protected from the sun—such as the scalp and the tops of the feet—can still get significant exposure to the sun’s ultraviolet rays, says Dr. Kathleen Suozzi, chief of surgical dermatology at the Yale School of Medicine and Yale Cancer Center. But, she says, “while UV radiation is the leading cause of most skin cancers, it’s not the only factor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What else causes skin cancer, besides the sun?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic factors, immunosuppression (especially for those who have had organ transplants), and chronic &lt;a href="https://time.com/6269070/inflammation-deadly-diseases/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt; can all raise a person’s risk. So can past injuries; skin cancer can develop in previously injured areas, such as wounds or scars, without sun exposure, Reid says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Occupational exposure to certain types of chemicals—such as those encountered by firefighters and industrial workers—can also increase the risk of developing skin cancer, he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/7287371/what-is-lipoprotein-lpa-cholesterol/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Genetic Cholesterol That Can Impact Your Heart Health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Genetic Cholesterol That Can Impact Your Heart Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viruses, such as the human papillomavirus (&lt;a href="https://time.com/7176632/what-does-hpv-diagnosis-mean-sti/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HPV;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;HPV&lt;/a&gt;), are a common cause of genital skin cancers on the vulva, vagina, anus, and penis. “HPV is a super common virus—and it’s not just sexually transmitted,” says Dr. Anthony Rossi, a dermatologist and Mohs surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and chief medical officer at the skin health company Joya. It can also spread through non-sexual contact with infected skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And indoor tanning is a major contributor to skin cancer. Experts &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34885049/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:believe;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;believe&lt;/a&gt; that the increased popularity of tanning beds and artificial sunlamps is a main reason why melanoma is rising among young people. People who have tanned indoors at any point in their lives have a 29% higher risk of developing basal cell carcinoma and an 83% increased risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma compared to people who never have, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/skin-cancer-facts/#nonmelanoma" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Skin Cancer Foundation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Skin Cancer Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The three main types of skin cancer and where they’re found&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basal cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer, and it’s typically related to chronic sun exposure. That’s why it’s often found on the face (including the nose, lips, and cheeks), ears, and neck, says Dr. Susan Massick, associate clinical professor of dermatology at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. While it’s “not particularly aggressive, it can become more problematic if it’s ignored, untreated, or allowed to progress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squamous cell carcinoma is the second-most common kind, and it’s typically found on the face, ears, neck, lips and backs of the hands, though it can appear anywhere on the body. “Squamous cell carcinoma favors sun-exposed areas, but can also arise in scars, chronic ulcers, or from viruses, in sun-protected areas,” Reid says. While it’s highly treatable when identified in an early stage, squamous cell carcinoma can spread to surrounding tissues if it’s not addressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/7284907/ovarian-cyst-diagnosis-treatment/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What to Do If You Get Diagnosed with an Ovarian Cyst;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;What to Do If You Get Diagnosed with an Ovarian Cyst&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melanoma, which is the third most common type of skin cancer, tends to also occur in sun-exposed areas, particularly on the chest, torso, and back in men and the legs in women, Rossi notes. But it can also develop in non-sun-exposed areas such as the mucous membranes in the nose and mouth and the eye, Massick says. It’s the deadliest form of skin cancer because it can spread to other areas of the body if it’s not detected and treated early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to prevent skin cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the connections between skin cancer and sun exposure, it’s important to use a &lt;a href="https://time.com/3924609/sunscreen-spf-uva-uvb/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:broad-spectrum sunscreen;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;broad-spectrum sunscreen&lt;/a&gt; on your skin with an SPF of 30 or higher on a daily basis throughout the year. When spending time outside, reapply sunscreen every two hours, and be sure to apply enough: the amount should fill a shot glass for the whole body, plus two to three fingertips worth on the face and neck, Rossi says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When spending long periods of time outdoors, the Skin Cancer Foundation also recommends wearing UPF protective clothing, including wide-brimmed hats, and sunglasses that block at least 99% of UVA and UVB light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/7281684/is-seltzer-water-bad-for-you/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Is Seltzer Water Good or Bad for You?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Is Seltzer Water Good or Bad for You?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use these strategies when you’re driving, too, because UVA penetrates through window glass, Rossi says. You may even want to wear driving gloves to protect the skin on your hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s also helpful to check the daily &lt;a href="https://enviro.epa.gov/envirofacts/uv/search" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UV Index;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;UV Index&lt;/a&gt;, which is included in smartphone weather apps,” says Reid. “A score of 3 or higher means it’s time to take precautions” such as seeking shade during the midday hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always steer clear of tanning beds, Suozzi advises, and avoid UV exposure in gel manicures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to spot potential signs of skin cancer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is to do monthly skin self-exams, making a concerted effort to check out the skin all over your body, including on your back, scalp, and genital areas. (You may want to enlist a partner’s help for these hard-to-see areas—or use mirrors strategically.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind: “If you have light-colored hair, red hair, or thinning hair, it doesn’t offer as much photoprotection,” Rossi says. That’s why it’s important to continuously part the hair during skin checks so you can see as much of your scalp as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And don’t forget to examine your nails and the bottoms of your feet, Reid says. A skin cancer subtype called acral lentiginous melanoma tends to appear on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or under the nails, “and it is more common in individuals with darker skin tones.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://time.com/7263920/what-are-recurring-dreams/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Why Do I Keep Having Recurring Dreams?;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Why Do I Keep Having Recurring Dreams?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people have heard of the &lt;a href="https://www.aad.org/public/diseases/skin-cancer/find/at-risk/abcdes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:ABCDE’s for identifying suspected melanoma;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;ABCDE’s for identifying suspected melanoma&lt;/a&gt; in moles or pigmented spots: A is for asymmetry (meaning one half looks different from the other), B is for border (the spot has an irregular or poorly defined border), C is for color (meaning the spot has color variations, such as shades of tan, brown, black, white, red, or blue), D is for diameter (spots that are larger than the size of a pencil eraser can signal melanoma), and E is for evolving, which means the spot is changing in size, color, or shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The warning signs are different for other forms of skin cancer. Basal cell carcinoma may look like a pearly bump, a sore that doesn’t heal, or a pink, scaly patch, Massick says. “Squamous cell carcinoma might also appear as a pink, scaly patch, a wart-like growth or a rough, thickened area of skin that bleeds, scabs, or crusts”—and doesn’t heal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you develop any of these skin signs and they persist for a couple of months, see a dermatologist. “It’s not just moles—any persistent skin change should raise suspicion,” says Suozzi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, it’s wise to see a dermatologist once a year for a full-body skin check, Rossi says. Your doctor can then do a biopsy of anything unusual and send it to a lab to diagnose or rule out cancer. The key is to catch any abnormal spots early—wherever they arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact us&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;a href="mailto:letters@time.com?subject=(READER%20FEEDBACK)%20What%20Most%20People%20Overlook%20About%20Skin%20Cancer&amp;amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F7300863%2Fwhat-to-know-about-skin-cancer%2F" data-ylk="slk:letters@time.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;letters@time.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 15:24:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE54VFlSS1ZscFlPMlFBYXRpd25UemE1cGFBbjdZcHNTa0xQSHl2Ml9TQmh2TXVtc0RJTUZnbm81RFE5ck5KTzFzNXctOFZjdVhiUDVBeGxRWFdiZDBueVVFLUZfa3dVd1o3WWdRaW5JYW1vcURUY0E</guid></item><item><title>儿童在接受罕见遗传疾病的实验性治疗后再次行走- STAT | Child walks again after receiving experimental treatment for rare genetic condition - STAT</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixgFBVV95cUxNdlNFMjAzclJMZXdwNzFfUFBsaW8zMmVzNEpQaTJxaC1qeU1lSE0xYS1fNW5jV1FzM3A5b05yUFFGN05LdFZ4ZVNKNEVKUFJQaFdkRWRMZm85MlJvNlo1Wm5FdmpvckNYM29KbHV4SlRNQTdreEZEdC1aVUo5TlpyUFF0Y2dYcFg0aHlQZEhXNVo4TV9CX3VLTl9pVUlPcmZiTDNZWUtSdUU5ajdIdGVWZjJtTGxoSGppell4a2I1bF9iS2hualE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In what experts are calling a “dream come true,” scientists used a recent biochemical discovery to help an 8-year-old boy with a rare genetic condition regain mobility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers from NYU Langone demonstrated, in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09246-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study published in Nature on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, how a chemical precursor to a commonly available enzyme, CoQ10, can help brain cells overcome a rare genetic condition that severely hobbles cells’ energy production process. Without treatment, the boy’s condition is known to deteriorate rapidly and could be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That is basic science translating into clinical medicine, a dream come true,” Navdeep Chandel, a professor of medicine at Northwestern University, told STAT. He was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This study revolves around science’s understanding of how cells produce energy — a task performed by the so-called powerhouse of the cell, the mitochondria. To make energy, the mitochondria needs coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). A rare genetic deficiency could interfere with body’s ability to make the enzyme, causing HPDL deficiency — a fatal condition characterized by spastic movements, neurodevelopmental delays, and even paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;HPDL deficiency can be hereditary — when a child inherits two copies of the mutated HPDL gene, one from each parent. This progressive childhood-onset movement disorder has multiple variants that can result in different ages of onset, clinical presentations, and survival. Children with the most severe clinical presentations of this disease die at a median age of &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1098360024002831?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;18 months&lt;/a&gt;. In the case of the boy that NYU Langone neurologists treated, he did not have the onset of symptoms until later into his childhood, despite having inherited the mutated HPDL gene. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;For years, physicians have been trying to treat such conditions in which mitochondrial function is reduced by &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24495877/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;supplementing the body&lt;/a&gt; with CoQ10 enzyme. Found on most pharmacy shelves, CoQ10 is a wellness supplement that can help with &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-coenzyme-q10/art-20362602" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;heart health, energy, and brain health&lt;/a&gt;, though the Food and Drug Administration has not approved CoQ10 for treating any medical condition. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s safe. It’s reasonably effective at treating symptoms outside of the brain, but almost completely ineffective at treating symptoms within the brain, because it doesn’t get through the blood-brain barrier,” said Michael Pacold, an associate professor of radiation oncology at NYU Langone and one of the study authors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Think of the blood-brain barrier as the brain’s plastic wrap — keeping harmful chemicals out. But it’s almost too good because many drugs cannot penetrate it. That’s where Pacold’s lab’s earlier discovery helped. In a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03865-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2021 study&lt;/a&gt;, it discovered one of the first steps to how the cell makes CoQ10. This involves the HPDL gene and its role in making 4-HB — an essential building block cells need to make CoQ10. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pacold and his team found that 4-HB, the precursor to CoQ10, could not only cross the blood-brain barrier and reach the brain, but it was able to restore standing and walking function in mice that had HPDL gene deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Instead of giving CoQ10, we figured, why not give the cell the building blocks, so that the cell can make it itself?” Pacold told STAT.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The boy, who received the treatment, had normal development until August 2023, when he started displaying uncontrollable spastic movements in both of his ankles while playing soccer. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our son’s condition changed dramatically in a short period. He went from being the fastest runner in his class and an avid soccer player to struggling just to walk, often limping and experiencing frequent falls,” the boy’s parents said in an emailed response to questions from STAT. The family did not want the boy’s or their name used. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By November 2023, he could not stand on his own and needed a wheelchair. The family, who had lost two other children to the same genetic condition, contacted a physician who specializes in HPDL deficiency, and was connected with doctors and researchers at NYU.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Claire Miller, a pediatric neurologist at NYU Langone, and a team of neurologists met with Pacold to explore the possibility of administering the experimental treatment to the boy. Miller, also an author on the study, said the research data from Pacold’s team was “very convincing.” Researchers then got formal approval from the FDA on compassionate use grounds. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Still, it was an experimental treatment that had only ever been tested in mice, and the family knew it could involve unknown risks. “It was one of the hardest decisions we’ve ever made, but doing nothing felt riskier,” the boy’s parents said. “We saw how quickly our son was declining and knew we had to act. After speaking with doctors and doing our research, we got hope and confidence to step into the unknown.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nineteen days after the family met with the team of neurologists and scientists, the boy received his first treatment — 4HB dissolved in water and taken orally. He has been tolerating the treatment well for over a year. He has enjoyed long walks, hikes, and even celebrated two birthdays, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To Miller, who specializes in treating children with movement disorders, the boy’s recovery meant more than how effective the treatment was. “Movement is identity and personality,” she told STAT. “The beautiful thing about movement is that’s how we express our identities and our personalities.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For researchers, this study is a breakthrough in the so-called bench-to-bedside pipeline — taking a basic biochemical discovery and translating it to a promising treatment for a rare and fatal childhood disease. “We all dream of this as scientists. And every morning I pinch myself … is this really a dream?” said Pacold.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chandel, the Northwestern professor, pointed to how the fundamental discovery was made using a grant from the National Institute of Health. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Now more than ever, when the NIH is thinking about cutting and slashing … here’s somebody who took a very basic biochemical approach, and they found the enzyme, and they found what the enzyme does, and they gave that enzyme to people who had genetic mutations. And it made a difference,” said Chandel.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Even as the researchers remain hopeful, they are cautious that this study reflects the story of just one individual with an HPDL deficiency. There is still much to be discovered when it comes to the onset of this rare HPDL deficiency and the crucial window of symptom development of this disorder during infancy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It takes both the discovery, yes, and people who are willing to take the risk,” said Pacold, who along with his team are already working up a larger clinical trial to encompass other HPDL variants, children across a wider age range, and fleshing out the best treatment regimen for 4-HB.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the first month on the treatment, “a very happy child came into the lab and said, ‘When are you going to get this into a pill form, so it’s easier to take?’” said Pacold, “He’d apparently gone for over a 1-kilometer walk in Central Park the day before that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2836262"&gt;new review&lt;/a&gt; of antidepressant withdrawal effects – written by academics, many of whom have close ties to drug manufacturers – risks underestimating the potential harms to long-term antidepressant users by focusing on short-term, industry-funded studies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is growing recognition that stopping antidepressants – especially after long-term use – can cause severe and sometimes &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2045125320967183?rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&amp;amp;url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org"&gt;debilitating&lt;/a&gt; withdrawal symptoms, and it is now acknowledged by the UK government as a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/prescribed-medicines-review-report"&gt;public health issue&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main reasons this issue took decades to recognise after the release of modern antidepressants onto the market is because medical guidelines, such as those produced by Nice (England’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence), had for many years declared withdrawal effects to be &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178125001453?via%3Dihub"&gt;“brief and mild”&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This description was based on studies run by drug companies, where people had only taken the medication for eight to 12 weeks. As a result, when patients later showed up with severe, long-lasting symptoms, many doctors &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395623001309?via%3Dihub"&gt;didn’t take them seriously&lt;/a&gt; because these experiences contradicted what the guidelines led them to expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our recent research helps explain this mismatch. We found a clear link between how long someone takes antidepressants and how likely they are to experience withdrawal symptoms – and how severe these symptoms are. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We surveyed &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178125001453?via%3Dihub"&gt;NHS patients&lt;/a&gt; and found that people who had used antidepressants for more than two years were ten times more likely to have withdrawal effects, five times more likely for those effects to be severe, and 18 times more likely for them to be long lasting compared with those who had taken the drugs for six months or less. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For patients who used antidepressants for less than six months, withdrawal symptoms were mostly mild and brief. Three-quarters reported no or mild symptoms, most of which lasted less than four weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only one in four of these patients was unable to stop when they wanted to. However, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178125001453?via%3Dihub"&gt;for long-term users&lt;/a&gt; (more than two years), two-thirds reported moderate or severe withdrawal effects, with one-quarter reporting severe withdrawal effects. Almost one-third of long-term users reported symptoms that lasted for more than three months. Four-fifths of these patients were unable to stop their antidepressants despite trying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About 2 million people on antidepressants in England have been taking them for over five years, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-65825012"&gt;according to a BBC investigation&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db283.htm"&gt;in the US&lt;/a&gt; at least 25 million people have taken antidepressants for more than five years. What happens to people in eight-to-12-week studies is a far cry from what happens to millions of people when they stop. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studying what happens to people after just eight to 12 weeks on antidepressants is like testing car safety by crashing a vehicle into a wall at 5km/h – ignoring the fact that real drivers are out on the roads doing 60km/h.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;History repeating itself?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, a review has just been published in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2025.1362?utm_campaign=articlePDF%26utm_medium=articlePDFlink%26utm_source=articlePDF%26utm_content=jamapsychiatry.2025.1362"&gt;Jama Psychiatry&lt;/a&gt;. Several of the senior authors declare payments from drug companies. In what looks like history repeating itself, the review draws on short-term trials – many funded by the pharmaceutical industry – that were similar to those used to shape early treatment guidelines. The authors conclude that antidepressants do not cause significant withdrawal effects. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their main analysis is based on eleven trials that compared withdrawal symptoms in people who had stopped antidepressants with those who had continued them or stopped taking a placebo. Six of these trials had people on antidepressants for eight weeks, four for 12 weeks and just one for 26 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They reported a slightly higher number of withdrawal symptoms in people who had stopped antidepressants, which they say does not constitute a “clinically significant” withdrawal syndrome. They also suggest the symptoms could be explained by the “nocebo effect” – where negative expectations cause people to feel worse. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our view, the results are likely to greatly underestimate the risk of withdrawal for the millions of people on these drugs for years. The review found no relationship between the duration of use of antidepressants and withdrawal symptoms, but there were too few long-term studies to test this association properly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review probably underestimates, in our view, short-term withdrawal effects too by assuming that the fact that people experience withdrawal-like symptoms when stopping a placebo or continuing an antidepressant cancels out withdrawal effects from antidepressants. But this is not a valid assumption. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that antidepressant withdrawal effects overlap with side-effects and with everyday symptoms, but this does not mean they are the same thing. People stopping a placebo report symptoms such as dizziness and headache, because these are common occurrences. However, as was shown in another &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(24)00133-0/fulltext"&gt;recent review&lt;/a&gt;, symptoms following discontinuation of a placebo tend to be milder than those experienced when stopping antidepressants, which can be intense enough to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11448088/"&gt;require emergency care&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Some withdrawal effects are severe enough to require emergency care.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;span class="source"&gt;Kay Roxby / Alamy Stock Photo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So deducting the rate of symptoms after stopping a placebo or continuing an antidepressant from antidepressant withdrawal symptoms is likely to underestimate the true extent of withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The review also doesn’t include several well-designed drug company studies that found high rates of withdrawal symptoms. For example, an American &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006-3223(98)00126-7"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found that more than 60% of people who stopped antidepressants (after eleven months) experienced withdrawal symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors suggest that depression after stopping antidepressants is probably a return of the original condition, not withdrawal symptoms, because similar rates of depression were seen in people who stopped taking a placebo. But this conclusion is based on limited and unreliable data (that is, relying on participants in studies to report such events without prompting, rather than assessing them systematically) from just five studies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope uncritical reporting of a review based on the sort of short-term studies that led to under-recognition of withdrawal effects in the first place, does not disrupt the growing acceptance of the problem and slow efforts by the health system to help potentially millions of people who may be severely affected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The authors and publisher of the new review have been approached for comment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

you keep your brain—and other organs—young?  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study suggested that a routine of vigorous exercise, a diet rich in poultry and oily fish, and keeping your intellect sharp with further education can all help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Research has found a simple crossword can help reduce your risk of developing dementia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, smoking, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-37ea9990-5cab-11f0-b618-1bdcb6a54d2b"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, eating processed meat, a lack of sleep, and living in a deprived area accelerated organ aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, these lifestyle changes that keep your organs youthful can also help you live longer, found the research by Stanford Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, you don't need to sign up to further education to keep your brain young—a simple crossword in the morning can do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3885259/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found the five-minute activity slows down memory decline in the early stages of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previously, &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.jamda.com/article/S1525-8610(24)00879-X/abstract"&gt;researchers &lt;/a&gt;found moderate-to-vigorous exercise lowers risk of dementia by 41 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is exercise which gets the heart racing and breathing to the point you can still speak but not sing, like brisk walking, jogging or cycling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-7253703/High-intensity-workouts-better-cardio-staving-dementia.html"&gt;some scientists&lt;/a&gt; suggest high intensity workouts (HITT) could be better than cardio for staving off dementia, because they force more blood to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HITT sees people do short bursts of intense exercise with 80 per cent of their effort, followed by a recovery period to allow their heart rate to drop again. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Often, they involve quick exercises like burpees, mountain climbers, jump squats, kettlebell swings and treadmill sprints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, it is best to avoid high-intensity workouts before bedtime, as &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14883621/How-you-protect-dementia-simple-steps-bombshell-study-stunning-discovery-ROB-GALLOWAY.html"&gt;a study&lt;/a&gt; found it reduces sleep, which can increase your risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other researchers have suggested the ideal age to ramp up exercise to prevent dementia is between the ages of 45 and 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But experts have warned that pushing yourself too far during exercise can trigger life-threatening brain-bleeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last month, a super-fit personal trainer claimed medics blamed her sudden brain bleed on 'years of overdoing it at the gym'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Linzi Todd, from Northampton, suffered a massive brain bleed in March triggered by fluid leaking from her spine, that doctors put down to her history of intense exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous studies have suggested excessive exercise may trigger brain bleeds, leading to potentially fatal strokes or brain haemorrhages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Other research has proposed lifestyle changes that can reduce your risk of dementia—a condition that slowly takes away loved one's memories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;According to scientists cases of the debilitating condition are predicted to rise to 1.4million in the UK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This includes preventing hearing loss, socialising, quitting smoking, and maintaining a healthy weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 944,000 people in the UK are thought to be living with dementia, while the figure is thought to be around seven million in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the UK dementia cases are expected to sky-rocket to 1.4million people by 2040 according to University College London scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recent analysis by the Alzheimer's Society estimated the overall annual cost of the dementia to the UK is £42billion a year, with families bearing the brunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An ageing population means these costs—which include lost earnings of unpaid carers—are set to soar to £90billion in the next 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A separate Alzheimer's Research UK analysis found 74,261 people died from dementia in 2022 compared with 69,178 a year earlier, making it the country's biggest killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Classic early signs of the devastating illness are memory loss, difficulty concentrating, communication difficulties, and changes of mood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However recent studies have found changes in sight, hearing, touch and balance are little-known signs that can strike years before more well-known symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts called for these sensory changes to be included in diagnostic tests to help people be diagnosed sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An early diagnosis for dementia is considered critical as, while the condition is incurable, treatments can combat symptoms and sometimes slow progression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 8-year-old boy declined rapidly over only a few months. In August 2023, he was running and playing soccer, but by September, involuntary muscle contractions took hold of both his ankles. By October, he'd lost the ability to run and play sports, and by late November, he fell down frequently enough that physical therapists advised his family to get him a wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Genetic testing confirmed the cause of the child's sudden deterioration: He carried two mutant copies of a gene called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=HPDL" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=HPDL" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;HPDL&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The HPDL protein helps make an antioxidant, called coenzyme Q10, that is critical to the functioning of mitochondria, the powerhouses of cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HDPL deficiencies are rare and can vary in severity depending on which mutations a person carries. In the boy's case, the telltale symptoms of muscle &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/14346-spasticity" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/14346-spasticity" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;spasticity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and paralysis didn't emerge until after his eighth birthday — but two of his siblings had died in infancy of a more severe form of the condition, marked by brain damage and seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child's parents feared he might meet the same fate, given that there were &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://neurosciences.ucsd.edu/research/labs/gleeson/hpdl/index.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://neurosciences.ucsd.edu/research/labs/gleeson/hpdl/index.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;no available treatments&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They were so scared when we met," said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1861806515/claire-miller" target="_blank" data-url="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1861806515/claire-miller" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Claire Miller&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a pediatric neurologist who specializes in movement disorders at NYU Langone Health. At that time, in November 2023, the child couldn't cross the hospital lobby without falling, and his condition grew noticeably worse from one week to the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with the help of Miller, other NYU specialists and special permission from the Food and Drug Administration, the child started an experimental treatment for his condition that had never been tested in humans before. The treatment includes a molecule that likely works by helping the body bypass the lack of HDPL in order to make CoQ10, the researchers think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/scientists-just-discovered-a-single-molecule-that-may-treat-rare-devastating-mitochondrial-diseases" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/medicine-drugs/scientists-just-discovered-a-single-molecule-that-may-treat-rare-devastating-mitochondrial-diseases"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists just discovered a single molecule that may treat rare, devastating mitochondrial diseases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-tmgBmDefq5bLE8BRnGkEob" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-tmgBmDefq5bLE8BRnGkEob slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within a month, the boy could walk more than half a mile (1 kilometer) through Central Park with his family. Fast-forward to today, and he's joined them on a 4-mile (6 km) hike and also operates the pedals of a go-kart by himself. His strength is returning, along with his energy and stamina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even small improvements — like walking more easily or having more energy — mean a lot," his family, who wish to remain anonymous, told Live Science in an email. "It's reassuring to know the treatment is making a difference."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the plan is to keep the child taking the oral medication daily, and so far, the regimen has not had any concerning side effects. The child's medical team hopes to test the treatment in more patients with these HPDL deficiencies and then in a broader group of patients with related conditions that affect CoQ10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For us, trying an experimental treatment gave our child a chance at a better life," the family told Live Science. "And we're grateful we took that chance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="from-mouse-to-human-3"&gt;From mouse to human&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This first-in-human clinical trial was enabled by promising experiments in lab mice, conducted in the lab of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1841327293/michael-e-pacold" target="_blank" data-url="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1841327293/michael-e-pacold" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Michael Pacold&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor in the Department of Radiation Oncology at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine and the Perlmutter Cancer Center. Some of these mouse experiments were described in a new paper published Wednesday (July 9) in the journal &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_1274875180951996136&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-09246-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fmedicine-drugs%2F8-year-old-with-rare-fatal-disease-shows-dramatic-improvement-on-experimental-treatment" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09246-x" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-025-09246-x&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fmedicine-drugs%2F8-year-old-with-rare-fatal-disease-shows-dramatic-improvement-on-experimental-treatment" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, along with details of the one-patient trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to their latest work, the Pacold lab had &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_8350101677562434502&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-021-03865-w&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fmedicine-drugs%2F8-year-old-with-rare-fatal-disease-shows-dramatic-improvement-on-experimental-treatment" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03865-w" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-021-03865-w&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fmedicine-drugs%2F8-year-old-with-rare-fatal-disease-shows-dramatic-improvement-on-experimental-treatment" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;published a study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; helping to unpack one of the roles of HPDL in mitochondria. They found that protein fulfills the first step in a chain reaction that ends with the creation of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/antioxidants" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/antioxidants"&gt;&lt;u&gt;antioxidant&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; CoQ10. In summary, HPDL turns a compound called 4-HMA into another called 4-HB, which is then used to build the "head" of CoQ10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's thought that CoQ10 helps mitochondria diffuse reactive molecules that would otherwise damage them, and it may also be crucial to the processes by which mitochondria make fuel, Pacold told Live Science. It also performs other functions in the body, particularly in cell membranes, and when people don't make enough, that deficiency can cause widespread issues, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/primary-coenzyme-q10-deficiency/" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/primary-coenzyme-q10-deficiency/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;especially in energy-hungry organs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; like the brain, kidneys and muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pulse.cedars-sinai.org/news/rare-neurologic-disorder-identified" target="_blank" data-url="https://pulse.cedars-sinai.org/news/rare-neurologic-disorder-identified" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;HPDL deficiencies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also fall under the broader umbrella of CoQ10 deficiencies, because the protein helps to make the head of this antioxidant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;Pictured above is the mouse cerebellum, part of the brain critical for balance and muscle control. Mice with a condition similar to that of the child described in the current study, HPDL encephalopathy, have an underdeveloped cerebellum (as seen on the left). The study treatment restored cerebellar size and development (as seen on the right). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shi et al., Nature)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;CoQ10 is available as a supplement, but very little makes it into the brain when patients take it this way. The reason is not fully understood, but it's known that the antioxidant is poorly absorbed in the gut, so little makes it to the bloodstream, and even less makes it across the brain's protective barrier because the molecule is large, Pacold said. It's also hydrophobic, or greasy, which likely impedes its movement through the body, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, scientists have been searching for other ways to boost the antioxidant's levels in the central nervous system and thus treat these patients. The pathway defined by Pacold and colleagues offered a clue as to how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They tested their idea in genetically engineered lab mice that do not make HPDL. At baseline, these mice develop severe seizures and die within 15 days of birth. Treating the mice orally with CoQ10 does not save them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So instead, the team tried giving the mice 4-HMA and 4-HB, so they essentially bypassed the missing domino in the chain. If treated early enough after birth, 90% of the mice given this treatment survived as long as normal lab mice — upward of 18 months — and they showed only limited neurological symptoms, such as paw weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"His data was incredibly convincing to me," Miller said of Pacold's findings. Seeing the benefits of the treatment and the lack of side effects in mice, Miller agreed there was a chance that the same molecule could work in a person with HPDL deficiency — namely, the 8-year-old patient referred to their clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seemed that the risk of trying this, although in a way unquantifiable, was also low," she said. "And the benefit was possibly huge, with the caveat that sometimes animal models don't necessarily translate well into humans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="more-to-learn-3"&gt;More to learn&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the lab mice, the 8-year-old child took a daily treatment orally in a solution dissolved in water. The patient was treated with only 4-HB, in part because the compound was already available in a "highly pure form," the researchers noted in their report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child says the medicine is sour and tastes better cold, Miller noted, but on the whole, it's fairly palatable. Having started the treatment in December 2023, now, "he practically is able to do all daily functional activities by himself except sports," his family told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taken together, the study and trial findings suggest that the treatment can restore function and boost survival in both mice and humans that lack HDPL, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://hekimilab.mcgill.ca/hekimi-lab-mcgill-biography-and-cv-of-dr-siegfried-hekimi.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://hekimilab.mcgill.ca/hekimi-lab-mcgill-biography-and-cv-of-dr-siegfried-hekimi.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Siegfried Hekimi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor in the Department of Biology at McGill University who was not involved in the research, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, based on the available data, Hekimi questions whether the improvements seen in the lab mice and the 8-year-old boy are directly related to restored CoQ10 levels or to some other mechanism. It may be that the increases in 4-HMA and 4-HB have their own effects, independent of CoQ10, that are not yet fully understood and actually explain the medicine's therapeutic effect. At this point, it would be speculative to suggest that this same treatment might treat other types of CoQ10 deficiencies, Hekimi argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors agreed that more research is needed to understand exactly how the experimental treatment works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pacold emphasized that this experimental treatment has so far been tried in only one patient. "The immediate next step is to try to get this into more patients with this disease … and establish whether or not the response that we saw in this child is typical," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, though, Miller sees reason for hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We all know that research does not always turn out as one hopes, and life does not turn out as one hopes," Miller said. But "this is a really happy story. This is a heartwarming story. This is a child who appeared to become very, very sick with symptoms in a very short amount of time, and he's doing so much better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-tmgBmDefq5bLE8BRnGkEob-G6xcB6R34ZqhlIXlpuKTkx2DGlWRCclV" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-tmgBmDefq5bLE8BRnGkEob-G6xcB6R34ZqhlIXlpuKTkx2DGlWRCclV slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

            At 96 years old, Betty Parker is tired of hearing about other people’s aches and pains.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200083b6m44s16akv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead, she fills her journal with all the great things she is still doing: picking roses from her garden, reading, playing cards with her regular group and baking pies when she entertains.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200093b6m476qcxb0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            OK, she admits that maybe she doesn’t quite have the energy to bake pies anymore and should probably buy something from the grocery store next time. Even so, Parker said her 90s have been filled with purpose and connection –– something many people struggle with no matter their age.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000a3b6mf7280xhl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Healthy behaviors like &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/09/health/live-longer-diet-wellness/index.html"&gt;nutritious eating&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/15/health/strength-exercises-resistance-training-wellness"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; are important to living longer, but &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/19/health/loneliness-social-isolation-early-death-risk-wellness"&gt;loneliness and social isolation are also key factors&lt;/a&gt; to address to have more years and enjoy them, said California-based gerontologist Dr. Kerry Burnight, who is also Parker’s daughter.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000b3b6mqexwzfn3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Life expectancy generally has improved in the last generation. But we want to make sure that individuals are living good years, as opposed to just living longer,” said Dr. John Batsis, a geriatrician and an associate professor at UNC’s School of Medicine and Gillings School of Global Public Health in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000c3b6mvygi2603@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A geriatrician is a medical doctor focusing on the care of older adults, while a gerontologist studies aging from the biological perspective as well as the social and psychological, Burnight said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000d3b6mi1fcoxc6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are four factors that Burnight sees as being the most important to getting the most joy out of your longer, healthier years: growing, connecting, adapting and giving. And fortunately, just like you can exercise daily to keep your body healthy, she says you can work out your internal strength to improve your connections and sense of purpose.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000e3b6mwuubajk5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not too early or too late to start creating a life you enjoy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000f3b6m8aztyxto@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you haven’t retired yet, it may be a good idea to start thinking about what your days will look like when you stop working, Batsis said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000g3b6mty1smgc2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The retirement cliff, so to speak, is very difficult for individuals who have been working a lifetime,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000h3b6mc1mawlr7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It can feel like suddenly you lose everything –– a sense of purpose, how you fill your days and who you connect with –– when you are no longer going into work every day, especially if you have not made a plan, he said. Instead of making such a drastic change, Batsis advises people to start taking up hobbies and activities you’d like to do in retirement while you are still working.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000i3b6mu0bgcose@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you have already retired, you can find opportunities to build new things you love, Burnight said. If you have always wanted to publish a book, 80 isn’t too old to start writing. In fact, you may still have a lot of time ahead of you to invest in your passions, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000j3b6msrt48x36@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s not too late at all. In fact, it’s the perfect time to really lean into and redefine it,” said Burnight, author of the upcoming book “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Joyspan-Science-Thriving-Lifes-Second/dp/1546007350" target="_blank"&gt;Joyspan&lt;/a&gt;: The Art and Science of Thriving in Life’s Second Half.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000k3b6m70k3e67t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Daily crossword puzzles or sudoku are a good way to engage your brain, but to stay cognitively sharp and increase the enjoyment of your older years it is important to do difficult things, Burnight said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000l3b6miwyha2br@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “New experiences activate neuro plasticity …  that is our brain’s ability to keep growing,” she said. “If you do the same things you’ve always done, you’re really not setting yourself up for continued growth.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000m3b6mlpcqatgm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of Batsis’ patients took up golf after he retired, but he also started playing a musical instrument guitar. It wasn’t something he had ever done before, and he didn’t consider himself musically inclined, but the activity opened up a whole new world for him, Batsis said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000n3b6mq1oqid9p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, the patient plays the guitar and also attends local concerts that he might not have otherwise, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Batsis recommends trying to find a hobby that will keep you physically active. The less you move, the weaker you get, and so he said that finding something that disrupts a sedentary pattern can be helpful in keeping more activities available to you as you get older.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000p3b6mcm979skv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The key, however, is to find something you enjoy –– not to push yourself to activities you think you are supposed to do in your older age, Batsis said. If you never liked books, you probably won’t be motivated to become a reader in retirement, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000q3b6m730cy2z7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Individuals need to find something that is of interest to them, because the more interesting it is to them, the more they’re going to be willing to kind of engage in that type of activity.” Batsis said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            For caregivers, Burnight cautions against doing for your loved ones anything that they can do for themselves, which varies depending on their skill set or physical limitations. Doing challenging things is important and helpful, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000s3b6mz4be183v@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About once a month, Parker meets with a group she calls “the youngs” to play canasta, which she taught them.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000t3b6m3qjm314g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The youngs” are a group of women in their 60s whom she met through her daughter-in-law. Although they are much younger than her, Parker said she values having a diverse group of friends. That is especially true as she has outlived her husband and other close connections, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000u3b6miz8ty436@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Like how we diversify our financial portfolio, socially we want to have friends of different ages, friends from your neighborhood, as well as friends from the past,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000v3b6mwr7iwaln@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If you need connection with more people from your past, Burnight recommends using social media to reach out to people whom you might have lost touch with over the years. People are usually happy to hear from an old friend, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000w3b6m2kl4or3t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Even small interactions with a neighbor or at your coffee shop can often lead to more meaningful relationships, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000x3b6mth7zgk5h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Her most important piece of advice is to be the friend, Burnight said. Loneliness is dangerous to longevity, so investing in connection is important.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000y3b6mbp79ntop@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You need to be the one to call to make a plan or to remember a birthday, or to sit by somebody’s hospital bed or to drive them to their chemo,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmcuu1otv001c3b6mn14o5iz7@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="finding-joy-and-purpose" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Finding joy and purpose
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o12000z3b6m5n0y91xf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While Parker has a lot of joy in her 90s, it hasn’t come without a need to adapt, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200103b6mi1aeolw1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She had to give up tennis years ago, which she misses, and now she has to use a walker to get around sometimes, she said. But those changes haven’t prevented her from laughing with her family, spending time in her yard or even being in a local parade for the Fourth of July holiday, Parker said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200113b6m2xb4w7pq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We are always going to have changing circumstances, and growing older brings a lot of challenge,” Burnight said. “Instead of just denying that or saying, ‘Oh, my life can’t be great now that I’ve had these things,’ the ones who age well are the ones that adapt, meaning they’re able to accept and even embrace change.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200123b6mc8eg6eeu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The way that you adapt largely is recognizing that it isn’t wrong that you’re going to have tough stuff. It’s how you’re going to respond to that tough stuff,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200133b6mxpmz0h0i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34498894/" target="_blank"&gt;Research has suggested&lt;/a&gt; that how you think about aging profoundly impacts how you actually age, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200143b6mnjpz36gx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “People who believe that aging is a time of continued growth &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12150226/" target="_blank"&gt;live 7.5 years longer&lt;/a&gt; than those who think, ‘Oh, I’m old. I’m going to retire and just go knit with the ladies,’” Burnight said. Unless, of course, you enjoy knitting or want to pick it up as a new hobby.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200153b6mxxeff3qn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead, she recommends turning your attention to all you have to give. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37037156/" target="_blank"&gt;Evidence also suggests&lt;/a&gt; that people who give report higher levels of joy, purpose and longevity, Burnight said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200163b6m3dr4epo6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sounds like a lot to do all at once? Don’t worry. You can start small.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200173b6mv8smocz4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Maybe it is delivering a lemon from your tree to a friend or offering to watch your neighbors’ young children while they run errands, she said. Even creating art, planting a garden or giving someone who is sick a call is an act of giving that can give you purpose, Burnight said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuu1o1200183b6m7ib6ofup@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Purpose is small and daily and a decision,” she said. “It’s saying, ‘Okay, today, how am I going to use the fact that I’m alive and that I have things to give?’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="trinityAudioPlaceholder trinity-player-iframe-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Upstate resident has the measles, the South Carolina Department of Public Health confirmed Wednesday. It is the first case of the disease in the state since September 2024, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The affected resident is not vaccinated and caught the virus during an international trip, according to a press release. They are currently in isolation at their home and were not contagious while traveling, the release said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have begun a contact investigation notifying people who could have been exposed. Contacts have voluntarily quarantined” to prevent an outbreak, Dr. Brannon Traxler, DPH chief medical officer, said at a Wednesday press conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-101" class="zone zone-el" index="2" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Before [the September 2024 case], there were six cases in the fall of 2018,” Traxler said. “Prior to that, the last reported case in South Carolina was in 1997.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1957, before vaccines against measles were widely available, the state had almost 6,000 cases. There have been three deaths from measles in the United States in 2025 so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traxler declined to identify the city or county where the infected individual resides, citing privacy concerns. She said she believes any further spread of the disease can be prevented due to self-quarantines, and no other cases have been confirmed at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles is highly contagious, and a serious disease caused by a virus that affects the respiratory tract. This virus spreads quickly, which is why we must act now to prevent its spread,” Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist and Health Programs Branch director, is quoted in the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is crucial that health care providers and the public be aware of the symptoms associated with this disease,” Dr. Bell added. “It is proven that the best way to prevent measles is by vaccination. I strongly encourage everyone to review their immunization records to make sure they are up to date on all vaccinations and to talk with their health care provider about the benefits and risks of getting vaccinated.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Public health concern&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pamela Bailey, an infectious disease specialist with Prisma Health, told a Wednesday press conference that many in the public health field feel the return of measles is especially concerning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;”&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-c7f2d2d0-7fff-6616-a466-b2d910e2bc54"&gt;Many epidemiologists consider measles the most infectious disease known to mankind,” Bailey said. One infected person can spread the disease to up to 18 others, a much higher rate of spread than with the flu or COVID-19, Bailey said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“A m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-c8b25398-7fff-bd23-6c91-ddf061073121"&gt;easles infection can wipe out a patient’s immune memory for everything except measles,” she said, explaining this would leave someone more susceptible to “flus, common colds, diarrheal diseases. Your body just forgets everything else.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-106" class="zone zone-el" index="11" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;1,267 cases of measles had been confirmed in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; as of July 1, 2025, including cases in Palmetto State neighbors Georgia and North Carolina along with 35 other states. The CDC has confirmed three measles deaths so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There have been 27 outbreaks [defined by the CDC as a group of three or more related cases] reported in 2025, and 88% of confirmed cases (1,115 of 1,267) are outbreak-associated. For comparison, 16 outbreaks were reported during 2024 and 69% of cases (198 of 285) were outbreak-associated,” the CDC reports on its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting in January, &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;Texas saw a measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; with a total of 753 confirmed cases, primarily in the west of the state, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. 98 of those infected were hospitalized.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a July 8 update, officials said that less than 10 of the confirmed cases are expected to be actively infectious. Over the course of the outbreak, two school-aged children died. Both were not vaccinated, and neither had underlying conditions. Throughout the recent Texas outbreak, the majority of measles cases were in children 17 and younger, according to the July 8 update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-107" class="zone zone-el" index="14" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s part of a national trend, as &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/09/well/us-measles-record-outbreaks.html" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;the number of measles cases has hit a record high this century&lt;/a&gt;, the New York Times reported on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Concern for children&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;”&lt;span id="docs-internal-guid-19c09b69-7fff-d3fd-6909-ba45922c68e8"&gt;One concerning thing to people in public health is watching the number of children entering school who are not vaccinated for measles in South Carolina,” Bailey said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“We have dropped below the 95% threshold [needed for herd immunity against spread of the disease] in South Carolina,” she added. “&lt;/span&gt;We are ripe for outbreaks. And there are pockets of communities that, for cultural reasons, have chosen not to vaccinate, and those can lead to big outbreaks” like the one in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-108" class="zone zone-el" index="18" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles can manifest in a rash lasting five to six days, Traxler said, and can escalate to pneumonia and swelling of the brain. One in five cases may require hospitalization, and one in a thousand infected will die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disease is spread through the air and the virus can remain infectious for up to six hours after the infected person has left the area, Traxler added. Anyone with measles should isolate for at least four days after the rash first appears. Adults with healthy immune systems can receive an MMR vaccine even if they may have previously gotten one of the multi-stage shots or contracted measles, although a completed dose of MMR or a prior history should give lifelong immunity. The vaccine is available at most pharmacies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a developing story.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="summary gray"&gt;This story was originally published &lt;span class="inline-block"&gt;July 9, 2025 at 10:31 AM.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="zone grid"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="story-module"&gt;&lt;div class="author-card "&gt;

At least 12 states are dealing with active outbreaks, which the CDC defines as three or more cases. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is up to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;1,288 confirmed measles cases this year,&lt;/a&gt; the CDC said July 8, the latest information available. The CDC confirmed three deaths from the virus so far this year, said Traxler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Measles is highly contagious, and a serious disease caused by a virus that affects the respiratory tract. This virus spreads quickly, which is why we must act now to prevent its spread," Dr. Linda Bell, state epidemiologist, said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Measles is among the most contagious viruses that scientists study, where each confirmed case can be expected to infect up to 18 additional people. It is a respiratory virus, spread by droplets, and is essentially airborne, experts said. It can persist in a room up to two hours after an infected person has left it, which helps explain why it spreads so easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also points to why it spreads so easily through travel, and many new cases are related to cases or outbreaks from other areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only proven protection is through vaccination, and South Carolina's relatively low rate had health experts worried the virus would eventually show up. The &lt;a href="https://dph.sc.gov/public/vaccinations/sc-immunization-data" target="_blank"&gt;state's vaccination rate&lt;/a&gt; varies from 87 percent to 92 percent from region to region — well below the ideal rate of 95 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    

    
    
    
    
&lt;p&gt;While two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine are required to attend school in the Palmetto State, more and more parents are opting out. That rate is now 2.4 percent, or 20,000 kids statewide in the 2023-24 school year, but is much higher in some districts. There were more than 3,200 kids, or nearly 6 percent, in Spartanburg County who got exempted from vaccines and more 4,000 children, or 4.3 percent, in Greenville County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cycling during middle age may be one of the best ways to protect brain health later in life, according to a new &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2835115" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in JAMA Network Open.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bikeradar.com/news/cycling-in-midlife-tied-to-lower-dementia-risk" target="_blank"&gt;BikeRadar&lt;/a&gt; reported that researchers from China and Australia analyzed long-term data from nearly half a million people to investigate how different modes of everyday travel, such as driving, walking, and &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-home/adventure-cycling-association-reasons-bicycle-travel-benefits/" target="_blank"&gt;cycling&lt;/a&gt;, impacted the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their findings suggested that cycling, even casually, may significantly reduce the risk of multiple types of dementia, including Alzheimer's. The study called it "a promising approach for maintaining brain health." &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The data came from UK Biobank and tracked participants over 13 years. During that time, over 8,800 cases of dementia were recorded, but those who biked regularly had lower rates. Researchers also found that this group had larger hippocampal volumes. The hippocampus is a key part of the brain associated with memory and learning, with greater sizes linked to better long-term cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-021664410452f466440380e19c57f7ea theco-cala-woah-widget" id="theco-021664410452f466440380e19c57f7ea"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-a6f1a27350055cb1ad7aec8345f50df6 theco-biolite-woah-widget" id="theco-a6f1a27350055cb1ad7aec8345f50df6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-6223ddd3c5821e22bb8594f2ff45eeff theco-saveon-energy-widget-programmatic" id="theco-6223ddd3c5821e22bb8594f2ff45eeff"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-ddd3b76742bf5e4423592c9d517a45e1 theco-rewiring-america-widget-woah" id="theco-ddd3b76742bf5e4423592c9d517a45e1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-e855e1fc230dc4d93f461c715c6b4ef3 theco-recurrent-woah-widget" id="theco-e855e1fc230dc4d93f461c715c6b4ef3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-e5a23188f177773e0906a0d642cac032 theco-programmatic-ev-ira-widget" id="theco-e5a23188f177773e0906a0d642cac032"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-aafd0d78aed3eab12fce0c00807c470f theco-palmetto-woah-widget" id="theco-aafd0d78aed3eab12fce0c00807c470f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-0d6910dfe83204db8cd50fc2d8dc73ee theco-greenportfolio-woah" id="theco-0d6910dfe83204db8cd50fc2d8dc73ee"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-7205012d6f57d284472dfa03f7659ea0 theco-energysage-widget-woah" id="theco-7205012d6f57d284472dfa03f7659ea0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-6323cb2c7a9312197b5a20630fc40ee6 theco-energysage-heat-pump-programmatic" id="theco-6323cb2c7a9312197b5a20630fc40ee6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-b9081fc21a50bd2aa19fdc6c181c7718 theco-trashie-widget-woah" id="theco-b9081fc21a50bd2aa19fdc6c181c7718"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cycling, especially as a regular form of transport, may help "increase blood flow to the brain, reduce inflammation, and stimulate neurogenesis," said study co-author Liangkai Chen. These factors may explain the clear differences in brain health between active and inactive travelers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-848e040ec74577068ca8daf9a80449d9 theco-nolan-interior-permalink" id="theco-848e040ec74577068ca8daf9a80449d9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Encouragingly, even people with a genetic predisposition to dementia, such as those with the APOE4 gene, appeared to benefit from cycling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-ae4513ec38698f71bedcfb5ff50a42f8 theco-inline-advertorial" id="theco-ae4513ec38698f71bedcfb5ff50a42f8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;








&lt;p&gt;The study supported earlier findings, which &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/can-a-weekend-warrior-exercise-regimen-protect-your-brain" target="_blank"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; that even people who exercise only once or twice a week were up to 25% less likely to develop dementia than those who didn't exercise at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The benefits of cycling extend beyond the brain. Swapping driving for biking can help reduce pollution from nonrenewable energy sources such as gasoline, which is linked to cognitive decline, heart disease, and warming climates. Studies have shown that air pollution &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/outdoors/dementia-alzheimers-air-pollution-fine-particulate-matter/" target="_blank"&gt;increases the risk&lt;/a&gt; of dementia, with areas of improved air quality and &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/green-tech/improved-cognitive-function-greenery-benefits-socioeconomic-status/" target="_blank"&gt;greener spaces&lt;/a&gt; positively impacting brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-7b0f79d32f4eaff513679dc903f46d9c theco-recurrent-2-woah-widget" id="theco-7b0f79d32f4eaff513679dc903f46d9c"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-e1718dcb97e7d819cb959dbe201347b3 theco-palmetto-2-solar-widget" id="theco-e1718dcb97e7d819cb959dbe201347b3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-bf614685575e7321e239fe666983444e theco-ad-before-10th-paragraph" id="theco-bf614685575e7321e239fe666983444e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-5b7e978fe43306ae2f6a295a5cbb9c44 theco-energysage-solar-2-widget" id="theco-5b7e978fe43306ae2f6a295a5cbb9c44"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-25fdb862fb411e1e8a06843ad9b39685 theco-opportunities-programmatic-widget" id="theco-25fdb862fb411e1e8a06843ad9b39685"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="theco-a2bb5b06504f145fbdf01f9642399165 theco-cala-widget-programmatic" id="theco-a2bb5b06504f145fbdf01f9642399165"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle changes, such as cycling, can benefit both personal and environmental health. Engaging in conversations about &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/talk-climate-with-your-family-and-friends/" target="_blank"&gt;climate&lt;/a&gt; health effects with friends or inviting them to &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/actions/walk-places-when-you-can/" target="_blank"&gt;walk&lt;/a&gt; with you can also help improve your health and the planet's.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In other words, even more reasons to get moving. Readers online agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

You can often dismiss it as nothing more than &lt;a href="/topic/heartburn"&gt;heartburn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while it is usually a harmless reaction linked to &lt;a href="/topic/digestion"&gt;digestion&lt;/a&gt;, it can sometimes point to underlying health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of these is Barrett’s oesophagus, a condition where some of the &lt;a href="/topic/cells"&gt;cells&lt;/a&gt; in your oesophagus grow abnormally, which increases your risk of oesophageal &lt;a href="/topic/cancer"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, according to the &lt;a href="/topic/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting next year, about 1,500 people in &lt;a href="/topic/london"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="/topic/east-midlands"&gt;East Midlands&lt;/a&gt; will be offered new “heartburn health checks” to screen for Barrett’s oesophagus. The test involves swallowing a capsule on a string, which dissolves in the stomach to release a small sponge. After a few minutes, &lt;a href="/topic/nhs"&gt;NHS&lt;/a&gt; staff retrieve the sponge, which collects cells from the oesophagus for lab analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Peter Johnson, NHS national cancer director, said: “For the majority of people with persistent reflux, these quick and easy heartburn health checks will provide peace of mind that you aren’t at increased risk of cancer, and for those who do find out they have Barrett’s oesophagus, regular follow-up checks will be put in place so any further cell changes can be spotted early.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what exactly is heartburn? And what are some key warning signs to watch for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is heartburn?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wypyku-0 sc-1qbn810-0 lnUWhb eNfKwA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Heartburn, also known as reflux, is characterised by a burning discomfort or pain behind the breastbone, which can sometimes extend into the &lt;a href="/topic/throat"&gt;throat&lt;/a&gt;,” explains Dr Matthew Long, consultant gastroenterologist at The Lister Hospital, part of HCA Healthcare UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It usually occurs after eating or when lying down and is caused by stomach acid irritating the lining of the oesophagus. Additional &lt;a href="/topic/symptoms"&gt;symptoms&lt;/a&gt; may include a sour taste in the mouth, hoarseness, or a chronic cough.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What typically causes heartburn?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The most &lt;a href="/topic/common"&gt;common&lt;/a&gt; cause of heartburn is &lt;a href="/topic/acid-reflux"&gt;acid reflux&lt;/a&gt;, which occurs when the lower oesophageal sphincter – the ring of muscle at the bottom of the oesophagus – weakens or relaxes inappropriately,” explains Long. “Heartburn may also be associated with a hiatus hernia, where part of the stomach pushes through the diaphragm opening that the oesophagus passes through. This condition allows stomach acid to travel upwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Common triggers include large or fatty &lt;a href="/topic/meals"&gt;meals&lt;/a&gt;, alcohol, caffeine, smoking, and being overweight. &lt;a href="/topic/stress"&gt;Stress&lt;/a&gt; and certain medications can also contribute.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How is mild or occasional heartburn managed and treated?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Mild or occasional heartburn can often be managed with simple lifestyle changes, such as eating smaller meals, avoiding late-night eating, reducing alcohol and spicy or fatty food intake, and losing weight if necessary,” says Long. “Over-the-counter treatments like antacids, alginates, or proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as omeprazole can also be effective. If symptoms persist, seeking medical &lt;a href="/topic/advice"&gt;advice&lt;/a&gt; is recommended.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 yqrkU"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/07/17/istock-177268707.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/07/17/istock-177268707.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/09/07/17/istock-177268707.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Heartburn is caused by stomach acid irritating the lining of the oesophagus" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-32507"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Heartburn is caused by stomach acid irritating the lining of the oesophagus&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (istock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do people get confused between heartburn and chest pain symptoms related to heart attacks?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yes, the symptoms can overlap, as both can cause burning or pressure in the chest,” confirms Long. “However, cardiac chest pain often feels heavier, may spread to the arms or jaw, and is more likely to occur during exertion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If there is any doubt, particularly in someone at risk of heart disease, it is important to treat it as a possible heart attack and call 999. Delays in seeking help can be life-threatening.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Can frequent or severe heartburn be a sign of a more serious condition?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Persistent heartburn, especially if it occurs on most days for three weeks or more, can sometimes signal a more serious issue,” says Long. “One concern is Barrett’s oesophagus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As this condition can increase the risk of oesophageal cancer, it is important not to ignore ongoing symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 bJMzeH"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2024/12/05/18/fafgewGettyImages-2164514723-copy.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2024/12/05/18/fafgewGettyImages-2164514723-copy.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2024/12/05/18/fafgewGettyImages-2164514723-copy.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Frequent heartburn could be a sign of a more serious condition" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-32508"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Frequent heartburn could be a sign of a more serious condition&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What accompanying symptoms could indicate that it might be more serious?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Red flag symptoms include difficulty swallowing, food sticking in the throat or chest, unexplained weight loss, persistent vomiting, and iron deficiency anaemia,” highlights Long. “If any of these symptoms are present, it is important to see a &lt;a href="/topic/gp"&gt;GP&lt;/a&gt; urgently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When should you seek medical advice about your heartburn?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You should speak to your GP if you have heartburn most days for more than three weeks,” advises Long. “Seek urgent medical attention if you develop chest pain that could be cardiac in nature, especially if it is sudden, severe, or accompanied by sweating, breathlessness, or pain in the arm or jaw.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Cameron Braddy-Green, consultant gastroenterologist and general physician at Nuffield Health St. Bartholomew’s Hospital agrees and adds: “You should also consult a healthcare professional rather than rely on home remedies if you are aged 55+ with new heartburn symptoms and/or your heartburn does not improve with proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatments such as omeprazole, lansoprazole or pantoprazole.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Jul 2025 13:32:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxNdjBObDFXNHc4czJzb0cwQWdLc0x0M0Y1bUhVckNlN2liTmg2bFRRcWJMY0VFMzY4UV9ra3dRUUhZa2NSaDltaFBTR2hqblEzV1M2M1NYMXI2STBuX0g0ZmRNTjNvZjlWOGREUnRLeWJVOXZBMkxxYmNlRFhnZnVFVGM2MmdGZktqeG1RemRpZk1hbmhqRFRYZWpvanZJUUxhZ1B0Tmc2RGJnWVVkYUFGdEpuRVNnNlk</guid></item><item><title>斯坦福医学院的科学家发现， “年轻大脑”的人比“老脑”的同龄人更长寿-斯坦福医学院 | People with ‘young brains’ outlive ‘old-brained’ peers, Stanford Medicine scientists find - Stanford Medicine</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTE85MDhMeUhpTjFYX05TSGJnSkU5cEhvZEZOcjN6bjhFTWRCMXhaak9nRk5kTVpoV094SkxNZEpYNFY4X2ZVY3lqS1p1a2NxQ3FGeWg2bHhBYjJZU1lSWXFEWkJkTDBfNzZOQW5XQXRyWUhBY2VSb1E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Based on the differences between individuals’ and age-adjusted average organ-assigned protein levels, the algorithm assigned a biological age to each of the 11 distinct organs or organ systems assessed for each subject. And it measured how far each organ’s multiprotein signature in any given individual deviated in either direction from the average for people of the same chronological age. These protein signatures served as proxies for individual organs’ relative biological condition. A greater than 1.5 standard deviation from the average put a person’s organ in the “extremely aged” or “extremely youthful” category.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;One-third of the individuals in the study had at least one organ with a 1.5-or-greater standard deviation from the average, with the investigators designating any such organ as “extremely aged” or “extremely youthful.” One in four participants had multiple extremely aged or youthful organs.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;For the brain, “extremely aged” translated to being among the 6% to 7% of study participants’ brains whose protein signatures fell at one end of the biological-age distribution. “Extremely youthful” brains fell into the 6% to 7% at the opposite end.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;h3&gt;Health outcomes foretold&lt;/h3&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;The algorithm also predicted people’s future health, organ by organ, based on their current organs’ biological age. Wyss-Coray and his colleagues checked for associations between extremely aged organs and any of 15 different disorders including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, chronic liver or kidney disease, Type 2 diabetes, two different heart conditions and two different lung diseases, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Risks for several of those diseases were affected by numerous different organs’ biological age. But the strongest associations were between an individual’s biologically aged organ and the chance that this individual would develop a disease associated with that organ. For example, having an extremely aged heart predicted higher risk of atrial fibrillation or heart failure, having aged lungs predicted heightened chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) risk, and having an old brain predicted higher risk for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;The association between having an extremely aged brain and developing Alzheimer’s disease was particularly powerful — 3.1 times that of a person with a normally aging brain. Meanwhile having an extremely youthful brain was especially protective against Alzheimer’s — barely one-fourth that of a person with a normally aged brain.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;In other words, someone with a biologically old brain is approximately 12 times as likely to receive a new diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease over the next decade or so as someone the same age with a biologically young brain.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;In addition, Wyss-Coray said, brain age was the best single predictor of overall mortality. Having an extremely aged brain increased subjects’ risk of dying by 182% over a roughly 15-year period, while individuals with extremely youthful brains had an overall 40% reduction in their risk of dying over the same duration.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;h3&gt;Predicting the disease, then preventing it&lt;/h3&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;“This approach could lead to human experiments testing new longevity interventions for their effects on the biological ages of individual organs in individual people,” Wyss-Coray said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Medical researchers may, for example, be able to use extreme brain age as a proxy for impending Alzheimer’s disease and intervene before the onset of outward symptoms, when there’s still time to arrest it, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Careful collection of lifestyle, diet and prescribed- or supplemental-substance intake in clinical trials, combined with organ-age assessments, could throw light on the medical value of those factors’ contributions to the aging of various organs, as well as on whether existing, approved drugs can restore organ youth before people develop a disease for which an organ’s advanced biological age puts them at high risk, Wyss-Coray added.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;“This is, ideally, the future of medicine,” he said. “Today, you go to the doctor because something aches, and they take a look to see what’s broken. We’re trying to shift from sick care to health care and intervene before people get organ-specific disease.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;Although the analytical tool is available only for research purposes now, Wyss-Coray has plans to commercialize it. He is a co-founder and scientific officer of Teal Omics and Vero Bioscience, two companies to whom Stanford University’s Office of Technology Licensing has licensed technology developed in this and related research for commercializing, respectively, screens for new drug targets and a consumer product.&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;The test could be available in the next two to three years, Wyss-Coray said. “The cost will come down as we focus on fewer key organs, such as the brain, heart and immune system, to get more resolution and stronger links to specific diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;
        
        &lt;p&gt;The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health (grants P50AG047366 and P30AG066515), the Milky Way Foundation, the Knight Initiative for Brain Resilience and the &lt;a href="https://med.stanford.edu/adrc.html"&gt;Stanford Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Using precise eye-tracking methods, researchers found that mindfulness enhanced reaction speed, focus, and resistance to distractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cognitive benefits were seen in young, middle-aged, and older adults alike, highlighting mindfulness as a valuable tool for maintaining brain health at any stage of life. The findings suggest even short-term meditation can measurably sharpen how the brain handles attention and focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharper Focus:&lt;/strong&gt; Mindfulness improved speed, goal-directed focus, and reduced distractibility.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age-Independent Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Young, middle-aged, and older adults all showed similar gains.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective Proof:&lt;/strong&gt; Eye-tracking revealed changes not reflected in self-reported questionnaires.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;USC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study from the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology reveals that just 30 days of guided mindfulness meditation can significantly enhance key aspects of attentional control — especially how quickly and accurately people direct their focus — regardless of age.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is among the first to use eye tracking, a powerful and objective measure of attention, to test the effects of mindfulness training on young, middle-aged, and older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings demonstrate that even short-term meditation can lead to measurable cognitive improvements, said USC Leonard Davis School postdoctoral researcher Andy Jeesu Kim, the study’s first author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study shows that mindfulness isn’t just about feeling more relaxed—it can literally change the way your brain handles attention,” Kim said. “And that’s incredibly important for maintaining cognitive health as we age.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Attention Matters in Aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As people age, they often experience slower reaction times and increased difficulty tuning out distractions. These changes are tied to a brain system called the locus coeruleus–noradrenaline (LC-NA) system, which plays a critical role in attention, arousal, and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior research, including work led by USC Leonard Davis Professor and study senior author Mara Mather, links age-related decline in this system to early Alzheimer’s disease changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous investigation has also shown that mindfulness meditation can enhance brain areas involved in attention and may increase activity in the LC-NA system. However, this is the first study to examine how mindfulness training affects attention using precise eye-tracking methods and whether the benefits differ across age groups, Kim explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Study: Mindfulness vs. Audiobook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The USC study enrolled 69 adults split into three age groups: young (18–30), middle-aged (50–65), and older adults (65–80). Participants were randomly assigned to practice one of two options:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mindfulness meditation&lt;/strong&gt; using the Headspace app, 10–15 minutes per day for 30 days&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An audiobook control&lt;/strong&gt;, listening to chapters from a novel for the same duration&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All participants completed three in-person lab visits and performed two eye-tracking visual search tasks that measured their speed and accuracy in focusing attention and ignoring distractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Findings: Faster Focus, Stronger Control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the mindfulness training, participants showed improvements in several core aspects of attention:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster reaction times&lt;/strong&gt;: Participants were quicker to move their eyes toward target shapes, showing more efficient visual processing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved goal-directed focus&lt;/strong&gt;: They made more direct saccades (eye movements) toward relevant targets and were better able to resist being pulled off course by distracting objects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced distractibility&lt;/strong&gt;: In some tasks, participants were less likely to fixate on irrelevant but visually “loud” items.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the benefits were not limited to one age group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We expected older adults to benefit the most, but we found that mindfulness improved attention similarly across young, middle-aged, and older adults,” Kim said. “This suggests mindfulness can be a useful tool at any stage of life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these improvements were not reflected in self-reported mindfulness scores from questionnaires, underscoring the value of objective eye-tracking measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Powerful Tool for Everyday Attention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although mindfulness has been widely embraced for stress relief and emotional wellness, this study provides compelling evidence for its cognitive benefits, too. The improvement was particularly apparent in attention control, a mental ability that is crucial for everything from driving to reading to social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the study also compared the effects of the mindfulness intervention to an audiobook control. While both groups showed some improvement in attention, mindfulness participants improved more quickly and more significantly in certain areas, particularly reaction speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s Next&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers note that while the study demonstrates promising short-term benefits, future studies should explore whether longer or more intensive mindfulness training could produce even greater effects, especially for older adults facing age-related cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re excited about the potential of digital mindfulness interventions to help people support their brain health,” Kim said. “It’s simple, low-cost, and widely accessible.

			&lt;p&gt;What's good for your aging gut may also be good for your aging brain. The first study of its kind in twins found that taking daily protein and prebiotic supplements can improve scores on memory tests in people over the age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published early last year, the findings are food for thought, especially as the same visual memory and learning test is used to detect early signs of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="167265" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The double-blinded trial involved two cheap plant fiber prebiotics that are available over the counter in numerous nations around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch the video below for a summary on the research:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prebiotics are non-digestible consumables that help stimulate our gut microbes. One of the supplements was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inulin"&gt;inulin&lt;/a&gt;; a dietary fiber in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructan"&gt;fructan&lt;/a&gt; class. The other, a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructooligosaccharide"&gt;fructooligosaccharide&lt;/a&gt; (FOS), is a plant carbohydrate often used as a natural low calorie sweetener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the effect of these supplements on the aging brain, researchers at King's College London enrolled 36 pairs of twins over the age of 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each duo was randomly split so that one twin was assigned a daily prebiotic in a protein powder and the other was assigned a daily  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="167265" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; in a protein powder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The twin who unknowingly took inulin or FOS generally scored higher on a cognitive test three months later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/can-this-blue-chemical-really-boost-your-brain-heres-what-we-know?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Can This Blue Chemical Really Boost Your Brain? Here's What We Know.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's more, the daily fiber supplements were linked to slight changes in the gut microbiome between twins. The beneficial &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/microbiology/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00925/full"&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, were more plentiful in twins taking inulin or FOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies on mice suggest &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jafc.3c00652"&gt;reduces cognitive deficits&lt;/a&gt; by regulating gut-brain connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are excited to see these changes in just 12 weeks.

ROACH WRITES: I recently had the occasion outside the hospital to recognize an ongoing stroke in a person who did not immediately recognize the importance of his symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-1" data-gaid="inarticle-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="GB7MHNOQU5HANOJTYDINAJLYL4"&gt;Fortunately he did get to the hospital right away, and they treated him rapidly and correctly; his brain function is very good. Had he gone home and taken a nap, which he was considering, it is likely that he would have suffered significant neurological damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="I2BYAKAT2BA4DDF42OOJVZ3QYM"&gt;Any dramatic change in a person’s neurological function should prompt the consideration of a stroke. One tool to help people remember the warning signs of a stroke is FAST: face drooping, arm weakness, or speech difficulty. The T is for time; every minute counts, so get the person to definitive care at a hospital as soon as possible. (Doctor’s offices don’t have the tools for diagnosis and treatment. Call 911.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JB2R7MAYNJA7NFG6JU3AN4BCN4"&gt;However, the FAST memory aid doesn’t include some other warning signs such as loss of balance, vision changes, leg weakness, or numbness of the face, arm or leg. Severe headaches out of nowhere (in a person who has never had them before) may also be a warning sign of a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRD2XWRPBJF4FENGUT6NZL3YGY"&gt;Many people with these symptoms will not be having a stroke, but any of these symptoms could be signs of a stroke, especially if they come on suddenly (hence the name “stroke”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="FRJI3BUMM5EXNB2XTTLEAU57NY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI" data-fusion-component="CKO4P4ZQQVGLJG2F6XF7ROMKAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="KVF24K3KTZDAFKOSBLDSBTYRO4"&gt;DEAR DR. ROACH: My age is 73, and I’ve had a steadily increasing PSA level for many years. In 2020, the result was 11.8 ng/mL, and it has risen to 17-18 ng/mL, where it has stayed for the past year. Since July 2024, I have been taking 10 mg of alfuzosin daily. I had a biopsy in 2017 with no sign of cancer. I had MRIs with/without contrast in 2021 and December 2024; these showed no sign of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="NNY33O36KNDYLKOY432FEVQPKI"&gt;After the last MRI, my urologist wrote: “Your recent MRI showed no suspicious lesions. Only evidence of benign prostate changes is noted. Your prostate volume was 49cc, which gives a predicted PSA level of approximately 6 ng/mL. Your PSA is much higher than this, and the reason is unclear. You should continue to follow your PSA level. At this point, I would not recommend a biopsy of your prostate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="5AY2LGUOPBDKBOCBWSWW324PSI"&gt;He then retired with no further comment. I have an appointment with another urologist but have little idea as to what is happening. -- W.D.W.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QWL26MJYXJDRNISSXTMJZXSR6Y"&gt;ANSWER: It is completely understandable to be concerned about a PSA level of 18 ng/mL, but you and your urologist have, in my opinion, done everything appropriate to look for cancer, which hasn’t been found. It is likely that you do not have prostate cancer as the MRI and biopsy results are reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JQA3ML2S3NAOXIETOZTJA2KIYQ"&gt;I do see this in my own patients from time to time; in these cases, men have continued to have a high PSA level, but I have not seen advanced cancer diagnosed, which is something you are probably worried about. I agree with your (now retired) urologist that additional biopsies are unlikely to be helpful given your normal MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6RTWQKAMCZBHXDEUZ3WRW4RMQU"&gt;You might consider a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor to reduce your prostate cancer risk. These give a 60% expected reduction in prostate cancer risk. Most men do not have side effects, but some men do, so I’d suggest discussing this with the new urologist.

    &lt;p&gt;We’re constantly told to “eat healthy” – but what does that actually mean? Even doctors sometimes struggle to offer clear, practical advice on which specific foods support health, why they work and what real benefits people can expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A growing body of research is starting to offer some answers. Along with colleagues, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40126033/"&gt;I have researched&lt;/a&gt; whether a group of plant compounds called flavan-3-ols could help lower blood pressure and improve blood vessel function. &lt;a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/news/new-study-finds-tea-and-chocolate-may-help-lower-blood-pressure"&gt;The results suggest&lt;/a&gt; these everyday compounds may have real potential for protecting heart health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flavan-3-ols – sometimes called flavanols or catechins – are natural plant compounds that belong to the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5465813/"&gt;flavonoid family&lt;/a&gt;. They’re part of what gives plants their colour and helps protect them from sunlight and pests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For us, they show up in some of our most familiar foods: cocoa, green and black tea, grapes, apples and even some berries. That slightly tart or bitter note you taste in dark chocolate or strong tea? That’s flavan-3-ols at work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long been interested in their health effects. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35294962/"&gt;In 2022, the Cosmos trial&lt;/a&gt; (Cocoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study), which followed over 21,000 people, found that cocoa flavanols, but not multivitamin supplements, reduced deaths from cardiovascular disease by 27%. Our study set out to dig even deeper, focusing specifically on their effects on blood pressure and endothelial function (how well blood vessels dilate and respond to blood flow).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-left "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We analysed data from 145 randomised controlled trials involving more than 5,200 participants. These studies tested a range of flavan-3-ol-rich foods and supplements, including cocoa, tea, grapes, apples and isolated compounds like epicatechin, and measured their effects on two key cardiovascular markers: blood pressure and flow-mediated dilation (FMD): a measure of how well the inner lining of blood vessels functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The studies ranged from short-term (a single dose) to longer-term interventions lasting weeks or months. On average, participants consumed about 586 mg of flavan-3-ols daily; roughly the amount found in two to three cups of tea, one to two servings of dark chocolate, two tablespoons of cocoa powder, or a couple of apples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regular consumption of flavan-3-ols led to an average drop in office blood pressure of 2.8 mmHg systolic (the top number) and 2.0 mmHg diastolic (the bottom number).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for people who started with elevated blood pressure or diagnosed hypertension, the benefits were even greater with reductions of up to 6–7 mmHg systolic and 4 mmHg diastolic. That’s comparable to the effects of some prescription blood pressure medications and could significantly lower the risk of heart attacks &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/eight-ways-to-reduce-your-stroke-risk-no-matter-what-age-you-are-251524"&gt;and strokes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also found that flavan-3-ols improved endothelial function, with an average 1.7% increase in FMD after sustained intake. This benefit appeared even in participants whose blood pressure was already normal, suggesting these compounds may help protect blood vessels through multiple pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side effects were uncommon and typically mild, usually limited to minor digestive issues, suggesting that adding flavan-3-ol-rich foods to your diet is generally safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Supporting cardiovascular health&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the benefits were most pronounced in those with high blood pressure, even people with normal readings saw improvements in vascular function. This suggests flavan-3-ols may help prevent cardiovascular problems before they begin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure is one of the major drivers of heart disease worldwide, even at levels that &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10243231/"&gt;don’t qualify as full-blown hypertension&lt;/a&gt; (140/90 mmHg or higher). &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.072696#:%7E:text=The%202024%20European%20Society%20of,treat%20depends%20on%20the%20underlying"&gt;Recent guidelines&lt;/a&gt; from the European Society of Cardiology now recognise that even “elevated” blood pressure (120–139 systolic and 70–89 diastolic) carries increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle changes, particularly diet and exercise, are recommended by doctors as first-line strategies. But patients and even healthcare providers often lack clear, specific guidance on which foods truly make a difference. Our findings help fill this gap by showing that boosting flavan-3-ol intake through everyday foods may offer a simple, evidence-based way to support cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What about supplements?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some studies tested supplements or isolated flavan-3-ol compounds, but these generally showed smaller effects than whole foods like tea or cocoa. This may be because other beneficial compounds in whole foods work together, enhancing absorption and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At present, it appears both safer and more effective to focus on getting flavan-3-ols from foods rather than high-dose supplements, especially for people taking medications, since interactions are not fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The studies we reviewed suggest that 500–600 mg of flavan-3-ols daily may be enough to see benefits. You could reach this by combining two to three cups of green or black tea,  one to two servings (about 56g) of dark chocolate or two to three tablespoons of cocoa powder, two to three apples, plus other flavan-3-ol-rich fruits like grapes, pears and berries&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Eating apples, pears, grapes and berries could help support your heart health.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/organic-fruits-on-wooden-table-orchard-2180428261"&gt;Oksana Klymenko/Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small daily swaps, then, like trading a sugary snack for an apple and a piece of dark chocolate or adding an extra cup of tea, could gradually improve your heart health over time. Because flavan-3-ol content can vary between foods, monitoring your blood pressure at home may help you see if it’s making a difference for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More research is needed, particularly in people with diabetes, where the results were less consistent. We also need to better understand how flavan-3-ols interact with medications and whether even greater benefits can be achieved when combined with other healthy habits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the evidence is now strong enough to recommend flavan-3-ol-rich foods as part of a heart-healthy diet. As clinicians seek practical, affordable lifestyle strategies for patients, these findings bring us closer to the idea of using food as medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, flavan-3-ols aren’t a magic fix. They won’t replace medication for everyone. But combined with other healthy habits, they may offer a meaningful – and delicious – boost to cardiovascular health. And unlike many health fads, this isn’t about exotic superfoods or expensive powders. It’s about foods many of us already enjoy, used a little more intentionally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;"HPgV is a common, symptomless infection previously not known to frequently infect the brain," lead researcher Dr. Igor Koralnik, chief of neuroinfectious diseases and global neurology at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, said in a news release. "We were surprised to find it in the brains of Parkinson's patients at such high frequency and not in the controls."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus also appeared to prompt different responses from people's immune systems, depending on their genetics, Koralnik said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This suggests it could be an environmental factor that interacts with the body in ways we didn't realize before," Koralnik said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For a virus that was thought to be harmless, these findings suggest it may have important effects in the context of Parkinson's disease. It may influence how Parkinson's develops, especially in people with certain genetic backgrounds."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease occurs when &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain cells&lt;/a&gt; that produce an important hormone called dopamine begin to die off or become impaired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As dopamine levels decrease, people develop movement symptoms like shaking or stiffness, as well as problems maintaining balance and coordination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 1 million people in the U.S. live with Parkinson's disease, including actors Michael J. Fox and Alan Alda, singer Neil Diamond and football great Brett Favre. About 90,000 new cases are diagnosed every year, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Most cases of Parkinson's are not linked to a person's genetics, raising the question of what might trigger the death of dopamine-producing nerve cells, researchers said in background notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the new study, researchers autopsied the brains of 10 Parkinson's patients and 14 people not suffering from the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found HPgV in five out of 10 brains from people with Parkinson's, but none of the 14 healthy brains. The virus was also present in the spinal fluid of Parkinson's patients, but not in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, more &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+damage/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain damage&lt;/a&gt; was found in patients with HPgV, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, researchers tested &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/blood+samples/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;blood samples&lt;/a&gt; from more than 1,000 participants in the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative, a biosample library available for Parkinson's research. HPgV is a blood-borne virus in the same family as hepatitis C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only about 1% of Parkinson's patients had HPgV in their blood samples, researchers found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But people who had the virus showed different signals from their immune system, particularly those with a Parkinson's-related gene mutation called LRRK2, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We plan to look more closely at how genes like LRRK2 affect the body's response to other &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/viral+infections/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;viral infections&lt;/a&gt; to figure out if this is a special effect of HPgV or a broader response to viruses," Koralnik said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers plan to continue tracking how common the virus is among Parkinson's patients, and how it might trigger the brain disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"One big question we still need to answer is how often the virus gets into the brains of people with or without Parkinson's," Koralnik said. "We also aim to understand how viruses and genes interact; insights that could reveal how Parkinson's begins and could help guide future therapies."&lt;/p&gt;

					&lt;p&gt;As women head into their 40s and beyond, many notice how easily unwanted &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/simple-daily-exercises-belly-fat/" target="_blank"&gt;belly fat&lt;/a&gt; can accumulate, especially in the lower abdomen. An incredibly common concern is the “&lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/shrink-apron-belly-strength-training/" target="_blank"&gt;apron belly&lt;/a&gt;,” which refers to excess fat that hangs from the lower stomach, explains &lt;b&gt;Renee Simms, CPT&lt;/b&gt;, owner/founder at &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://alida126studio.shinepages.com/About" target="_blank"&gt;Alida 126 Personal Fitness&lt;/a&gt;. It resembles “an apron draped over the stomach,” she says. To help melt belly fat and tone this area, Renee recommends three essential exercises to add to your workout routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The apron belly becomes more common with age, mainly because of hormonal changes that happen as we approach menopause,” Renee points out. “Estrogen plays a big role in deciding where fat goes in a woman’s body—typically to the hips, thighs, and breasts. But as estrogen levels drop and testosterone levels rise with age, fat is more likely to settle in the belly. On top of that, metabolism tends to slow down, making it easier to gain weight. The skin also starts to lose collagen and elastin, which can cause it to sag—adding to the apron belly look.”&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;To address these natural age-related changes, Renee suggests performing &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/belly-fat-exercises-after-40-no-equipment/" target="_blank"&gt;exercises that fire up your entire body&lt;/a&gt; while activating your deep core muscles. Her top picks include the seesaw plank, marching glute bridge, and mountain climber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These moves don’t just challenge the core—they also trigger an ‘afterburn’ effect, where your body keeps burning calories even after the workout is over,” Renee explains. “Best of all, they help create that tighter, more supported feeling through the midsection, which can boost both posture and confidence. When done correctly and consistently, these exercises can make a real difference in how your body looks and feels. They help reduce belly fat, support your posture, strengthen your core, and ease lower back pain—making them a smart, sustainable choice for women navigating the physical shifts that come with midlife.” Here’s how to do them:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Begin in a high plank with your pelvis neutral and your core tight.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Keep the pace slow and controlled—it’s not about speed here, but about using good form and activating the right muscles,” Renee says. “Try not to sway side to side, and keep your head in a neutral position to avoid putting extra strain on your lower back.”&lt;/p&gt;

Haver &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-k-SI3iygw"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; she “fell in love” with weighted vests as a way to help her patients with osteoporosis. She &lt;a href="https://thepauselife.com/blogs/the-pause-blog/weighted-vests-for-bone-and-muscle-strength?srsltid=AfmBOoprtG01oOI16vzhpzjGmt0GN9QjcTqfsUonS-DMzkIUmUR2yH0e"&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; that by walking or working out in a weighted vest, “you can reap a multitude of benefits, ranging from stronger bones, increased muscle mass, and endurance to improve overall strength,” which she notes is crucial for women as they age.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxk78e001h3b775wuwdgt7@published" data-word-count="76"&gt;I’m still &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/what-is-perimenopause-symptoms-explained.html"&gt;years away from menopause&lt;/a&gt;, but it feels like everyone I know is &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/casey-johnston-weight-lifting-liftoff-profile.html"&gt;talking about how weight lifting has improved their life&lt;/a&gt;. After my sister told me she thinks strength training changed her metabolism, I invested in a pair of six-pound dumbbells, which mostly sit untouched in my living room. But I do like to walk, so I was intrigued: Would adding a weighted vest be a shortcut to some of the benefits of lifting?&lt;/p&gt;

The market is already crowded with options ranging from the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ZELUS-Weighted-Reflective-Strength-Weightlifting/dp/B081JLDJLB/ref=asc_df_B081JLDJLB?mcid=6d7acffc9b4e37ba830967e23534b3ec&amp;amp;hvocijid=18335661378070239616-B081JLDJLB-&amp;amp;hvexpln=73&amp;amp;tag=hyprod-20&amp;amp;linkCode=df0&amp;amp;hvadid=721245378154&amp;amp;hvpos=&amp;amp;hvnetw=g&amp;amp;hvrand=18335661378070239616&amp;amp;hvpone=&amp;amp;hvptwo=&amp;amp;hvqmt=&amp;amp;hvdev=c&amp;amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;amp;hvlocint=&amp;amp;hvlocphy=9004381&amp;amp;hvtargid=pla-2281435179778&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;ascsubtag=__c20709aam__cmcuxhsm9000l0idp0byl2ayk__________________" rel="sponsored,nofollow" data-track-type="product-link"&gt;$30 Zelus vest&lt;/a&gt; that’s &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@fabuloushaitian/video/7496982217026096430?q=weighted%20vest&amp;amp;t=1751986203244"&gt;all over TikTok&lt;/a&gt; to much pricier, heavier, and &lt;a href="https://www.trxtraining.com/products/trx-weight-vest?variant=43372603539596&amp;amp;country=US%C2%A4cy=USD&amp;amp;utm_medium=product_sync&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_content=sag_organic&amp;amp;utm_campaign=sag_organic&amp;amp;nbt=nb%3Aadwords%3Ag%3A22337365570%3A176519267019%3A738542319302&amp;amp;nb_adtype=pla&amp;amp;nb_kwd=&amp;amp;nb_ti=pla-293946777986&amp;amp;nb_mi=4622463&amp;amp;nb_pc=online&amp;amp;nb_pi=shopify_US_7955255427212_43372603539596&amp;amp;nb_ppi=293946777986&amp;amp;nb_placement=&amp;amp;nb_li_ms=&amp;amp;nb_lp_ms=&amp;amp;nb_fii=&amp;amp;nb_ap=&amp;amp;nb_mt=&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=22337365570&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD-FZK9B6OIDoYxlnJHekH0S-GwyR&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwgvnCBhCqARIsADBLZoKM5PDla-ZnP7gOLWAyBpZyt7eVPbIFAV6jp38g9OFpegCLMoF0a84aAgF4EALw_wcB"&gt;more tactical-looking ones&lt;/a&gt;. I decided to go with the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088NV9P1F?linkCode=ssc&amp;amp;tag=onamzmarycl08-20&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B088NV9P1F&amp;amp;asc_item-id=amzn1.ideas.1TSCBFDJDM6LX&amp;amp;ref_=aip_sf_list_spv_ofs_mixed_d_asin&amp;amp;ascsubtag=__c20709aam__cmcuxhsm9000l0idp0byl2ayk__________________" rel="sponsored,nofollow" data-track-type="product-link"&gt;$30 Prodigen vest&lt;/a&gt; that Haver includes in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/drmaryclairehaver/list/1TSCBFDJDM6LX?ref_=aip_sf_list_spv_ofs_mixed_d&amp;amp;tag=thecutonsite-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=__c20709aam__cmcuxhsm9000l0idp0byl2ayk__________________" rel="sponsored,nofollow" data-track-type="product-link"&gt;her Amazon Storefront&lt;/a&gt; (yes, she earns a commission). She recommends starting with a vest that’s around 5 percent of your body weight and eventually working up to 10 percent. My last pregnancy made my back sore enough that I could barely walk, so I decided to start conservatively with 8 pounds. However, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@theashleywill/video/7485779628435541279?q=weighted%20vest&amp;amp;t=1751040610575"&gt;plenty of women on TikTok&lt;/a&gt; say they quickly leveled up to 16- and 20-pound vests.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxkx8p002e3b77k0vfglrx@published" data-word-count="64"&gt;My vest arrived a few days later in a compact but heavy cardboard box. When I tried it on, it was surprisingly comfortable. There was something invigorating about wearing it. I suddenly wanted to stand up straighter and engage my core, like &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@flauntshe_/video/7485832370612981038?q=weighted%20vest&amp;amp;t=1751984427181"&gt;the TikTok videos advise&lt;/a&gt;. But it was definitely dorky looking. “You’re going to wear &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; on a walk?” my husband asked, smirking.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxl4ih002l3b77ewmv9h03@published" data-word-count="80"&gt;I generally try to avoid wearing things that call attention to themselves, especially when I’m exercising, so I was dreading wearing my vest out of the house. For my first outing, I was relieved it was drizzling so I could hide the vest under a raincoat while I walked to the grocery store. But it was bulky enough that I still felt ridiculous, especially inside the store, where I had to be extra careful not to accidentally bump into someone.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxl4ih002m3b77vrva4a8c@published" data-word-count="101"&gt;I quickly decided the vest was too embarrassing to wear while running errands. It felt weird to wear it with anything besides workout clothes, and the raised sleeves also make it annoying to carry a tote bag. But it didn’t seem to be making my back sore, so I started taking it on longer walks. After an hour of pushing the stroller on a 90-degree day, taking off the vest felt great. But at the same time, walking around with an extra eight pounds wasn’t&lt;em&gt; that&lt;/em&gt; hard. Was it really doing anything? I wondered whether I should buy a heavier one.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxl4ih002n3b77c1s2mfda@published" data-word-count="93"&gt;Going for a walk and listening to a podcast is usually one of my favorite activities. But while pages of Amazon reviewers gush about how much they love their vests, I mostly found it tedious. The extra weight made me feel constrained and awkward in a way that reminded me of pregnancy or walking with a baby carrier. It didn’t take long for me to start to resent the vest lying on the floor next to the front door, nagging me to make every trip out of the house a little less enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxlm9b00333b77l13dw456@published" data-word-count="63"&gt;As it turns out, my weighted vest probably wasn’t&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;doing much. “It’s being marketed as a one-stop fitness solution that is good for bone health and has benefits for muscle, and you can get those benefits from going on a couple of 30-minute walks per week,” says Lauren Colenso-Semple, a muscle physiology researcher at McMaster University. “But the evidence just does not support that.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxls9900393b77nway4j06@published" data-word-count="119"&gt;Colenso-Semple points out that most of the studies influencers cite to illustrate the benefits of the vests actually don’t involve walking. For example, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10995045/"&gt;the paper&lt;/a&gt; that Haver references when she claims that &lt;a href="https://thepauselife.com/blogs/the-pause-blog/weighted-vests-for-bone-and-muscle-strength?srsltid=AfmBOoprRXqYZKJ_kSqW-gj78Lm7rDHnePS6bYN4cFkRk3m3gDnr2Tki"&gt;weighted vests can help improve bone strength&lt;/a&gt; looked at women who wore vests while jumping. It’s a relevant distinction, since experts say high-impact exercise — like jumping — is beneficial for maintaining bone density (as opposed to walking, which is low impact). “There’s only one study that I’m aware of that looked at walking,” says Colenso-Semple, referring to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22338922/"&gt;a 2011 paper&lt;/a&gt; that looked at 48 women and found no difference (for bone health or otherwise) between women who walked with a weighted vest and those who walked without one.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxls9a003a3b777j8b6ye3@published" data-word-count="64"&gt;It’s worth noting that &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKhgKemAswE/?hl=en&amp;amp;img_index=1"&gt;both of these studies are very small&lt;/a&gt; — as are most of the studies cited by influencers pushing weighted vests. “I’m not saying it &lt;em&gt;doesn’t &lt;/em&gt;work, but the actual evidence is quite limited,” says Lora Giangregorio, a researcher in bone health and exercise science at the University of Waterloo who thinks walking in a weighted vest is “a waste of time.”&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxm2mt003l3b77l9rmics2@published" data-word-count="142"&gt;While weighted vests were initially pitched as a way for menopausal women to get stronger, it didn’t take long for women on TikTok to start claiming that adding one to their daily walk helped them &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kymberlychase/video/7515579949223316767?q=weighted%20vest%20weight%20loss%20&amp;amp;t=1751298137873"&gt;lose 30 pounds&lt;/a&gt;. But while wearing a vest might help you burn a few more calories — assuming it’s not so heavy that it slows you down — it does not appear to be a magic weight-loss hack. Colenso-Semple points out that in one &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32510046/"&gt;commonly cited study&lt;/a&gt;, participants wore a weighted vest for eight hours a day. Even then, people who wore a vest that was 11 percent of their body weight only lost 1.6 kilograms — about 3.5 pounds. Another study, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30095153/"&gt;in which participants tried to wear a vest for ten hours&lt;/a&gt; a day, found no additional benefit for weight loss — though some people did report a sore back.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxm8ka003r3b77vtx55zn8@published" data-word-count="44"&gt;Obviously, walking with a weighted vest can make it more challenging. But Giangregorio says that if your goal is to increase cardiovascular fitness, there are plenty of other, potentially more satisfying ways to do that, like walking on an incline, walking faster, or jogging.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxn10a00423b77kmkw6f4h@published" data-word-count="87"&gt;If your goal is to build muscle, there’s no shortcut around strength training, says Colenso-Semple. “You can use dumbbells, you can use machines, you can use barbells — but there has to be some resistance,” she says. Experts say that wearing the vest could be helpful to add resistance while you’re doing squats or lunges. But even then, the amount of weight you could reasonably add with a weighted vest might not be challenging enough, since to build muscle, you need to make the exercise harder over time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxn5ru00483b77j56m935z@published" data-word-count="45"&gt;“The key is to pick a version of the exercise that’s quite challenging, so you can only do somewhere between six and 12 reps,” says Giangregorio. “That’s a much more efficient way to build muscle than doing an activity you can do for 30 minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmcuxnerm004j3b77na14bbci@published" data-word-count="36"&gt;Definitely not. Personally, I’m thrilled to return to walking around unburdened by extra weight, and I’ll stick to jogging when I want something harder. This experiment did motivate me to do a few more push-ups, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chronic &lt;strong&gt;insomnia&lt;/strong&gt; is a condition that affects millions around the world, with treatments usually revolving around medications or lifestyle changes. But what if a simple, &lt;strong&gt;natural solution&lt;/strong&gt; could offer better results than the typical remedies? A recent study suggests that the answer might lie in an unexpected place: &lt;strong&gt;sex&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;New Study Challenges Traditional Sleep Aids&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/sleep/article/46/Supplement_1/A179/7181852?login=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, researchers have found that &lt;strong&gt;sexual activity&lt;/strong&gt; could be more effective than traditional &lt;strong&gt;sleeping pills&lt;/strong&gt; in improving sleep quality. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2024/11/why-do-we-wake-up-every-night-around-3-or-4-am/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="71992" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Insomnia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a common issue, with around 13% of the population in &lt;strong&gt;France&lt;/strong&gt; suffering from the condition. &lt;strong&gt;Women&lt;/strong&gt; are particularly affected, with 16.9% of women reporting chronic sleep problems, compared to just 9.1% of men. Despite the availability of &lt;strong&gt;sleeping pills&lt;/strong&gt;, many individuals still struggle to get the rest they need.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. &lt;strong&gt;Douglas Kirsch&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;sleep specialist&lt;/strong&gt;, and his team sought to explore an alternative method for improving sleep: sex. The team’s findings show that sexual activity, especially when accompanied by &lt;strong&gt;orgasm&lt;/strong&gt;, might trigger &lt;strong&gt;natural processes&lt;/strong&gt; in the body that promote relaxation and a better night’s sleep. This raises the intriguing possibility that &lt;strong&gt;sex&lt;/strong&gt; could be a natural remedy that rivals medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Closer Look at the Findings&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study was conducted with &lt;strong&gt;53 adults&lt;/strong&gt;, predominantly between the ages of 25 and 49, with &lt;strong&gt;53%&lt;/strong&gt; of participants being women. Each participant completed a survey that assessed the impact of sex on their sleep quality, and the results were compelling. &lt;strong&gt;Seventy-five percent&lt;/strong&gt; of respondents reported &lt;strong&gt;sleeping better&lt;/strong&gt; after engaging in sex, with many indicating that their sleep improved significantly on nights following sexual activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, a large portion of participants—around &lt;strong&gt;64%&lt;/strong&gt;—reported that &lt;strong&gt;sex&lt;/strong&gt; was as effective, or even more effective, than traditional sleeping pills. This is a notable finding, as many individuals turn to medication as their first line of defense against &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/03/why-we-sleep-more-but-feel-more-tired-than-our-prehistoric-ancestors-and-why-were-paying-for-it/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="83669" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sleep issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, these results suggest that a &lt;strong&gt;natural alternative&lt;/strong&gt; may provide comparable, if not superior, results.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Physiological Link Between Orgasm and Better Sleep&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that the key to this effect may lie in the &lt;strong&gt;physiological processes&lt;/strong&gt; that occur during &lt;strong&gt;orgasm&lt;/strong&gt;. During sexual activity, the body releases a number of &lt;strong&gt;hormones&lt;/strong&gt;, including &lt;strong&gt;oxytocin&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;endorphins&lt;/strong&gt;, which are known to promote feelings of relaxation and well-being. These hormones are often referred to as “&lt;strong&gt;feel-good&lt;/strong&gt;” chemicals and are responsible for the calming effects people feel after sexual activity. The release of these hormones might help to alleviate &lt;strong&gt;stress&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;anxiety&lt;/strong&gt;, making it easier for individuals to fall asleep and stay asleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;However, Dr. Kirsch and his team caution that the study’s &lt;strong&gt;observational nature&lt;/strong&gt; means that further research is required to definitively understand the link between sex and sleep. They also note that this research did not delve into the &lt;strong&gt;psychological aspects&lt;/strong&gt; of sex, particularly for individuals with negative associations with intimacy. In such cases, the effects on sleep could differ, and the study does not address the potential for trauma or discomfort in certain individuals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Limitations and the Need for Further Research&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the findings of this study are promising, experts stress that more comprehensive research is necessary to fully understand the &lt;strong&gt;mechanisms&lt;/strong&gt; at play. The study was observational and based on &lt;strong&gt;self-reported data&lt;/strong&gt;, meaning the results could be influenced by individual perceptions and biases. In addition, the sample size was relatively small, with only 53 participants. Future studies will need to include larger and more diverse groups to verify whether these results can be generalized to a broader population.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the study does not explore the impact of &lt;strong&gt;emotional intimacy&lt;/strong&gt; between partners on sleep quality, which could play a significant role. It’s possible that couples who are emotionally close might experience different sleep benefits from sex compared to those who are not. Additionally, the study did not consider the &lt;strong&gt;long-term effects&lt;/strong&gt; of using sex as a sleep aid, which would be an important avenue for future research.&lt;/p&gt;

Her charisma and ability to connect with people eventually led her to Bloomingdale’s, where she was hired to interview patrons during breakfast events; a unique role that catapulted her into the media spotlight. Her warm interactions and natural curiosity became the foundation for “The Sally Froelich Show,” a talk show that aired for over 20 years, engaging audiences with candid conversations and relatable topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The guests would talk to me, and the audience would ask questions. It was a lot of fun,” as reported by &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Healthline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;TV host Froelich joins ‘&lt;keyword id="27710578" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="SuperAgers-study" source="keywords"&gt;SuperAgers study&lt;/keyword&gt;’ to explore the science behind &lt;keyword id="21332343" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="healthy-aging" source="keywords"&gt;healthy aging&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the many topics she explored on her show, one series remains especially close to Froelich’s heart: “The Vital Years.” Launched when she was around 60 years old, the series focused on the challenges and joys of aging in later adulthood — including second marriages, staying active, health concerns, and grandparenting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, these conversations feel more relevant than ever, as Froelich participates in an innovative research project aiming to unlock the secrets of healthy aging. Froelich is one of 600 participants in the SuperAgers Family Study, run by the American Federation for Aging Research. This study is no small effort — it seeks to enroll 10,000 individuals aged 95 and older who are in good physical and cognitive health. But it’s not just about the SuperAgers themselves. The study also includes their adult children and the spouses of those children who don’t have SuperAger parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;95 year old woman shares 9 secrets to a long, healthy life&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although she may have longevity genes on her side, Froelich also practices many of the healthy lifestyle habits recommended by experts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I eat three meals a day. I don’t overeat,” she says. A balanced diet helps maintain energy, weight, and immune function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;She never smoked and drinks only in moderation. Research shows smokers are three times more likely to die prematurely of cardiovascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Froelich proudly notes that her weight hasn’t changed in 50 years, even though her body shape has. This stability helps reduce strain on joints and organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lifelong sports enthusiast, she continues to golf 2–3 times a week and exercises six days a week — including stretching, sit-ups, and weight training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Froelich keeps her mind sharp with bridge, audiobooks, and TV. Mental stimulation supports cognitive health and memory as we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;She dines out weekly, sees her children regularly, and checks in with her grandchildren via Zoom. Social interaction is linked to lower rates of depression and dementia. “If I’ve been hanging around the house a lot, I just go out and walk around the block,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her advice? “Do what you want to do and things that make you happy. Eat ice cream and delicious chocolate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Keep your hair done, your nails done… and have someone tell you if anything looks off,” she says. Looking after your appearance can boost mood and confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reframe how you think about aging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research shows that positive perceptions of aging can extend life by up to 7.5 years. “It’s not just about living longer — it’s about living better,” says Dr. Leipzig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why SuperAgers and their children hold the key to healthy aging&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They are just as important as the SuperAgers because we need to draw comparisons in the frequency of the genes,” said Dr. Sofiya Milman, Director of Human Longevity Studies at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal? To discover which genes are responsible for helping people live long, healthy, and disease-free lives. Past research suggests that certain genes may play a key role in exceptional longevity — including those that influence HDL cholesterol and growth hormone regulation. Dr. Milman and her team have found that genetics often outweigh lifestyle factors when it comes to reaching the age of 95 and beyond. “We found that [SuperAgers] didn’t differ in smoking, alcohol use, diet, or exercise compared to their peers — and yet, they lived significantly longer,” Milman explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How healthy habits can delay age-related diseases&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="67"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you didn’t win the genetic lottery, lifestyle choices remain critically important. While only 0.1% of Americans live to age 95 or older, the rest of the population can still dramatically reduce the risk of age-related diseases by adopting healthy habits. “It’s unlikely that a healthy lifestyle alone will get you to 95,” said Milman, “but it can delay the onset of illnesses like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Rosanne Leipzig, geriatrician and author of Honest Aging, genetics account for about 20–40% of longevity, while the remaining 60–80% is shaped by your environment and life experiences — including your childhood nutrition, education, access to healthcare, and even the neighborhood you grew up in. She also highlights the concept of “weathering” — the idea that chronic stress from systemic disadvantage, particularly among African American women, can impact long-term health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Also Read | &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/waking-up-with-a-headache-it-could-be-a-silent-sign-of-high-bp-experts-warn/articleshow/122337397.cms" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Waking up with a headache?

&lt;p&gt;Just like humans, dogs come with their own unique quirks and charms. So, if your furry baby has a sibling, there’s a possibility that they might be worlds apart beneath surface similarities. Likewise, this pet owner shared how her two dogs are “very different yet similar specimens” in an Instagram video that has since gone viral. The list includes all the things Moldy Dunkin can do, but Dunkin can’t.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-owner-shows-how-dogs-are-complete-opposites-in-viral-video"&gt;Owner shows how dogs are complete opposites in viral video&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a now-viral video, a pet owner shared how similar her two dogs are despite having completely different &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-blog/105518-study-compares-cognitive-traits-between-dog-breeds"&gt;traits&lt;/a&gt; that set them apart. Haley Deecken revealed a list of things that Moldy Dunkin and Dunkin do in their own unique ways, and the clips prove the various points, starting with walking past open cabinets. The post first showed the former passing by a cabinet left open in the kitchen without stopping, but Dunkin seemed to follow the procedure because that’s one thing he can’t do. The canine stopped to close it properly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next in line were belly rubs, and while Moldy Dunkin seemed to be enjoying his time with them, his brother didn’t want any. The clip showed the latter refusing to show his belly to his mom, unlike the other. Moreover, one appeared terrified of their mom’s belly rubs while the other was clearly giddy and ticklish with a beaming smile on his face. Then, it was about shutting up, and Moldy Dunkin proved he “can” zip it when their owner wants silence around the house. His brother, on the other hand, is not so much.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, the viral video showed the two dogs’ different reactions to food, and it’s as hilarious as it gets. Moldy Dunkin established he “can maintain eye contact” when it’s something sniff-worthy on the table, but Dunkin was more about “giving subtle hints” with his eyes and occasional glances. The highlight of the post was the humorous comments, including one urging the owner to “say sorry and give him his belly rubs.” Another pointed out how Dunkin was “crashing out because of open cabinets.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pb-in-article-content test-1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hailey Deecken later shared part two of a list of things that set her two dogs apart in a follow-up &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DL00KEoPgO-/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Instagram post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The deceased: &lt;/strong&gt;A 39-year-old woman in Belgrade, Serbia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The discovery:&lt;/strong&gt; The woman's ex-husband found the woman's body in her apartment and notified the police. She was lying on her left side on the living room couch, and her body was covered by a blanket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next: &lt;/strong&gt;Police removed the blanket to examine the body; the woman was naked from the waist down. There were no visible signs of violence or injury. The police then discovered an object protruding from the woman's bottom: a spring twirl whisk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its wooden handle had been inserted into her anus to a depth of about 4 inches (10 centimeters), penetrating her anus and rectum as "a dildo-like object," doctors wrote in &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22104332/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22104332/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a report of the case&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. According to the ex-husband, the woman had high blood pressure, also known as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;arterial hypertension&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for which she was taking medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The autopsy findings: &lt;/strong&gt;An examination of the woman's cranium revealed a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17871-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-sah" target="_blank" data-url="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17871-subarachnoid-hemorrhage-sah" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;subarachnoid hemorrhage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — bleeding in the space between the brain and a layer of tissue surrounding it. Blood had pooled to a depth of up to 0.2 inches (6 millimeters) around the base of the brain and the brainstem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When medical examiners cleared out the blood clots, they discovered a ruptured saccular aneurysm, a blood-filled sphere that ballooned from a blood vessel in the brain. This is also known as a "&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brain-aneurysm/symptoms-causes/syc-20361483" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brain-aneurysm/symptoms-causes/syc-20361483" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;berry aneurysm&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;" for its resemblance to a round berry dangling from a stem, and it is the most common type of aneurysm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The aneurysm measured 0.4 inches (11 millimeters) in diameter and had popped at the top of its dome. When aneurysms rupture, they release blood that can kill nearby brain cells and increase pressure inside the skull. As pressure builds, the flow of oxygen and blood to the brain may be disrupted, which can lead to unconsciousness and death. Aneurysms are &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bafound.org/news/why-women-are-more-likely-to-have-brain-aneurysm-than-men/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.bafound.org/news/why-women-are-more-likely-to-have-brain-aneurysm-than-men/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;more common in women&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than in men, especially in women with low estrogen levels, such as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.STR.30.7.1390" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.STR.30.7.1390" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;postmenopausal women&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

In the woman's case, her partial nudity, body posture and the presence of the whisk suggested that she was using the kitchen tool for anal self-stimulation, the report's authors wrote. Her sexual excitement and subsequent orgasm could have temporarily caused her blood pressure to spike enough to rupture the aneurysm, causing a fatal hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;Sexual activity is not a common cause of sudden death. In prior studies that evaluated a total of nearly 130,000 forensic autopsies, 195 of the deaths (0.15%) were linked to sex, and only a fraction of the deceased were women. When someone dies during or shortly after intercourse, it is usually an older male with a much younger female partner, and the cause of death is typically abrupt cardiac failure, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For women, sudden death during sex is often caused by a subarachnoid hemorrhage from a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557867/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557867/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;burst saccular aneurysm&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, this is the first case to present such a scenario for a woman's death during anal self-stimulation, the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-vUxPYREazuekiwTUExwDcZ-ZuGJm9Oaze5yNJrrIu8QZNwtDG5k0HHt" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-vUxPYREazuekiwTUExwDcZ-ZuGJm9Oaze5yNJrrIu8QZNwtDG5k0HHt slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuhxwqj002r27qebsisdwp6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The approval of the first &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/11/africa/malaria-us-foreign-aid-cuts-africa-intl"&gt;malaria&lt;/a&gt; treatment for newborns and young infants could lead to imminent widespread use in Africa, drugmaker Novartis said Tuesday.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuhyfax0006356n71qn2g5j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The drug, known as Coartem Baby or Riamet Baby in some countries, has been approved by Swiss authorities for use in babies weighing between 2 kilograms (4 pounds, 6 ounces) and 5 kilograms (11 pounds) and is formulated to be easy for them to take, Novartis said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcup7o7u00013b6m90xet236@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Coartem Baby already has approval in the West African nation of Ghana and Novartis said it now expects eight African countries to grant their own approvals within 90 days. The countries – Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda – also participated in the assessment of the drug.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuhyfay000e356n5r29uew4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vas Narasimhan, chief executive of Novartis, said in a news release that this first clinically proven malaria treatment for newborns and young babies ensures “even the smallest and most vulnerable can finally receive the care they deserve.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuhyfax0004356ntvh8zo19@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Until now, the smallest babies have been treated for malaria, a potentially deadly disease spread by mosquitoes, with medications designed for older children. Novartis, the Swiss pharmaceutical corporation behind the newly approved drug, says this can expose newborns to the risk of overdose and toxicity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuhyfax0005356n3mnljtaw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Most clinical trials have historically excluded babies under six months old,” Novartis spokesman Ruairidh Villar told CNN.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuhyfay000b356n0q9f7x43@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There were 263 million cases of malaria and 597,000 deaths in 2023 – nearly all of them in Africa, according to World Health Organization data. Children under the age of 5 accounted for about three in four malaria deaths in the region.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuhyfax0008356nrlnit4tn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The medicine was developed by Novartis in collaboration with the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), a Switzerland-based not-for-profit organization.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuhyfax0009356n0zdsky63@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Novartis told CNN that it plans to “roll out the medicine in the coming weeks on a largely not-for-profit basis.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuhyfay000c356nvv8zem83@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Malaria is one of the world’s deadliest diseases, particularly among children. But with the right resources and focus, it can be eliminated,” said Martin Fitchet, chief executive of MMV.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcuhyfay000d356n8qoxp5i4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The approval of Coartem Baby provides a necessary medicine with an optimized dose to treat an otherwise neglected group of patients and offers a valuable addition to the antimalarial toolbox.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

With tweezers, they parse through what resembles a mound of fake eyelashes, counting and documenting the mosquitoes by hand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Only some mosquitoes carry diseases.

When it reaches&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;around&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;10, then&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;there’s likely a problem,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;said Alissa Berro, director of Pinellas County Vegetation Management and Mosquito Control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Some staff are so accustomed to bites that they’ve developed an immunity to mosquito saliva, which can cause itchy, splotchy marks, said Caroline Scott, a senior environmental specialist for Pinellas County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;But not all mosquitoes bite people. Some take their “blood meals” (the unfortunate way researchers describe how&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;mosquitoes feed) from birds, reptiles or even leeches, Berro said. The bloodsuckers&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;are all female. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Trapping and identification is crucial for mosquito control to measure populations and plan how to handle them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h1"&gt;What to know about mosquito-borne illnesses&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The mosquitoes that officials typically look out for are the ones that carry diseases, like malaria, dengue or West Nile, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Thanks to mosquito control and air-conditioned homes, these diseases have become uncommon in the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article__body-image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="description" class="caption"&gt;A group of Red Star hens mill around in a holding coop at Pinellas County Mosquito Control in Clearwater.  &lt;span class="caption__credit"&gt;[ DOUGLAS R.

From 2019 to 2024, travel-related cases increased to more than 3,000, and locally acquired cases jumped to more than 400. That&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;rise could be higher considering that last year’s data may not be complete, Miley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“This is starting to be concerning,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Pasco County saw 11 cases of travel-related dengue and 13 cases of locally acquired dengue in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“Dengue is no longer a travel-related issue,” said Adriane Rogers, executive director of Pasco County Mosquito Control District, in an email to the Times. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Dengue has four different strains. If a person is infected with one strain, they may experience flu-like symptoms. If they are infected with a different strain later on, their immunity for the virus is lower and, in rare cases, they can die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“The rise in local cases means we all have a role to play — from public health officials and clinicians to everyday residents,”&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Rogers said, adding that mosquito-borne diseases often go unreported. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Miley and her team are creating a model that predicts the risk of dengue in Florida based on weather factors and land use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“At the end of the day, you have this risk model that potentially could be offered to mosquito control as a way to be more proactive,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article__body-image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="description" class="caption"&gt;Jars at Pinellas County Mosquito Control in Clearwater contain mosquitoes trapped from different parts of the county.  &lt;span class="caption__credit"&gt;[ DOUGLAS R. CLIFFORD  |  Times ]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;It’s difficult because there is no uniform reporting of mosquito populations across the state. Miley relies on mosquito programs to offer their data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Mosquito control officials in Florida meet annually to discuss trends and methodologies, and they often collaborate when an outbreak is occurring across county lines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;But mosquito control programs are ultimately silos, Miley said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h1"&gt;How mosquito control districts treat mosquitoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;In Tampa Bay, there’s typically a layered approach to attacking mosquitoes. The easiest and most effective way is getting to them before they can fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;When they’re flying, “they’re hard to trap, and they’re also biting people and possibly spreading disease,” Scott said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Mosquitoes need water to breed. Without it, they can’t thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Most mosquito control programs breed mosquito-eating fish and give them out to the public for free. The fish, aptly named mosquitofish, have spoon-shaped mouths that can suck up the larvae wriggling on the water’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article__body-image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="description" class="caption"&gt;Mosquito larvae swim in an observation dish under a microscope. The larvae are observed to identify the species, their stage of development and the efficacy of larvicides. &lt;span class="caption__credit"&gt;[ DOUGLAS R. CLIFFORD  |  Times ]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Mosquito officials also use larvicides and insecticides to target the insects. They often rear the bugs in-house to test their resistance levels, sometimes at state labs.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Mosquito control officials in Pinellas, Hillsborough and Pasco also respond to public requests to fight mosquito populations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;There are certain criteria, like a high number of mosquitoes found in an area, before mosquito officials can spray a larger area than a requested home or business, Berro said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Officials use people, vans or even helicopters to treat areas where mosquitoes have become an issue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article__body-image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="description" class="caption"&gt;Mary Bolton prepares chunks of dry ice for mosquito traps. The dry ice attracts mosquitoes, which are drawn to the carbon dioxide in human and animal breath.  &lt;span class="caption__credit"&gt;[ DOUGLAS R. CLIFFORD  |  Times ]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="h1"&gt;Florida’s weather is a mosquito’s paradise&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Florida’s warm weather means mosquitoes can survive through the seasons. Heat combined with rainfall can influence a mosquito’s life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;In the summer, mosquitoes can go from egg to adult in three to five days. In the winter, it could take a week or longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The average lifespan of an adult mosquito can be anywhere from two weeks to two months, Scott said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And climate change is extending warmer weather seasons, allowing mosquito populations to thrive longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Hurricanes can also prolong&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;mosquitoes’ active time, dumping more rain and leading to more standing water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“We’ve seen&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;a vast increase in these extreme weather patterns, and the last couple of hurricane seasons have left a lot of debris,” Miley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Storm debris can sit out for weeks, providing a perfect breeding ground. That’s why experts say it’s so important to drain standing water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Eradicating mosquitoes is not the goal, Rogers said. Some populations are pollinators or food sources for other animals. Instead, mosquito control seeks to keep dangerous populations at bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;“It’s a delicate balance,” Rogers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The effort to hold back mosquito populations in Florida is massive. There is no silver bullet, Rogers said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Instead, there are myriad methods, from complex science and expensive equipment to the sentinel chickens — still oblivious to their role in the persistent battle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="article__body-align article__body-align-center"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;• • •&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;i&gt;Times staff writer Gabrielle Calise contributed to this report. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__body-float article__body-float-left"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Tampa Bay Times launched the Environment Hub in 2025 to focus on some of Florida‘s most urgent and enduring challenges.

Her doctor recommended one, she said, after she complained of feeling tired. She didn’t think it helped, but she kept taking it anyway. When she decided to stop taking the drug 10 years later, her doctor helped her taper off it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, this went fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And then, six to nine months later, I started feeling horrible,” she said. “I had nerve pain. My neck and shoulders were sore all the time. My anxiety was through the roof.” These were symptoms Munari had never experienced before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Munari, who lives in New Brunswick, Canada, said she became so exhausted and physically weak she found it difficult to continue her job at a call center. She spent much of the next two years in bed. To receive disability, she agreed to go back on the drug she’d been on, Effexor. She then weaned off it again, this time much more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nerve pain and exhaustion gradually improved, she said, but the anxiety got worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I had complete panic. I couldn’t leave the house,” she said. Driving in the car, she said, “I’d be in the passenger seat with my eyes closed.” It took two more years before things began to improve, she said in an interview as she choked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Munari is one of the tens of thousands of people who have turned to online forums to discuss lasting health problems after going off antidepressants. Many say their doctors didn’t warn them this could happen, and didn’t believe them when they said they were having a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors have long understood that stopping antidepressants can cause short-term withdrawal, with patients &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/12602_discontinuation-symptoms-treatment-serotonin-reuptake.pdf"&gt;suffering from symptoms&lt;/a&gt; like dizziness, anxiety, insomnia and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What most prescribers and patients don’t understand is that “you can have symptoms that persist for long periods after you stop them,” said British psychiatrist Mark Horowitz, who specializes in antidepressant withdrawal. According to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33489088/"&gt;one analysis&lt;/a&gt; of patient narratives, people who experienced long-term withdrawal suffered for an average of eight years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although psychiatrists have been documenting cases like Munari’s for decades, no large-scale studies on the problem exist. Because of that, experts still disagree on how common this kind of condition is, how to prevent it, or even what to call it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It should be very concerning to the medical system and the public that there are tens of millions of people walking around on drugs whose long-term exposure and withdrawal effects we do not understand,” Horowitz said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, survivors of antidepressant withdrawal and related conditions are coming together online and pushing for education, research and recognition. They say prescribers must inform themselves about these issues and warn patients about them before starting or keeping them on the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

        After spending 13 years on antidepressants, Sven Huber, from western Germany, had lasting problems after stopping the drugs.
      &lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sven Huber found himself Googling depression symptoms in 2009 after reading media coverage of a German soccer player’s suicide that November. The symptoms, he said, “fit on me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huber, a 35-year-old living in western Germany, spent the next 13 years on antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His doctor first prescribed him one drug, which helped with his depression but made him sleepy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huber said he then switched to escitalopram (marketed as Lexapro), but that one was even worse. The day after he started it, Huber said, his genitals went numb and his emotions became blunted. He lost his libido, his vision went blurry, his feet felt like they were burning, and his cognition and short-term memory became unreliable, he said. “It felt like a switch was flipped,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huber’s doctor recommended he wean off the medication over a few weeks. But immediately, Huber began experiencing sensations like electrical shocks in his head, known in psychiatry as “brain zaps.” He grew anxious, confused, and had suicidal thoughts he’d never had before. All of these are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32259826/"&gt;documented symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of antidepressant withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huber went back on the escitalopram. It seemed he had to choose: Endure extreme side effects or excruciating withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For nine years, Huber struggled to taper off the drugs, failing to quit them five times. Finally, a year and a half ago, he took his last dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain zaps, anxiety and suicidal thoughts all resolved, he said, but the blurry vision, burning feet, sexual dysfunction and emotional numbness persisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can’t relate to any family members or friends,” he said. “Before I took it, I had feelings — bad feelings often — but I felt something. And now I do not feel anything at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This emptiness, he said, is the hardest to bear. “I would just like to feel like a human,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="h3_side_effects_that_may_never_go_away"&gt;Side effects that may never go away&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lasting problems after withdrawal like Huber’s probably occur very infrequently, estimates Nassir Ghaemi, a prominent psychiatrist and professor at Tufts University’s School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I would say it’s an unknown minority of patients who may have this kind of side effect long term,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But doctors who specialize in antidepressant withdrawal say the true risk of severe and lasting symptoms may be obscured by the fact that many patients try and fail to stop the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never seen anybody come off long-term Effexor or Cymbalta and not have years of trouble,” said Horowitz, the British psychiatrist. While these two drugs are known to be harder to stop, Horowitz said he also frequently sees severe and lasting problems among patients coming off drugs with less risk for withdrawal, like fluoxetine (marketed as Prozac) and escitalopram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some people, Horowitz said, these symptoms only begin after stopping the drug, while for others, the symptoms begin like side effects during treatment and get worse after stopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While patients and researchers often refer to lasting problems as “protracted withdrawal,” Horowitz and other specialists have suggested terms like “serotonin-induced neurological dysfunction” or “antidepressant withdrawal injury” as umbrella terms for the phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horowitz’s &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178125001453?via%3Dihub"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; the longer someone stays on antidepressants, the more likely they are to suffer from severe and long-lasting conditions after stopping them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghaemi and Horowitz both said it’s important for anyone considering it not to stop antidepressants cold turkey, but rather to carefully taper off of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antidepressants can be helpful for short-term relief, said Ghaemi. But for depression, they are most effective in the first six months of use, he said, and “shouldn’t be given routinely for years and decades. I think that’s where we’re running into problems.” For certain conditions, he adds, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, long-term use may be recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Eli Lilly, which makes Cymbalta and Prozac, and AbbVie which makes Lexapro, declined to comment for this story. APM Reports and NPR could not reach Viatris, which makes Effexor for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="h3_%E2%80%98that%E2%80%99s_historic%E2%80%99"&gt;‘That’s historic’&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huber was relieved to learn he wasn’t alone when he discovered online forums full of people with stories like his, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PSSD/"&gt;Reddit page&lt;/a&gt; geared specifically toward people with PSSD, or post-SSRI sexual dysfunction, people talk about having “genital anaesthesia” and no libido while taking and after stopping antidepressants. Many also share the emotional numbness Huber described, saying they can no longer experience love, joy or pleasure, a phenomenon doctors call anhedonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading these, “I knew I wasn’t crazy,” Huber said. But it was scary to learn how long people were suffering for, and that there wasn’t a cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That page has grown from 700 to 16,000 subscribers over the past five years. Other groups have grown too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A forum called &lt;a href="http://survivingantidepressants.org"&gt;Surviving Antidepressants&lt;/a&gt; has 23,000 members. A Facebook group that helps users taper off the antidepressant Cymbalta has 43,000 members.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Many more exist on different platforms, for specific drugs and in various languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While pharmaceutical companies have poured billions into efforts to show antidepressants work, relatively few studies have explored the drugs’ negative effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frustrated by the absence of research, advocates are lobbying governments and the medical establishment to fund studies that could reveal the conditions’ prevalence, causes, and possible cures. Some patients are spending their own money on research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nonprofit PSSD Network has raised more than $200,000 for research over the past two years, which it directs to a research team at the University of Milan, in Italy. And in response to pressure from the Canadian PSSD Society, the Canadian government recently began funding research into PSSD through small grants through the University of British Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That’s historic,” Nick Alves, a spokesperson for the PSSD Network said&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;about this kind of institutional involvement. “That’s huge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another organization, the &lt;a href="https://antidepressantinfo.org/"&gt;Antidepressant Coalition for Education&lt;/a&gt;, is pushing people to report their withdrawal experiences to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adele Framer started the online forum Surviving Antidepressants in 2011, following seven years of withdrawal symptoms after quitting an antidepressant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the website, volunteer moderators share best practices for tapering, often referring to a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Maudsley-Guidelines-prescribing-Prescribing/dp/111982298X"&gt;handbook&lt;/a&gt; for doctors written by Horowitz, the British psychiatrist. His method of reducing one’s dose gradually — by 10% of the previous dose each month over a year or more, for example — differs dramatically from the standard medical guidance of tapering over a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Framer has worked with researchers to extract patient narratives from the forum into data that can be analyzed. This data has been used in many published studies. For example, one sought to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33489088/"&gt;establish the duration&lt;/a&gt; and common symptoms of protracted withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a hidden public health problem in people experiencing withdrawal symptoms because they and their doctors don’t know how to gradually reduce the dosage,” she said, and “people don’t learn this stuff in medical school.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, Framer has turned her attention to a new endeavor: a nonprofit called the Psychotropic Deprescribing Council, which she founded in 2023. The council’s goals are to develop best practices for tapering off psychotropic medications to minimize risk of withdrawal symptoms and relapse, and to inform clinicians about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, the influential American Psychiatric Association appears to be paying attention. Dr. Alan Schatzberg, a Stanford psychiatrist and consultant to the APA, said he thinks depression is worse than withdrawal symptoms, and warned “we would not want people not to take the medications.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But because the group received complaints about PSSD from patients, he said, the APA’s research council has begun to review the literature on PSSD and other lasting problems from antidepressants. It will publish the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horowitz, the British psychiatrist, said he welcomes the APA’s interest, but a review of the literature will likely be inadequate. “When you do a review, you’re only reviewing what exists,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;existing studies on modern antidepressants, known as SSRIs and SNRIs, weren’t designed to assess withdrawal or long-term use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horowitz said he’d like to see government-funded research that follows long-term antidepressant users’ experiences after they stop the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether this is likely in the U.S. is uncertain. On the one hand, Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is an outspoken critic of antidepressants. On the other hand, the Trump administration has cut federal funding for biomedical research as well as staffing at federal health agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Horowitz said he believes the APA’s literature review is a sign patients and advocates are being heard. “It means that pressure has got somewhere.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Princeton University and the Simons Foundation have identified four clinically and biologically distinct subtypes of autism, marking a transformative step in understanding the condition's genetic underpinnings and potential for personalized care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Analyzing data from over 5,000 children in &lt;a href="https://sparkforautism.org/portal/page/about-spark" target="_blank"&gt;SPARK&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/autism/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; cohort study, the researchers used a computational model to group individuals based on their combinations of traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team used a "person-centered" approach that considered a broad range of over 230 traits in each individual, from social interactions to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/repetitive+behaviors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;repetitive behaviors&lt;/a&gt; to developmental milestones, rather than searching for &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+links/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic links&lt;/a&gt; to single traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach enabled the discovery of clinically relevant autism subtypes, which the researchers linked to distinct genetic profiles and developmental trajectories, offering new insights into the biology underlying autism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their results were &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-025-02224-z" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Genetics&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Understanding the genetics of autism is essential for revealing the biological mechanisms that contribute to the condition, enabling earlier and more accurate diagnosis, and guiding personalized care," said senior study author Olga Troyanskaya, director of Princeton Precision Health, the Maduraperuma/Khot Professor of Computer Science and the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics at Princeton, and deputy director for genomics at the Center for Computational Biology of the Simons Foundation's Flatiron Institute.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The study defines four subtypes of autism—Social and Behavioral Challenges, Mixed ASD with Developmental Delay, Moderate Challenges, and Broadly Affected. Each subtype exhibits distinct developmental, medical, behavioral and psychiatric traits, and importantly, different patterns of genetic variation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals in the Social and Behavioral Challenges group show core autism traits, including social challenges and repetitive behaviors, but generally reach developmental milestones at a pace similar to children without autism. They also often experience co-occurring conditions like ADHD, anxiety, depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder alongside autism. One of the larger groups, this constitutes around 37% of the participants in the study.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Mixed ASD with Developmental Delay group tends to reach developmental milestones, such as walking and talking, later than children without autism, but usually does not show signs of anxiety, depression or disruptive behaviors. "Mixed" refers to differences within this group with respect to repetitive behaviors and social challenges. This group represents approximately 19% of the participants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals with Moderate Challenges show core autism-related behaviors, but less strongly than those in the other groups, and usually reach &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/developmental+milestones/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;developmental milestones&lt;/a&gt; on a similar track to those without autism. They generally do not experience co-occurring psychiatric conditions. Roughly 34% of participants fall into this category.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Broadly Affected group faces more extreme and wide-ranging challenges, including developmental delays, social and communication difficulties, repetitive behaviors and co-occurring psychiatric conditions like anxiety, depression and mood dysregulation. This is the smallest group, accounting for around 10% of the participants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings are powerful because the classes represent different clinical presentations and outcomes, and critically, we were able to connect them to distinct underlying biology," said Aviya Litman, a Ph.D. student at Princeton and co-lead author.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Distinct genetics behind the subtypes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For decades, autism researchers and clinicians have been seeking robust definitions of autism subtypes to aid in diagnosis and care. Autism is known to be highly heritable, with many implicated genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"While &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+testing/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic testing&lt;/a&gt; is already part of the standard of care for people diagnosed with autism, thus far, this testing reveals variants that explain the autism of only about 20% of patients," said study co-author Jennifer Foss-Feig, a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/clinical+psychologist/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;clinical psychologist&lt;/a&gt; at the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and vice president and senior scientific officer at the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study takes an approach that differs from classic gene discovery efforts by identifying robust autism subtypes that are linked to distinct types of genetic mutations and affected biological pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, children in the Broadly Affected group showed the highest proportion of damaging de novo mutations—those not inherited from either parent—while only the Mixed ASD with Developmental Delay group was more likely to carry rare inherited genetic variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While children in both of these subtypes share some important traits like developmental delays and intellectual disability, these genetic differences suggest distinct mechanisms behind superficially similar clinical presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings point to specific hypotheses linking various pathways to different presentations of autism," said Litman, referring to differences in biology between children with different autism subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the researchers identified divergent biological processes affected in each subtype. "What we're seeing is not just one biological story of autism, but multiple distinct narratives," said Natalie Sauerwald, associate research scientist at the Flatiron Institute and co-lead author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This helps explain why past genetic studies often fell short—it was like trying to solve a jigsaw puzzle without realizing we were actually looking at multiple different puzzles mixed together. We couldn't see the full picture, the genetic patterns, until we first separated individuals into subtypes."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                        
    &lt;p class="w-100 mb-4 ads"&gt;
          
        
        &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-0536483524803400" data-ad-slot="7099578867"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Autism biology unfolds on different timelines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also found that autism subtypes differ in the timing of genetic disruptions' effects on brain development. Genes switch on and off at specific times, guiding different stages of development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While much of the genetic impact of autism was thought to occur before birth, in the Social and Behavioral Challenges subtype—which typically has substantial social and psychiatric challenges, no developmental delays, and a later diagnosis—mutations were found in genes that become active later in childhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that, for these children, the biological mechanisms of autism may emerge after birth, aligning with their later clinical presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"By integrating genetic and clinical data at scale, we can now begin to map the trajectory of autism from &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/biological+mechanisms/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;biological mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; to clinical presentation," said co-author Chandra Theesfeld, senior academic research manager at the Lewis-Sigler Institute and Princeton Precision Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A paradigm shift for autism research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study builds on more than a decade of autism genomics research &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-05-artificial-intelligence-class-mutations-autism.html"&gt;led by Troyanskaya and collaborators&lt;/a&gt;. It is enabled by the close integration of interdisciplinary expertise in genomics, clinical psychology, molecular biology, computer science and modeling, and computational biology—with experts from Princeton Precision Health, the Flatiron Institute and SFARI.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"It's a whole new paradigm, to provide these groups as a starting point for investigating the genetics of autism," said Theesfeld. Instead of searching for a biological explanation that encompasses all individuals with autism, researchers can now investigate the distinct genetic and biological processes driving each subtype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shift could reshape both autism research and clinical care—helping clinicians anticipate different trajectories in diagnosis, development and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The ability to define biologically meaningful autism subtypes is foundational to realizing the vision of precision medicine for neurodevelopmental conditions," said Sauerwald.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the current work defines four subtypes, "this doesn't mean there are only four classes," said Litman. "It means we now have a data-driven framework that shows there are at least four—and that they are meaningful in both the clinic and the genome."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For families navigating autism, knowing which subtype of autism their child has can offer new clarity, tailored care, support and community. "Understanding genetic causes for more individuals with autism could lead to more targeted developmental monitoring, precision treatment, and tailored support and accommodations at school or work," said Foss-Feig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It could tell families, when their children with autism are still young, something more about what symptoms they might—or might not—experience, what to look out for over the course of a lifespan, which treatments to pursue, and how to plan for their future."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond its contributions to understanding autism subtypes and their underlying biology, the study offers a powerful framework for characterizing other complex, heterogeneous conditions and finding clinically relevant disease subtypes. As Theesfeld put it: "This opens the door to countless new scientific and clinical discoveries."&lt;/p&gt;

                Phillipa Munari suffered nerve pain and exhaustion after she stopped taking antidepressants. She struggled to train her horse, Bella, and "could barely walk because of the withdrawal," said Munari. "I spent 20 hours in bed most days for two years."

   &lt;p&gt;Phillipa Munari started antidepressants in 2003. Her doctor recommended one, she said, after she complained of feeling tired. She didn't think it helped, but she kept taking it anyway. When she decided to stop taking the drug 10 years later, her doctor helped her taper off it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At first, this went fine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"And then, six to nine months later, I started feeling horrible," she said. "I had nerve pain. My neck and shoulders were sore all the time. My anxiety was through the roof." These were symptoms Munari had never experienced before.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Munari, who lives in New Brunswick, Canada, said she became so exhausted and physically weak she found it difficult to continue her job at a call center. She spent much of the next two years in bed. To receive disability, she agreed to go back on the drug she'd been on, Effexor. She then weaned off it again, this time much more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The nerve pain and exhaustion gradually improved, she said, but the anxiety got worse.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I had complete panic. I couldn't leave the house," she said. Driving in the car, she said, "I'd be in the passenger seat with my eyes closed." It took two more years before things began to improve, she said in an interview as she choked up&lt;strong&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Munari is one of the tens of thousands of people who have turned to online forums to discuss lasting health problems after going off antidepressants. Many say their doctors didn't warn them this could happen, and didn't believe them when they said they were having a problem.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Doctors have long understood that stopping antidepressants can cause short-term withdrawal, with patients &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/12602_discontinuation-symptoms-treatment-serotonin-reuptake.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;suffering from symptoms&lt;/a&gt; like dizziness, anxiety, insomnia and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;What most prescribers and patients don't understand is that "you can have symptoms that persist for long periods after you stop them," said British psychiatrist Mark Horowitz, who specializes in antidepressant withdrawal. According to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33489088/" target="_blank"&gt;one analysis&lt;/a&gt; of patient narratives, people who experienced long-term withdrawal suffered for an average of eight years.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Although psychiatrists have been documenting cases like Munari's for decades, no large-scale studies on the problem exist. Because of that, experts still disagree on how common this kind of condition is, how to prevent it, or even what to call it.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"It should be very concerning to the medical system and the public that there are tens of millions of people walking around on drugs whose long-term exposure and withdrawal effects we do not understand," Horowitz said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, survivors of antidepressant withdrawal and related conditions are coming together online and pushing for education, research and recognition. They say prescribers must inform themselves about these issues and warn patients about them before starting or keeping them on the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;'Before I took it, I had feelings'&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-76668" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                After spending 13 years on antidepressants, Sven Huber, from western Germany, had lasting problems after stopping the drugs.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Sven Huber found himself Googling depression symptoms in 2009 after reading media coverage of a German soccer player's suicide that November. The symptoms, he said, "fit on me."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Huber, a 35-year-old living in western Germany, spent the next 13 years on antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;His doctor first prescribed him one drug, which helped with his depression but made him sleepy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Huber said he then switched to escitalopram (marketed as Lexapro), but that one was even worse. The day after he started it, Huber said, his genitals went numb and his emotions became blunted. He lost his libido, his vision went blurry, his feet felt like they were burning, and his cognition and short-term memory became unreliable, he said. "It felt like a switch was flipped," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Huber's doctor recommended he wean off the medication over a few weeks. But immediately, Huber began experiencing sensations like electrical shocks in his head, known in psychiatry as "brain zaps." He grew anxious, confused, and had suicidal thoughts he'd never had before. All of these are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32259826/" target="_blank"&gt;documented symptoms&lt;/a&gt; of antidepressant withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you or someone you know is in crisis, contact the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://988lifeline.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;988 Suicide &amp;amp; Crisis Lifeline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; via call, text or chat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Huber went back on the escitalopram. It seemed he had to choose: Endure extreme side effects or excruciating withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For nine years, Huber struggled to taper off the drugs, failing to quit them five times. Finally, a year and a half ago, he took his last dose.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The brain zaps, anxiety and suicidal thoughts all resolved, he said, but the blurry vision, burning feet, sexual dysfunction and emotional numbness persisted.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I can't relate to any family members or friends," he said. "Before I took it, I had feelings – bad feelings often – but I felt something. And now I do not feel anything at all."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This emptiness, he said, is the hardest to bear. "I would just like to feel like a human," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Side effects that may never go away&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lasting problems after withdrawal like Huber's probably occur very infrequently, estimates Nassir Ghaemi, a prominent psychiatrist and professor at Tufts University's School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I would say it's an unknown minority of patients who may have this kind of side effect long term," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;But doctors who specialize in antidepressant withdrawal say the true risk of severe and lasting symptoms may be obscured by the fact that many patients try and fail to stop the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I've never seen anybody come off long-term Effexor or Cymbalta and not have years of trouble," said Horowitz, the British psychiatrist. While these two drugs are known to be harder to stop, Horowitz said he also frequently sees severe and lasting problems among patients coming off drugs with less risk for withdrawal, like fluoxetine (marketed as Prozac) and escitalopram.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For some people, Horowitz said, these symptoms only begin after stopping the drug, while for others, the symptoms begin like side effects during treatment and get worse after stopping.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While patients and researchers often refer to lasting symptoms as "protracted withdrawal," Horowitz and other specialists have suggested terms like "serotonin-induced neurological dysfunction" or "antidepressant withdrawal injury" as umbrella terms for the phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Horowitz's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165178125001453?via%3Dihub" target="_blank"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; the longer someone stays on antidepressants, the more likely they are to suffer from severe and long-lasting conditions after stopping them.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Ghaemi and Horowitz both said it's important for anyone considering it not to stop antidepressants cold turkey, but rather to carefully taper off of them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Antidepressants can be helpful for short-term relief, said Ghaemi. But for depression, they are most effective in the first six months of use, he said, and "shouldn't be given routinely for years and decades. I think that's where we're running into problems." For certain conditions, he adds, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, long-term use may be recommended.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Eli Lilly, which makes Cymbalta and Prozac, and AbbVie which makes Lexapro, declined to comment for this story. APM Reports and NPR could not reach Viatris, which makes Effexor for comment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;'That's historic'&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Huber was relieved to learn he wasn't alone when he discovered online forums full of people with stories like his, he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PSSD/" target="_blank"&gt;Reddit page&lt;/a&gt; geared specifically toward people with PSSD, or post-SSRI sexual dysfunction, people talk about having "genital anesthesia" and no libido while taking and after stopping antidepressants. Many also share the emotional numbness Huber described, saying they can no longer experience love, joy or pleasure, a phenomenon doctors call anhedonia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Reading these, "I knew I wasn't crazy," Huber said. But it was scary to learn how long people were suffering for, and that there wasn't a cure.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That page has grown from 700 to 16,000 subscribers over the past five years. Other groups have grown too.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A forum called &lt;a href="http://survivingantidepressants.org" target="_blank"&gt;Surviving Antidepressants&lt;/a&gt; has 23,000 members. A Facebook group that helps users taper off the antidepressant Cymbalta has 43,000 members.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Many more exist on different platforms, for specific drugs and in various languages.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While pharmaceutical companies have poured billions into efforts to show antidepressants work, relatively few studies have explored the drugs' negative effects.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Frustrated by the absence of research, advocates are lobbying governments and the medical establishment to fund studies that could reveal the conditions' prevalence, causes, and possible cures. Some patients are spending their own money on research.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The nonprofit PSSD Network has raised more than $200,000 for research over the past two years, which it directs to a research team at the University of Milan, in Italy. And in response to pressure from the Canadian PSSD Society, the Canadian government recently began funding research into PSSD through small grants through the University of British Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"That's historic," Nick Alves, a spokesperson for the PSSD Network said&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;about this kind of institutional involvement. "That's huge."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another organization, the &lt;a href="https://antidepressantinfo.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Antidepressant Coalition for Education&lt;/a&gt;, is pushing people to report their withdrawal experiences to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-76669" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

                After experiencing seven years of withdrawal symptoms from Paxil, Adele Framer started an online community forum in 2011.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;'People don't learn this stuff in medical school'&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Adele Framer started the online forum Surviving Antidepressants in 2011, following seven years of withdrawal symptoms after quitting an antidepressant.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On the website, volunteer moderators share best practices for tapering, often referring to a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Maudsley-Guidelines-prescribing-Prescribing/dp/111982298X" target="_blank"&gt;handbook&lt;/a&gt; for doctors written by Horowitz, the British psychiatrist. His method of reducing one's dose gradually – by 10% of the previous dose each month over a year or more, for example – differs dramatically from the standard medical guidance of tapering over a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Framer has worked with researchers to extract patient narratives from the forum into data that can be analyzed. This data has been used in many published studies. For example, one sought to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33489088/" target="_blank"&gt;establish the duration&lt;/a&gt; and common symptoms of protracted withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"There's a hidden public health problem in people experiencing withdrawal symptoms because they and their doctors don't know how to gradually reduce the dosage," she said, and "people don't learn this stuff in medical school."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Recently, Framer has turned her attention to a new endeavor: a nonprofit called the Psychotropic Deprescribing Council, which she founded in 2023. The council's goals are to develop best practices for tapering off psychotropic medications to minimize risk of withdrawal symptoms and relapse, and to inform clinicians about them.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And now, the influential American Psychiatric Association appears to be paying attention. Dr. Alan Schatzberg, a Stanford psychiatrist and consultant to the APA, said he thinks depression is worse than withdrawal symptoms, and warned "we would not want people not to take the medications."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But because the group received complaints about PSSD from patients, he said, the APA's research council has begun to review the literature on PSSD and other lasting problems from antidepressants. It will publish the results.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Horowitz, the British psychiatrist, said he welcomes the APA's interest, but a review of the literature will likely be inadequate. "When you do a review, you're only reviewing what exists," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;existing studies on modern antidepressants, known as SSRIs and SNRIs, weren't designed to assess withdrawal or long-term use.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Horowitz said he'd like to see government-funded research that follows long-term antidepressant users' experiences after they stop the drugs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Whether this is likely in the U.S. is uncertain. On the one hand, Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is an outspoken critic of antidepressants. On the other hand, the Trump administration has cut federal funding for biomedical research as well as &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/06/nx-s1-5424670/rfk-jr-samhsa-mental-health-addiction-overdose-trump-budget-cuts" target="_blank"&gt;staffing at federal health agencies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Horowitz said he believes the APA's literature review is a sign patients and advocates are being heard. "It means that pressure has got somewhere."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was produced by&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apmreports.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt; APM Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, the investigative reporting unit at American Public Media.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new analysis, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/advance-article/doi/10.1093/biosci/biaf100/8185759?searchresult=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;BioScience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, shows that only around 1% of individuals are affected – far less than in &lt;a href="https://www.discoverwildlife.com/animal-facts/mammals/which-mammal-lives-the-longest"&gt;mammals&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.discoverwildlife.com/animal-facts/birds/which-bird-has-the-largest-beak"&gt;birds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the study (which was led by Dr Ylenia Chiari from the University of Nottingham alongside Dr Scott Glaberman from the University of Birmingham), the team worked in collaboration with researchers from zoos across the UK, US and Europe to analyse medical records and necropsies (autopsies) from hundreds of zoo turtles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only did the findings show that there low numbers of &lt;a href="https://www.discoverwildlife.com/animal-facts/do-wild-animals-get-cancer"&gt;cancer cases&lt;/a&gt; among turtles, but when tumours did appear, they almost never spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p purpleid="8dbc1bd1-383f-47b4-87d2-41bbdc7aaecb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;So why are turtles resistant to developing cancer?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers attributed turtles’ resistance to cancer to their strong defences against cell damage, slow metabolism that reduces cellular stress and unique genes that protect against cancer. Turtles could therefore offer insightful clues for preventing or treating cancer in humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Ylenia Chiari said: “Turtles, especially iconic species like &lt;a href="https://www.discoverwildlife.com/animal-facts/reptiles/galapagos-giant-tortoise-guide-species-facts-where-they-live-what-they-eat-and-why-they-are-endangered"&gt;Galápagos&lt;/a&gt; and Aldabra giant tortoises, are famous for living long lives and growing to tremendous sizes. You’d expect that to mean more cancer, but our study, which combines decades of zoo records with previous research, shows how incredibly rare cancer is in these animals. It highlights turtles as an untapped model for understanding cancer resistance and healthy aging.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Peto’s paradox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research comes after &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2422861122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;a study from the University of Reading&lt;/a&gt;, which disputed the decades-long puzzle of Peto’s paradox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A famous study in 1977, later named Peto’s paradox, suggested that there was no link between an animal’s size and its chances of developing cancer – despite previously accepted ideas that the bigger an animal was, the greater its chances of developing cancer, since more cells meant more opportunities for mutation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But studies have slowly been challenging this longstanding hypothesis, including the aforementioned one from the University of Reading. It found that larger animals consistently showed a higher prevalence of benign and malignant tumours, and that species which evolved to be larger more rapidly (such as &lt;a href="https://www.discoverwildlife.com/animal-facts/mammals/facts-about-elephants"&gt;elephants&lt;/a&gt;) developed better natural defences against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the study didn't include &lt;em&gt;Testudines &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.discoverwildlife.com/animal-facts/amphibians/amphibian-vs-reptile-whats-the-difference"&gt;reptiles&lt;/a&gt; (the genus to which turtles belong), the low cancer rates demonstrated in species such as Galapagos and Aldabra giant tortoises, which can grow to large sizes and live beyond 150 years, are further evidence to the contrary of Peto’s paradox.&lt;/p&gt;

An increased risk of early-onset gastrointestinal cancers is associated with obesity, which is also rising in the U.S. That’s what scientists say is a “leading theory” for the surge - noting a 2019 study that found women who were considered obese had nearly double the risk of developing early-onset colorectal cancer. Close to half of all U.S. adults are predicted to be obese by 2030, according to &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/half-of-us-to-have-obesity-by-2030/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research released the same year.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;research released the same year.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The chronic condition can cause inflammation and higher levels of insulin that increases peoples’ risk of getting cancer, including several types of gastrointestinal cancers, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/risk-factors/obesity.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.
