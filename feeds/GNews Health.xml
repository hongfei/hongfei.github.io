&lt;p&gt;If this inspires you to curb your drinking, there’s a variety of directions to take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, if you suspect you have alcohol use disorder, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcohol-use-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20369243" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7941958" data-affiliate="true"&gt;talk to your doctor&lt;/a&gt; or a mental health professional who is trained in substance use. &lt;a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7941958" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt; maintains a database of mental health professionals nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are looking to cut back or cut out drinking, the experts who spoke to HuffPost gave a few tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you normally have three drinks on a Saturday, have two, Martinez said. Or, if you drink every night of the week, reduce the number of nights you do drink, Martinez suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They might want to have more days where they just don’t drink at all ... and having no alcohol days is a good thing,” Martinez added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your drink’s percentage or Alcohol By Volume (ABV) number is also an important factor. “It’s not just how much you drink, it’s ... how much alcohol is in it,” said Martinez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many craft breweries make high-percentage IPAs, which are often 8% or even 9% alcohol, much more than what’s considered to be a standard drink, which is a 12-ounce 5% beer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you drink one high ABV beer, you’re having the equivalent of one and a half standard drinks. If you have two high ABV beers, it’s the same as having three standard drinks, Martinez said. “Having lower ABV beverages can also be a way to cut down. You just want to reduce the amount of pure alcohol that you’re getting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also a wide variety of non-alcoholic beers, wines, and &lt;a href="https://tasty.co/article/hannahloewentheil/best-mocktails" data-skimlinks-tracking="7941958"&gt;mocktails&lt;/a&gt; available at many stores, restaurants, and bars. Instead of drinking booze, you can opt for a non-alcoholic option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scheller also recommended listening to podcasts like &lt;a href="https://www.soberpowered.com/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7941958" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Sober Powered&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://hellosomedaycoaching.com/podcast/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7941958" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Hello Someday&lt;/a&gt; and reading books like “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1912023385?tag=buzz0f-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=7941958%2C1%2C10%2Cmobile_web%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%3A0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7941958" data-affiliate="true"&gt;The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober&lt;/a&gt;” for support and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

But scans revealed potential complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her babies were growing but not moving in utero. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was not happy. I was sick most of the time. I was crying and stressed," Sam said of her third trimester. "We had no clue what was going on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It only became clear when the girls were born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO | &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/arc-seattle/seattle-childrens-hosptial-leads-global-breakthrough-in-childhood-cancer-treatment-b-all-leukemia-clinical-trial" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/arc-seattle/seattle-childrens-hosptial-leads-global-breakthrough-in-childhood-cancer-treatment-b-all-leukemia-clinical-trial" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Seattle Children's Hospital leads global breakthrough in childhood cancer treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All the doctors, they ran to a corner, and everyone was so shocked in that room," Sam said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El and Ally were conjoined - attached at the pelvis.  Medical staff whisked them away before Sam could see or hold them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She described being in shock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was not able to accept it suddenly when this happened," Sam said. "But then I came to my senses, like, you know, where are my kids?  I want to see them. " &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She went to visit her girls in the NICU. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've never seen conjoined twins before, but they were looking so beautiful, so incredible," Sam said. "I started crying, and I was so happy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was daunting, overwhelming, and medically challenging, but Sam was happy because El and Ally were so happy. They were joyful babies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But their parents believed their best life would come through a separation surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For my kids, I was really concerned about their growth, about their life," Sam said. "We were not able to go outside. If we go outside, it was so hard to explain to people around us.  It was so hard to keep our privacy. Everybody wanted to take pictures, to ask questions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were health issues as well.  If one of the girls was so sick she had to be hospitalized, the other did too. If one was awake, the other twin couldn't sleep. And their parents knew, as they got older, they would want to be able to walk, run, and play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family was living in the Middle East, and Sam searched the world for the best doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just took my laptop, and I started looking for all the hospitals, articles, and research papers," Sam said. "How many conjoined twins are there in the world? What kind of conjoined twins exist?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family moved to Seattle, and within days, Sam wheeled the girls into Seattle Children's Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You know, it's not often we get these patients dropping into our clinic in this way," &lt;a href="https://www.seattlechildrens.org/directory/caitlin-smith/" target="_blank" title="https://www.seattlechildrens.org/directory/caitlin-smith/" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Dr. Caitlin A. Smith&lt;/a&gt; said.  Smith is the co-director of the Reconstructive Pelvic Medicine Program at Seattle Children's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I obviously knew there was going to be a lot of work involved to evaluate them and make sure that we could separate them," Smith said.  "A lot of conjoined twins have organs or blood supply that cannot be separated. It's not safe. One of them won't be able to survive being separated because of their anatomy.  We needed to establish that their pelvic organs could be separated safely. And each of them has, you know, bladder, bowel, and gynecologic function. And so that was the main question."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEE ALSO | &lt;a href="https://komonews.com/news/helping-kids-in-crisis/seattle-childrens-hospital-opens-first-mental-health-urgent-care-clinic-washington-dr-jeff-sperring-childrens-magnuson-clinic-families-resources-services-crisis" target="_blank" title="https://komonews.com/news/helping-kids-in-crisis/seattle-childrens-hospital-opens-first-mental-health-urgent-care-clinic-washington-dr-jeff-sperring-childrens-magnuson-clinic-families-resources-services-crisis" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;Seattle Children's Hospital opens first mental health pediatric urgent care clinic in WA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children's assembled a team including urologists, gynecologists, plastic surgeons, and neurosurgeons.  "The team was ultimately about 30 people," Smith said. Counting our anesthesia team, our nursing staff.  We had great scrub techs and circulators in the OR that day that we're lucky to work with."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of six months, they met monthly to plan. They ran a practice session. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And finally, when the girls were 15 months old, they went into the operating room for an 18-hour surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think about surgery all the time, and we have very focused plans. Patients are very complex, but I've never thought about an operation for six months before," Smith said. "The relief, I think, that they were separated safely was really rewarding for me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, months later, El and Ally are quickly learning to use their new mobility.  Sarah Lewis and Maya King are physical therapists at Seattle Children's, working with the girls since they were discharged from the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Since we've seen them, they've been able to pull themselves up into standing positions and work on standing for the first time," Lewis said.  "We try to make it fun for them, to entice them to do what we're trying to get them to do. So what we're working on is some sitting to standing so that they build strength in their leg muscles and prepare their hip muscles for standing and walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another piece of their development is more emotional.  For more than a year, the twins only knew life together - then one day woke up to this dramatic change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They were smiling and they were also confused, like 'What's going on and why is she in another crib?" Sam said of the girls' post-operation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They have different personalities, different likes and dislikes. But there's some way they're still connected with their emotions. They start noticing, 'Where's my sister and why am I here alone,' so I think they always want to be together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can be together, but now it's by choice. And Sam has something she initially missed out on as a new mom. When the girls were conjoined, it was very difficult just to hold them. Now, she can finally get her cuddles. "I'm hugging them, and I'm kissing them every time," Sam said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite all their progress, El and Ally have a long road ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They still have a lot of appointments with the kidney doctors, with urology, with the plastic surgeons, and the developmental doctors.  Also, the therapies. They are getting all the therapies like feeding, speech therapy, and physiotherapy.  So we still have a lot of appointments going on, we have future surgeries," Sam said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The family established a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-conjoined-twins-thrive-and-heal?attribution_id=sl:c1411812-1bec-4f14-99a4-5f1b119cfa0e&amp;amp;utm_campaign=natman_sharesheet_dash&amp;amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;amp;utm_source=email" target="_blank" title="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-conjoined-twins-thrive-and-heal?attribution_id=sl:c1411812-1bec-4f14-99a4-5f1b119cfa0e&amp;amp;utm_campaign=natman_sharesheet_dash&amp;amp;utm_medium=customer&amp;amp;utm_source=email" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; for anyone who would like to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>KOMO</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 21:40:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitAFBVV95cUxQRWVpV1ZLb0hlZWNibWFYMFlDMHpWQm0zbjdnUUE4U0kzbXFUYnAzU3c5ZGZhM2h3bDQ2eS0zMVNzR28xWFNYRXpkMFg3NXpySGk4OHk3LWd1bmNrazdsRkZxMlAzQ2R1YmlBWFRXZHpTY3JneU5MTFprcmNHRzh3RGc1WEZ5RmQxeXBVN2U5c2pTU0tXc1lBQ0VBS3BubXprMjY1NlFjU04tWDUzU2l1Q25JTmY</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，每天吃一种坚果可以降低“坏”胆固醇，改善心脏健康- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/news/eating-one-type-nut-daily-120040131.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple snack swap could deliver big health benefits, new research shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A clinical trial led by Oregon State University found that eating about two ounces of almonds a day – roughly 45 nuts – was found to lower &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/heart-health/cholesterol" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:LDL cholesterol,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;LDL cholesterol,&lt;/a&gt; the "bad" type that clogs arteries and also offer other surprising perks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in July in Nutrition Research, followed 77 adults ages 35 to 60 with metabolic syndrome — a cluster of conditions that increase the risk of heart disease, &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/health/diabetes" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:type 2 diabetes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt; and stroke and affect roughly one-third of U.S. adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/high-potassium-foods-significantly-lower-risk-heart-failure-study-finds" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:High-potassium Foods Could 'Significantly' Lower Risk Of Heart Failure, Study Finds;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;High-potassium Foods Could 'Significantly' Lower Risk Of Heart Failure, Study Finds&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants ate either 320 calories of almonds or the same calories in crackers for 12 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Crackers were chosen as the control snack because they are commonly &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:consumed foods;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;consumed foods&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. that have similar calories but lack many of the beneficial compounds found in nuts," said lead author Laura M.

It also opens the door to more effective and accessible liver cancer treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Using common chemicals, scientists can now produce potent cancer-fighting molecules originally found in guava plants&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver cancer deaths among women plummeted through much of the 20th century, but have steadily ticked up to 5.3 deaths per 100,000 cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In men, deaths have remained high since then, reaching 10.1 deaths per 100,000 people with the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The naturally occurring molecule that the University of Delaware chemists synthesized is called (-)-psiguadial A, which has demonstrated a potent ability to stop the growth and division of liver cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists, led by Dr Chain, started by building a key - and complex - component of the cancer-fighting molecule found in the guava plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Creating the correct 3D shape of the component was crucial because the molecule only works if its shape is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once created, they attached it to another key part of the molecule. This was a major hurdle in the research because the specific spots they had to connect were buried and crowded by other atoms, making it difficult to form a new bond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Finally, the researchers used a chemical to cause a reaction that made the molecule curl around and connect to itself, forming a special ring-shaped structure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ring is the unique, central part of the natural medicine that gives it its power to fight cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A large number of our medicines, including everyday pills and powerful prescriptions, were first discovered in natural sources including fruits (stock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers said that while they have achieved a crucial first step by creating this molecule in the lab, this is just the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exact mechanism that allows (-)-psiguadial A to kill cancer cells is still under investigation and the researchers still do not fully understand it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers used measurements of (-)-psiguadial A potency taken from experiments on human liver cancer cells grown in petri dishes. Previous studies on the compound have also used animal cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Extracts containing these compounds were tested in samples in lab petri dishes against a broad panel of nine other human cancer lines, including breast, lung, prostate, and ovarian cancers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the compound itself has not yet been tested in human patients, though the successful synthesis is the first step. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While still years away from human use, their breakthrough paves the way for developing a potential new class of targeted therapies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The ultimate goal is to create a treatment that is more precise and has fewer harsh side effects than traditional chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liam O'Grady, doctoral student in Chain's lab and the article's first author, said: ‘We are the first ones to pave that road, and other people can repave it any which way. Find the shortcuts if they have to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above graph shows cases of liver cancer in women are rising, driven by a rise in obesity, diabetes, and fatty liver disease, as well as ongoing issues with alcohol and Hepatitis C&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Liver cancer cases in men are falling, which could be linked to overall lower smoking rates and widespread hepatitis B vaccinations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘But since we entered into that unknown territory, I think we helped shed light on this unknown pathway that can get us there. And I think that's the cool part.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They now need experts from various fields to help them study, improve, and ultimately determine if it can become a viable medicine for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research has zeroed in on the anti-cancer benefits of the guava plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023, an international cadre of researchers &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9963020/#:~:text=Recently%2C%20the%20World%20Health%20Organization,cytotoxicity%20towards%20cancer%20cell%20lines."&gt;reported &lt;/a&gt;that a concentrated extract made from guava leaves dramatically slowed down the unchecked growth of liver cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The higher the dose they used, the more cancer cells died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the most potent dose, it stopped over two-thirds of the cancer cells from growing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead of just poisoning the cells, the extract triggered the cells' built-in self-destruct program, a process called apoptosis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It caused a dangerous build-up of toxic waste and shut down the cells' power supply, leading to their collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver cancer is a fast-growing cancer with few highly effective treatment options, which place a multi-billion-dollar financial strain on the US healthcare system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition, the prognosis for advanced liver cancer is dire, with fewer than 15 out of every 100 patients surviving past five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The research team has partnered with the National Cancer Institute to test the guava-derived molecule against other types of cancer and to develop it further into a potential treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 20:21:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilAFBVV95cUxOWkZNbEhmMUNncnYyNGlieGsxc25uQ2UzaWloNG5wUDd3a2g1RjMyNFl3VnJBRGpRX1VVT0ZKOGFLdkxUS2NKT0sta2RFMkE1TkdHdmRETFgxZS1IR0tQUkJMdmxBMWptaTRPSWRqUi1BNEowc0ZLNExkb1lSQ0dFLUV1MkhXUFcydU9OZUk3OGJRVzA30gGaAUFVX3lxTFA5WmlmUDdwQy1VejJ3cFJrRHRJclNSVXY3Q0N3LTVOQ1EyRnN6SGxuZkdVaWdvU1BHVDV2eEwwY0hPelJjQkVNcHZYOFUwOTBwNHBPd3JURmN3Q29VaEpQdEtPNTZDTGFXU3V2OUtBM1VJbC1xTDBOemt2aGFiTE5aUVN2Ukt1QXhpek1sYU8waFg3RTRYbWdqTWc</guid></item><item><title>Ozempic诉讼：关于最新的视力丧失指控，您需要了解的一切-无聊的熊猫</title><link>https://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If there were a “drug of the summer” award, Ozempic would win hands down. This Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, scientifically known as Semaglutide, was originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes. Today, it’s better known for delivering rapid, dramatic weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ozempic’s meteoric rise has brought increased scrutiny. Its manufacturer, Novo Nordisk, now faces a flood of lawsuits. Patients are alleging a wide range of side effects, from digestive issues to the more alarming claim of irreversible vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Ozempic remains a focal point of ongoing medical research and cultural conversation, these lawsuits have placed the drug at the heart of a high-stakes legal battle. Here’s what you need to know about the controversy that’s reshaping public perception and corporate accountability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Inside the Newest Wave of Ozempic Lawsuit Filings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Person in a blue shirt using a medical device on their abdomen related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="GettyImages-2189925153-68c3c960e3029__880" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?image_id=GettyImages-2189925153-68c3c960e3029__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Ozempic Lawsuit: Everything You Need To Know About The Latest Vision Loss Allegations" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?media_id=GettyImages-2189925153-68c3c960e3029__880" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2189925153-68c3c960e3029__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2189925153-68c3c960e3029__880.jpg" alt="Person in a blue shirt using a medical device on their abdomen related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss allegations." title="Person in a blue shirt using a medical device on their abdomen related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss allegations." loading="lazy"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/self-injection-with-semaglutide-for-obesity-royalty-free-image/2189925153?phrase=ozempic&amp;amp;adppopup=true" target="_blank" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Tatsiana Volkava / Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-tablet-ad-within-content post-ads"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad" data-source="primis"&gt;&lt;span id="desktop-widget-loaded"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk is facing a rapidly escalating legal crisis, with thousands of individual lawsuits filed just this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mass tort litigation, similar lawsuits are often consolidated into a Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) to streamline the legal process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.lawsuit-information-center.com/ozempic-gastroparesis-lawsuit.html" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Lawsuit Information Centre&lt;/a&gt; reports that MDL 3094 was created in February 2024 by the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to handle the growing number of Ozempic-related cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This MDL also includes other semaglutide drugs like Wegovy and Rybelsus, along with Mounjaro, a dual GLP-1/GIP agonist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of its creation, the MDL contained just 55 cases. By August 2024, that figure jumped to 346. As of August 2025, there are 2,190 active cases, with plaintiffs claiming Novo Nordisk failed to adequately warn them about severe side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Vision Loss Is the Flashpoint in the Ozempic Lawsuit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drugwatch.com/legal/ozempic-lawsuit/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Drug Watch&lt;/a&gt; reports that most Ozempic lawsuits initially centered around gastroparesis, bowel obstruction, and cyclical vomiting syndrome. But over time, a growing number of users of Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus began reporting a rare eye condition called Non-Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A July 2024 study published in the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2820255" class=" staff-link"&gt;Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Ophthalmology&lt;/a&gt; found a link between Ozempic use and NAION. Novo Nordisk has argued that many of the diabetic patients involved already faced a heightened risk of vision problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in February 2025, a follow-up cohort study in the same journal showed a clearer increase in NAION risk among semaglutide users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June 2025, twenty-one NAION plaintiffs moved to consolidate their cases in New Jersey state court. This was notable not only because of the severity of the vision claims, but also because Novo Nordisk’s U.S. headquarters is located in Plainsboro, New Jersey. Plaintiffs aimed to challenge the company directly on its home turf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This shift in focus from stomach issues to vision loss has changed the tone of the lawsuits entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While gastrointestinal side effects can be managed over time, they rarely result in lasting disability (per &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15522-gastroparesis" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt;). NAION, on the other hand, can lead to sudden, irreversible optic nerve damage and permanent vision loss, as reported by the &lt;a class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;American Academy of Ophthalmology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs suffering from vision loss often face total blindness or an inability to live independently. This makes their stories far more powerful to juries and increases the chances of large verdicts or punitive settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What began as a product liability case is now a broader question of public health and corporate responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Patients Are Saying&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozempic prescription pen box on countertop showing medication details related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3c9bb7d942-jpeg__880" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?image_id=Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3c9bb7d942-jpeg__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Ozempic Lawsuit: Everything You Need To Know About The Latest Vision Loss Allegations" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?media_id=Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3c9bb7d942-jpeg__880" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3c9bb7d942-jpeg__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3c9bb7d942-jpeg__880.jpg" alt="Ozempic prescription pen box on countertop showing medication details related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss claims." title="Ozempic prescription pen box on countertop showing medication details related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss claims." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1e5gj8k/help_im_confused_about_the_ozempic_pen_i_have/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;r/Ozempic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the clinical terms and legal jargon, it’s the personal stories that are shaping the Ozempic lawsuits. Some complaints include harrowing details of vision loss that paint a picture of suffering, corporate failure, and Big Pharma profit over patient safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_middle_0" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One such story comes from James Norris, a mechanic in his late fifties who was prescribed Mounjaro for weight loss. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/lawsuit-alleges-man-diabetes-became-blind-taking-ozempic-rcna202959" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;NBC News&lt;/a&gt; reports that Norris was later diagnosed with NAION after his dosage was increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another is Cheryl Bovee, a 56-year-old retail worker from North Carolina. She went legally blind after using Ozempic for her diabetes. In a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/03/08/health/people-going-blind-after-using-weight-loss-drugs-like-ozempic-and-mounjaro/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt; interview, she said, “I no longer have the hope of seeing my grandchildren. I no longer have the hope of seeing their faces clearly. I can’t have any sort of independence…All of my hopes and dreams have been dashed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These firsthand accounts are a stark contrast to the glowing celebrity endorsements and social media hype that promoted Ozempic as a miracle weight loss drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DNnxUpiuZVs/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits have sparked widespread discussion on forums. A &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1fkmk9l/had_to_stop_ozempic_due_to_eye_issues/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; user said they had to stop using Ozempic due to temporary vision loss. Another shared that their vision became blurry for weeks after a dosage increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These firsthand accounts are now key in the broader legal and public debate, giving a human face to claims that might otherwise be buried in data and court filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is There a Link Between Ozempic and Irreversible Vision Loss?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;While Ozempic has been linked to vision loss through multiple studies and regulatory reviews, a direct causal relationship remains unproven. Research shows an elevated risk of developing Non-Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION) among users, but it’s still unclear whether the drug itself causes the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Semaglutide mimics the GLP-1 hormone, which promotes feelings of fullness and triggers insulin release to regulate blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/news/can-ozempic-affect-eye-health-here-s-what-ophthalm" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;American Academy of Ophthalmologists&lt;/a&gt; explains that Ozempic may lead to sharp changes in blood sugar, which can alter the shape of the eye’s lens and cause temporary vision issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another theory suggests that semaglutide reduces blood flow to the optic nerve, possibly triggering NAION and resulting in permanent vision damage. This condition is often called a “stroke of the optic nerve” (via &lt;a class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Eye Physicians of Long Beach&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complicating matters is the fact that diabetic patients are already at risk for NAION and other eye issues, making it challenging to isolate Ozempic as the direct cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a 2024 &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2820255" class=" staff-link"&gt;JAMA Ophthalmology&lt;/a&gt; study found that diabetic patients on semaglutide were over four times more likely to develop NAION than those on alternative treatments. The risk was even greater among overweight users, a key demographic for Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Person with red nail polish standing on a scale measuring weight, related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce18917eb__880" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?image_id=Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce18917eb__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Ozempic Lawsuit: Everything You Need To Know About The Latest Vision Loss Allegations" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?media_id=Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce18917eb__880" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce18917eb__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce18917eb__880.jpg" alt="Person with red nail polish standing on a scale measuring weight, related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss concerns." title="Person with red nail polish standing on a scale measuring weight, related to Ozempic lawsuit and vision loss concerns." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/an-anonymous-woman-on-the-scales-before-her-weight-loss-news-photo/141598984?adppopup=true" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Tina Stallard / Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the authors emphasized that the data showed correlation, not causation, their work supported early plaintiff claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_middle_1" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A follow-up study in 2025 echoed these findings, noting an uptick in vision-related complications among Ozempic users, even those without prior eye problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then in August 2025, the &lt;a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/prac-concludes-eye-condition-naion-very-rare-side-effect-semaglutide-medicines-ozempic-rybelsus-wegovy" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;European Medicines Agency&lt;/a&gt; officially listed NAION as a “very rare” side effect of semaglutide. According to the agency, it may affect up to 1 in 10,000 users after a year on the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a regulatory body confirms what plaintiffs are alleging, it significantly strengthens their case. The EMA also urged patients to seek medical attention immediately if they notice sudden vision changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical experts caution that more research is needed before drawing definitive conclusions. However, with growing evidence and regulatory acknowledgment, there is already considerable support for the ongoing mass tort litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How the Legal Battle Is Evolving&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;Most Ozempic-related cases fall under &lt;a href="https://www.paed.uscourts.gov/mdl/mdl-3094-re-glucagon-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-glp-1-ras-products-liability-litigation" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;MDL 3094&lt;/a&gt;, a multidistrict litigation focused on GLP-1 agonists. The core allegation is that Novo Nordisk failed to warn doctors and patients about the drug’s severe risks, including permanent vision loss and stomach paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response, Novo Nordisk is expected to invoke long-standing legal doctrines that often shield pharmaceutical companies. One is the “learned intermediary doctrine,” which holds that the company’s duty is fulfilled once it warns the prescribing physician. The burden then shifts to the doctor to relay those risks to the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another likely defense is preemption. The &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/preemption" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cornell Law School Legal Information Institute&lt;/a&gt; explains this as the idea that federal law, like the FDA’s approval process, can override state-level failure-to-warn claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Law firms like Morgan &amp;amp; Morgan, Motley Rice, and Seeger Weiss are leading the charge for plaintiffs. Each firm has a seat on the Plaintiffs’ Leadership Committee and is responsible for proving injury and showing Novo Nordisk knowingly withheld crucial safety information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the MDL, some of the most serious NAION cases have been filed in &lt;a href="https://www.njcourts.gov/notices/notice-multicounty-litigation-application-new-jersey-state-court-litigation-alleging-use-of" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;New Jersey state court&lt;/a&gt;, where Novo Nordisk is headquartered. This legal strategy could invoke state consumer protection laws and create a more favorable path for plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All signs point to a long, high-stakes legal showdown that could reshape pharmaceutical accountability rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Are the Stakes?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk faces more than mounting legal fees. Its reputation and financial future may be on the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early projections from &lt;a href="https://www.business-standard.com/health/ozempic-lawsuits-weight-loss-side-effects-stomach-paralysis-vision-loss-125081900853_1.html" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Business Standard&lt;/a&gt; estimate that total payouts from the Ozempic lawsuits could exceed $2 billion. This figure factors in the severity of the injuries, long-term medical costs, lost income, and damages for pain and suffering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The introduction of permanent vision loss into the litigation significantly raises the stakes. These NAION cases are now expected to serve as “bellwether” trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://clp.law.stanford.edu/bellwether-trials/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Stanford University &lt;/a&gt;explains, bellwether trials are early cases used to gauge how juries might respond to evidence and arguments. A single major verdict favoring a NAION plaintiff could sharply increase Novo Nordisk’s overall liability and shape the size of future settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, the outcome of these early NAION cases could determine the trajectory of the entire litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pharmaceutical Industry Is Responding to Mounting Pressure&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facing billions in potential liability, Novo Nordisk is rolling out a multifaceted strategy to defend itself. The company continues to deny any wrongdoing, maintaining that its GLP-1 drugs are safe when used as prescribed and already carry adequate warnings for known side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novo Nordisk has also launched a quiet media push. &lt;a href="https://www.business-standard.com/health/ozempic-lawsuits-weight-loss-side-effects-stomach-paralysis-vision-loss-125081900853_1.html" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Business Standard&lt;/a&gt; reports the company is emphasizing that the off-label weight loss boom was driven by social media, exposing users to risks not accounted for in the drug’s intended use. In other words, many injuries may stem from misuse, not manufacturer failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.novonordisk.com/sustainable-business/esg-portal/principles-positions-and-policies/illicit-compounding-position.html" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Novo Nordisk&lt;/a&gt; is cracking down on compounding pharmacies and telehealth clinics that sell unauthorized versions of its medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="post-desktop-ad-within-content post-ads margin-left"&gt;&lt;span class="dfp-ad"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span class="pg-ad-label"&gt;ADVERTISEMENT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="boredpandacom_singlepost_low_infinite_0" align="center" data-freestar-ad="__728x90"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/novo-nordisk-files-14-lawsuits-unapproved-semaglutide-drugs/" class=" staff-link" rel="nofollow"&gt;Pharmaceutical Technology&lt;/a&gt;, the company has filed over 132 lawsuits across 40 states and secured at least 44 permanent injunctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="video-container"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These legal moves serve two goals: tackling a public health risk and casting the company as a defender of drug safety. Novo Nordisk has also ramped public education efforts to warn against unsafe compounded products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether, these actions suggest the company may argue that any harm plaintiffs suffered came not from its FDA-approved drugs, but from unregulated alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Broader Conversation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-pm-slice="1 1 []"&gt;Ozempic’s transformation from a niche diabetes treatment to a cultural phenomenon has sparked wider debates about beauty standards, off-label drug use, and pharmaceutical ethics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before and after weight loss comparison image related to Ozempic lawsuit vision loss allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="attachment-link-container shareable-image-block" id="Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce7033a4d__880" data-href="http://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?image_id=Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce7033a4d__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;a class="web-share-button list-item-share new-share-experiment" data-location="single-post-image" data-title="Ozempic Lawsuit: Everything You Need To Know About The Latest Vision Loss Allegations" data-share-url="https://www.boredpanda.com/ozempic-lawsuit/?media_id=Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce7033a4d__880" data-image="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce7033a4d__880.jpg"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;svg class="svg-icon icon-share-icon" role="img" viewbox="0 0 16 16"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Share icon&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d="M0 15C0 10.8824 5.22292 10.0588 8.79817 10.0588V14.1765L15.7006 8.23061C15.7941 8.15345 15.8695 8.05559 15.9213 7.94441C15.9731 7.83323 16 7.71155 16 7.58824C16 7.46492 15.9731 7.34314 15.9213 7.23196C15.8695 7.12078 15.7941 7.02302 15.7006 6.94586L8.79817 1V5.11765C2.3995 5.11765 0 9.76235 0 15Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Ozempic-Lawsuit-Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-The-Latest-Vision-Loss-Allegations-68c3ce7033a4d__880.jpg" alt="Before and after weight loss comparison image related to Ozempic lawsuit vision loss allegations." title="Before and after weight loss comparison image related to Ozempic lawsuit vision loss allegations." loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="post-content-media-source"&gt;Image credits: &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/progresspics/comments/yeythw/f3952_195155140_lbs_cico_and_ozempic_no_exercise/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;r/progresspics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug’s popularity exploded as influencers and celebrities flooded social media with dramatic before-and-after shots, often touting effortless weight loss without the need for exercise or diet changes. &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/celebrities-before-and-after-ozempic/" class=" staff-link"&gt;Celebrity transformations&lt;/a&gt; helped feed the frenzy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This viral demand extended far beyond Ozempic’s approved use, exposing a wider and more diverse population to potential side effects and setting the stage for today’s lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise of Ozempic also fits into a larger shift around injectables and cosmetic trends, including procedures like the &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/lip-flip-before-and-after/" class=" staff-link"&gt;lip flip&lt;/a&gt; and transformations seen in figures like &lt;a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/kimberly-guilfoyle-before-and-after/" class=" staff-link"&gt;Kimberly Guilfoyle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, weight loss isn’t just aesthetic.

CCDPH is working to identify and notify people who may have been exposed, in collaboration with Illinois Department of Public Health. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The point of public exposure occurred Thursday, Sept. 11, in Terminal 5 at O’Hare International Airport, between the hours of 7:30 to 11 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="ContentBlocks_CardDetail__SubscribeBlock__4zBcQ ContentBlocks_CardDetail__SubscribeBlock--mobile__18tT_"&gt;&lt;section class="styles_SubscribeForm__0dj5n"&gt;&lt;h2 class="styles_SubscribeForm__title__F_olP"&gt;Find out what's happening in Oak Lawn&lt;span class="styles_SubscribeForm__title--nextLine__FTO3K"&gt;for free with the latest updates from Patch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For People Who May Have Been Exposed:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who may have been exposed should check with their health care provider if they are unsure about prior vaccination. The health care provider will determine the need for testing if symptoms develop. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If an exposed person develops symptoms, they should call a healthcare provider before going to a medical office or emergency department for evaluation to ensure that special arrangement can be made to prevent patients and medical staff from possible exposure. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People that are unvaccinated against measles, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;mumps and rubella (MMR)&lt;/a&gt; and are exposed should talk with their doctor about getting MMR vaccine. It is not harmful to get MMR vaccine after being exposed to measles, mumps or rubella and doing so may prevent measles. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most people are vaccinated against measles routinely in childhood and are not at high risk. The best defense against measles is vaccination. Two doses of MMR vaccine are 97 percent effective against measles and generally provide lifelong immunity. The first dose should be given between 12-15 months of age; the second between the ages of 4-6 years old.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease that spreads easily through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. Measles is so contagious that if one person has it, 90 percent of the people close to that person who are not immune or are unvaccinated will also become infected with the measles virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="ContentBlocks_CardDetail__SubscribeBlock__4zBcQ ContentBlocks_CardDetail__SubscribeBlock--desktop__oN6vv"&gt;&lt;section class="styles_SubscribeForm__0dj5n"&gt;&lt;h2 class="styles_SubscribeForm__title__F_olP"&gt;Find out what's happening in Oak Lawn&lt;span class="styles_SubscribeForm__title--nextLine__FTO3K"&gt;for free with the latest updates from Patch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus can linger in a room for up to two hours and can be especially dangerous for babies and young children, pregnant women, and people with compromised immune systems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Dr. Kiran Joshi, chief operating officer for the CCDPH, said the case is a critical reminder for residents traveling to areas with active measles transmission to follow &lt;a href="https://links-1.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fmeasles%2Ftravel%2Findex.html/1/0100019953f5f9ef-744a4aca-3c11-4985-9b40-83a8147ed41f-000000/N3CBU6yA0gJQtMWCto4R5LPrsWbyP-pX2Pul86S-PIM=423" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; to get vaccinated with the MMR vaccine at least two weeks prior to travel. Children between the age of 6-11 months should get an early dose of the vaccine if they are planning on international travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Measles is one of the most contagious viruses we know, and it’s entirely preventable. This case is a serious reminder that vaccination is not just about individual protection, it’s a critical community responsibility,” Chicago Public Health Commissioner Dr. Simbo Ige said in a news release. “We strongly encourage all Chicagoans, especially families traveling internationally and those working in high-exposure settings, like airports, to review their vaccination records and get up to date. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Cook County Department of Public Health offers free MMR vaccines to anyone who needs them.

The rash usually begins on the face and spreads to the trunk. A person is generally contagious the four days before and four days after the onset of a rash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Complications from measles can lead to pneumonia, seizures, hearing loss, life-long brain damage and death.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where to Get Vaccinated&lt;/strong&gt;- To make an appointment for measles vaccination at a Cook County Health community health center in Chicago or suburban Cook County call 833-308-1988.&lt;br&gt;Unvaccinated individuals who do not have a healthcare provider are encouraged to contact &lt;a href="https://links-1.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fcookcountyhealth.org%2F/1/0100019953f5f9ef-744a4aca-3c11-4985-9b40-83a8147ed41f-000000/CCoJDEXA6a02ZXyVYlIzWAv0qHGn2cgpj5VL7zNBuPk=423" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Cook County Health&lt;/a&gt; at 312-864-1111 to schedule a vaccination appointment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/publichealth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Chicago Department of Public Health&lt;/a&gt; offers free MMR vaccinations for anyone who needs them, regardless of insurance status, at CDPH immunization clinics throughout the city. Walk-ins are welcome, but registration is highly encouraged. Create an account and register for an appointment at &lt;a href="http://getvaxchi.chicago.gov" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;GetVaxChicago&lt;/a&gt; or by calling the clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check Your Vaccination History&lt;/strong&gt; – The CDC recommends two doses of the MMR vaccine for lifelong protection. If unsure, you can check your vaccine history. Immunization records recorded in the Illinois immunization registry can be accessed using the Illinois Department of Public Health &lt;a href="https://links-1.govdelivery.com/CL0/https:%2F%2Fdph.illinois.gov%2Fvaxverify.html%3Futm_source=sfmc%26utm_medium=email%26utm_campaign=CDPH%2BEncourages%2BMeasles%2BVaccination%26utm_term=https%253a%252f%252fdph.illinois.gov%252fvaxverify.html%26utm_id=1333387%26sfmc_id=82407225/1/0100019953f5f9ef-744a4aca-3c11-4985-9b40-83a8147ed41f-000000/RWCQ6Bshmq_tEvoyHZmRni4KIwo5XutgmbXIAHzrpNQ=423" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Vax Verify porta&lt;/a&gt;l.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider Your Age &amp;amp; Timing&lt;/strong&gt; – If you were vaccinated before 1968, check with your healthcare provider about a revaccination. A blood test can confirm if you still have immunity. Talk to your healthcare provider if you’re unsure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assess Exposure &amp;amp; Risk&lt;/strong&gt; – If you got just one dose, have a weakened immune system, or have been exposed to an outbreak, consult a healthcare provider about immunization.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protect Yourself from Misinformation &lt;/strong&gt;- Vitamin A is not a substitute for vaccination. Vitamin A supplementation does not prevent measles infection. It can help reduce the severity of measles symptoms—particularly in malnourished children or those with vitamin A deficiency—but only after infection has occurred. According to the CDC, vitamin A may be used as part of supportive care for measles in some patients, under medical supervision. However, relying on vitamin A instead of vaccination puts individuals and communities at risk of infection, complications, and disease spread&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;People who are frequently around international travelers, such as individuals who work at airports or taxi and rideshare drivers, should also be sure to double-check their vaccination status, as their risk of exposure to measles is heightened.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="styles_HTMLContent__LDG2k SubscribeCTABlurb_SubscribeCTABlurb__M_Azu"&gt;Get more local news delivered straight to your inbox. &lt;a target="_blank" href="/illinois/oaklawn/subscribe" class=""&gt;Sign up for free Patch newsletters and alerts.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Patch</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 20:16:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>在丹麦地下室发现的具有130年历史的黄油添加剂含有19世纪90年代的细菌- IFLScience</title><link>https://www.iflscience.com/130-year-old-butter-additive-discovered-in-danish-basement-contains-bacteria-from-the-1890s-80829</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-content"&gt;&lt;p id="isPasted"&gt;In a basement in Frederiksberg, Denmark, two bottles had been collecting dust for over a century. Last year, in a stroke of luck, researchers from the University of Copenhagen stumbled upon them once more, and found a suspect white powder lurking within. This residue, they would go on to uncover, contained bacteria from the 1890s and had once-upon-a-time been used to make butter, thus opening up a window into the Scandinavian country’s dairy-making past. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="sr-only gate-screenreader--text"&gt;The rest of this article is behind a paywall. Please sign in or subscribe to access the full content.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="piano-gate" id="piano-gate"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was like opening a kind of microbiological relic. The fact that we were able to extract genetic information from bacteria used in Danish butter production 130 years ago was far more than we had dared to hope for,” Jørgen Leisner, author of a recent study presenting the findings, said in a &lt;a href="https://food.ku.dk/english/news/2025/stored-for-130-years-bottles-reveal-evidence-of-danish-butter-production-and-hygiene-practices-of-the-past/" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a peek at the bottles’ labels, Leisner and co-authors saw that they contained cultures of lactic acid bacteria – microbes that have long been used in food preservation and flavoring. To investigate further, they extracted and sequenced DNA from the samples, comparing it with databases of known bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In doing so, they discovered traces of the lactic acid bacteria &lt;em&gt;Lactococcus cremoris&lt;/em&gt;, which is still used today by Danish dairies to acidify milk and kill harmful bacteria after &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/people-are-once-again-claiming-raw-milk-is-good-for-you-heres-why-its-not-73159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;pasteurization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As well as this, the researchers identified genes in&lt;em&gt; L. cremoris&lt;/em&gt; associated with dairy adaptation, including those that contribute to buttery flavors – something the team says is interesting given the “mild flavor profile preferred in Danish butter for the English market during the 19th century”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of the 1800s, Denmark began shipping butter to England on a large scale. To ensure good hygiene in its products, milk was first pasteurized before adding bacteria – called &lt;a href="https://dairyprocessinghandbook.tetrapak.com/chapter/cultures-and-starter-manufacture" target="_blank"&gt;starter cultures&lt;/a&gt; – which ferment and convey properties of acidity, flavor, aroma, and texture while also having a preservative effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The starter culture became the key to standardized butter production. It was no longer possible for each dairy to ferment in its own way – it was necessary to ensure that the products tasted the same, regardless of where in the country the butter was made. The starter culture made the taste reproducible,” Leisner added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also found evidence of other, less savory, bacteria in the bottles: they were contaminated with &lt;em&gt;Cutibacterium acnes&lt;/em&gt; – a skin bacterium that causes acne – and potentially pathogenic bacteria, including &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/stowaway-rat-that-hopped-on-a-flight-from-miami-was-a-wake-up-call-for-global-health-80794" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Vibrio furnissii&lt;/em&gt;. Clearly, the dairy industry faced some steep production challenges in the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall, the contents of the bottles testify to the standardization of a dairy product that every farming family used to make themselves in a jar of sour milk kept close to the stove. But it also shows that hygiene conditions were still different from those we have today," co-author Nathalia Brichet explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How about some &lt;a href="https://www.iflscience.com/the-worlds-oldest-cheese-has-been-found-rubbed-on-a-bunch-of-mummies-76096" target="_blank"&gt;ancient cheese&lt;/a&gt; to go with your bygone butter?

Gardner Policy Institute at the University of Utah on Tuesday, accompanied by a panel discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The report, produced in collaboration with the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, found 70% of Utah’s maternal deaths could have been prevented. Maternal health refers to a woman’s health during pregnancy and for a period of time postpartum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The top three causes of poor outcomes are mental health conditions, substance use disorders and obesity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The report found many factors, however, that combine to contribute to those poor maternal health outcomes, including both physical and mental health — which has worsened considerably in the last decade — substance use, intimate partner violence, lack of access to maternal health care and social determinants of health like poverty, food insecurity and transportation challenges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The report said — and the panel agreed — that the share of women experiencing each risk factor for poor maternal health outcomes depends on individual situations, including how far they are from maternal health care services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In some cases, care is far away in Utah, including five counties where women must travel an hour or more to the nearest birthing hospital. And many women who are far from care are not in a financial position to take time off to travel to doctor appointments that are more readily accessible in urban areas, according to panelist Danielle Pendergrass, a nurse consultant with Eastern Utah Women’s Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;She listed income and geographic location as the two major barriers to receiving adequate prenatal and other maternity care for those in rural Utah. “It’s a great day when I only had to take a half-day off work to get to my appointment,” Pendergrass said she has been told by women making low wages in her community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The report also noted that the share of Utah women of reproductive age with physical or mental health challenges has been rising, putting more women at risk of complications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Even so, Utah fares better than the national average, with 16 cases of maternal mortality per 100,000 live births, compared to 23 per 100,000 nationally. When it comes to severe outcomes short of death, Utah averages 61 per 10,000 compared to 88 nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;According to the Utah birth certificate database in the Office of Vital Records and Statistics, there were nearly 45,000 live births in Utah in 2023, with almost 6 in 10 of the mothers residing in Salt Lake or Utah counties. Of those, just under 83% were delivered by a physician, 13% by a certified nurse midwife, not quite 4% by other midwives and 0.3% by “other.” More than 95% of those births took place in a hospital. But the report notes that seven Utah counties do not even have a birthing hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Where-are-the-risk-factors" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Where are the risk factors?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The report found that “rates of pre-pregnancy risk factors (e.g., obesity, diabetes, and hypertension) are higher in Utah’s rural counties. Over 19% of 2023 Utah births occurred in counties with a high prevalence of pre-pregnancy physical health risk factors. Sexually transmitted infections are another pre-pregnancy risk factor, with rates highest among Wasatch Front counties and San Juan County.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Poor physical health is a greater issue among Utah women in racial and ethnic minority populations and also for those with household incomes below the federal poverty line, per the report. The highest prevalence is in Piute (30.1%), Wayne (24.3%), Carbon (23.5%), Sevier (22.9%) and Emery (22.6%) counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;In Utah, the rate of poor mental health rose 18.7 percentage points in 10 years, increasing the risk of pregnancy complications. And mental health challenges are more common among Utah women than the national average. Close to 4 in 10 Utah women of childbearing age have been diagnosed with depression and 1 in 6 experience symptoms of postpartum depression. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“Data show that only 55% of Utah women with symptoms of anxiety or depression before, during or after pregnancy report asking for help from a health care provider,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;More than 43% of women ages 18-44 — the range considered of reproductive age — living below poverty experience poor mental health, compared to 34.4% living above that federal poverty line, the analysis found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Substance use not only negatively impacts outcomes for both mother and baby, but also decreases the likelihood a pregnant woman will seek prenatal care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;So does lack of health insurance, which is more likely among women in racial and ethnic minority populations than among white women. Lack of insurance is also more likely in rural counties of the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;As for intimate partner violence, during pregnancy it is linked to maternal depression, anxiety, PTSD and greater risk of maternal death. It also increases the likelihood of giving birth prematurely, low birth weight and fetal injury, per the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“But the bigger barrier is cultural,” said Kasey Shakespear, executive director of the Rural Health Association of Utah. “We (in rural communities) don’t like to ask for help. We don’t like to bother people,” he said, noting rural residents put themselves last. As for mental health, he said people are even less likely to seek care for fear of being judged harshly. It’s not just access, he said. “You don’t want people to know you struggle.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Sarah Woolsey, medical director of the Association of Utah Community Health, called telemedicine a bright spot in providing maternal health care to women who are far away from routine appointments. But she noted that the workforce also needs to be bolstered. So does the social support network. “Women do best when they have a support system,” she said, and that can be built within a community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="A-struggling-workforce" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;A struggling workforce&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Melanie Beagley, Gardner Institute senior health research analyst, said four Utah counties lack a family physician, 13 have no OB/GYN and 12 have no certified nurse midwife right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Add all those workforce shortages in maternal health — 22 of Utah’s 29 counties are deemed primary care workforce shortage areas although 77% of the mothers giving birth in 2023 resided in them — to the other care barriers and a good maternal health outcome is not necessarily a given.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The researchers found that more than a quarter of those who die in pregnancy or postpartum (28.7%) have at least one barrier to accessing care, including not enough money (23%) and access to transportation (14.9%). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Additionally, the report found no category of professional providing an aspect of maternal care that is in surplus, from physicians assistants to nurse practitioners specializing in maternal health care to doulas and community health workers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The report cites projections that Utah’s workforce will not be able to meet the coming needs for maternal health provision across multiple specialties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;It’s projected that by 2036 there will be enough certified nurse midwives in Utah, but the Beehive State will have just 72% of its needed family practice doctors and 57% of needed OB/GYNs. In 2025, Utah has enough OB/GYNs to meet about 69% of the demand.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;And those specialists won’t necessarily be located in areas that promise adequate access. Without change, unmet maternal health needs are very likely to continue, Beagley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Most rural counties will probably still have provider shortages, the report said, including in the number of midwives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Shakespear said that Wayne County, for instance, currently has none of those provider types. The health care workforce shortage in some communities goes well beyond maternal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Family physicians, who can manage uncomplicated pregnancies and a critical part of caring for people with mental health issues and chronic conditions, are predicted to be in inadequate supply as well, especially in rural counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;It’s all an issue that Ashley Moretz, deputy division director in the Utah Department of Health and Human Services, said state officials, including the governor, are taking very seriously. He said his department has been very active in trying to plug holes in maternal health care, working with partners including funding sources like the Utah Legislature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;He said one silver lining in the challenge is Utah’s culture of working together to find solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="The-study's-mechanics" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;The study’s mechanics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Data was collected at the county level from many sources, including from groups like the American Medical Association, March of Dimes, hospital websites and more. The Gardner Institute also interviewed maternal health stakeholders to gain insights, including both barriers and challenges, as well as efforts to improve maternal health outcomes in Utah. Those efforts cover a range, from improving mental and physical health care to improving access to substance use treatment. Stories were also gathered about family challenges accessing care, with a focus on population groups that face significant barriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 18:59:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuwFBVV95cUxPVTJXTGtDSGUxLXJGVjA3R0RGTTE2anZWaUJXYlJUUDNwNmpLakZXSDlBMjdtSEVGcVg5SldtMXFtOEVUWmFJQTN3MnFYQl9aT3Z6TzF3M0lka2lQZVVVdldqYVRETEpRUDRJSkExMmxiVTVvNlFnQWJ4dXRaUzluZXcyTWZHX19DcVdMdVB3R0VsNGFvSkRuc2ZTbEw4TzEzNkhGNTB2VjJ4Z05ZUjVYTk5NTkdZU09Sd3lF</guid></item><item><title>贝利在心脏病发作后的恢复中大放异彩： “对我来说最糟糕的部分是节食，试图减轻体重” - BLABBERMOUTH.NET</title><link>https://blabbermouth.net/news/blaze-bayley-on-his-post-heart-attack-recovery-the-worst-part-about-it-for-me-is-the-diet-trying-to-keep-the-weight-off</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="news-content margin__top-xlarge margin__bottom-xlarge"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new interview with &lt;b&gt;Jorge Botas&lt;/b&gt; of Portugal's &lt;a href="https://metalglobal.pt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Metal Global&lt;/a&gt;, former &lt;b&gt;IRON MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; singer &lt;b&gt;Blaze Bayley&lt;/b&gt; once again opened up about his health — two and a half years after undergoing a quadruple bypass surgery following a heart attack in March 2023. The 62-year-old singer — who fronted &lt;b&gt;MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; more than two and a half decades ago — said (as transcribed by &lt;b&gt;BLABBERMOUTH.NET&lt;/b&gt;): "Yeah. I'm so lucky, really. With heart disease, it's one of those things, it creeps up on you. You just feel a bit out of breath here, and things are a bit more of a struggle there, and you don't really start thinking too much about it, but it adds up over time and suddenly you're having a heart attack. It's, like, how did this happen?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting on his heart attack, &lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; said: "The main thing, at the hospital, I'd just got in. They put you in this amazing room where they can X-ray you and look at all these things while other people are in the room and everything, and look at all. And they're looking at it and go, 'No, it's not stents. It's gonna need surgery. No, we can't do anything for you here. Put you out on the ward. You wait for the surgeon.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had a quadruple bypass, and I've made a good recovery," he continued. "I had a little hiccup in my recovery because when I got well enough to exercise and it was safe to exercise, I had a knee injury, and that put me back about five months, really. But, yeah, apart from that, I've got my strength back now, and I've made a good recovery. They discovered that I did have an abnormal heart in that the left side was smaller and somehow it wasn't working the best. And so the right side had been taking up the strain. And they said, with the new plumbing, I might feel an advantage. And I do — compared to what I was before, I've got a lot more energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The worst part about it for me is the diet — trying to keep the weight off," &lt;b&gt;Bayley&lt;/b&gt; admitted. "I managed to lose a &lt;i&gt;lot&lt;/i&gt; of weight with changing my habits and no exercise &lt;i&gt;at all&lt;/i&gt;. I managed to lose 30 pounds with no exercise, just by eating sensible and the way that I should have been eating. Bad habits creep back, so I'm having to try again with that. But that's about it. I stopped drinking a while ago, and it was difficult in the beginning, but gradually it's less and less of a challenge over the years, and it was all right. And the diet, to try and stay healthy, it's much tougher to give up chocolate, sugar, biscuits, donuts, sausage rolls, pies — it's much tougher to give up that than to give up booze. I wasn't a raging alcoholic, but with my mental health, I'm, like, 'I've gotta stop drinking because I've drank enough. I'm old enough now. I don't really need another drink.' But then to stop eating pies and all these things — and I start feeling, 'Oh, I feel great now. My knees feel better. Everything feels better now. I've lost all this weight.' And then bit by bit, 'Oh, I'll just have that little treat.' And then, 'My God. I look just like I'm gonna have a heart attack. No!'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's the worst thing — it's the diet, man. It's tough. And the food industry and Big Pharma [large, multinational pharmaceutical companies] are absolutely complicit in making us fat and giving us heart disease and strokes. Absolutely. They can sue me. Because it's absolutely true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The healthiest time in the U.K. was in World War II when people had to have rations, so there wasn't much food," &lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; added. "[People] were [at their] healthiest — less heart attack, strokes, less illness, less obesity, less everything. And then when we had — and this is the worst thing — they say, 'Oh, the best thing since sliced bread,' is an expression. Sliced bread is the worst thing. Bread made in a factory is one of the absolute worst things for our health, and they told us, 'Oh, it's the best thing?' No, it's the worst thing. Bread should be made by bakers early in the morning, not in a factory. Anyway, that's me. I had a heart attack and I feel it's partly their fault. I didn't know white bread was poisonous."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bayley&lt;/b&gt; fronted &lt;b&gt;IRON MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; from 1994 until 1999. The two &lt;b&gt;MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; albums he appeared on, &lt;b&gt;"The X Factor"&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;"Virtual XI"&lt;/b&gt;, sold considerably less than the band's prior releases and were their lowest-charting titles in the group's home country since 1981's &lt;b&gt;"Killers"&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since leaving &lt;b&gt;IRON MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; in 1999, &lt;b&gt;Bayley&lt;/b&gt; has released a number of albums, including several under the moniker &lt;b&gt;BLAZE&lt;/b&gt; and more than a handful under his own name. He also appeared on 2012's &lt;b&gt;"Wolfsbane Saves The World"&lt;/b&gt;, the first album of new material by &lt;b&gt;WOLFSBANE&lt;/b&gt; since the group's self-titled 1994 effort, and a follow-up LP, 2022's &lt;b&gt;"Genius"&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt;'s latest studio album, &lt;b&gt;"Circle Of Stone"&lt;/b&gt;, came out in February 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, &lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; told &lt;a href="https://www.themetalvoice.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The Metal Voice&lt;/a&gt; about his heart attack: "There's so many lucky things about a terrible incident in my life. I'm at home on Saturday. On the Friday, I've just signed off on what I think is probably the final mastered mix of a new album. That's on a Friday. Here I am on a Saturday. On the Monday, I'm scheduled to go on tour in Europe to continue with &lt;b&gt;'The Man Who Would Not Die'&lt;/b&gt; tour. And there I am, and I've got chest pains, and I think, 'Oh, is this indigestion?' I'm having a heart attack. I live two minutes from the ambulance station. I'm on the phone, and apparently the paramedics, they were going on their break towards the ambulance station and they said, 'Oh, we heard that call. It's on our way. We'll take that call.' Two minutes, they're in my house. I've got wires on my chest. 'You're having a heart attack.' I live in the city, but I'm between four hospitals. In 15 minutes I'm having treatment, and they're injecting me with dye to see what the problems are and everything. So that's it. I'm safe. I'm in hospital 15 minutes later."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; continued: "They said, the paramedics, if that had been 10 minutes [later], there's no way you'd make it. So I was 10 minutes from death. I had a heart attack, not heart failure. They got to me in time. But if I'd have been somewhere else, if I'd have been in Eurotunnel, if I'd have been in a hotel room alone, or on the autobahn in Germany — anywhere, man… It's just terrifying, really, to think about where I could be. And when they said, 'Oh, you should be able to make it back,' I said, 'I've gotta get back to work. I can't leave it like this.' I've done an album called &lt;b&gt;'War Within Me'&lt;/b&gt;, and I haven't toured the whole thing. I'm thinking of my fans and everything. I thought, 'I can't leave it like this. I've still got more music to make. I've got things to say, and I don't wanna feel like I'm letting my fans down either.' So I was so focused."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bayley&lt;/b&gt; added: "It took a while — like a few weeks — before they could put me in for the surgery. It was a quadruple bypass. Basically, they cut you in half. They cut me in half, they do a load of plumbing and then they put you back together. And the guy said, 'We wired you back together with surgical steel wire.' He said, 'We've doubled wired.' I said, 'So even more metal?' Yeah, even more metal. So I've got more metal in me than a normal heart patient."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked what symptoms he experienced prior to suffering his heart attack, &lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; said: "It's different for everyone. And this is why it's so confusing. That's why I didn't know I was having a heart attack. My heart attack was a pain that starts — it's like someone sitting on your chest or being kicked by a horse in your chest in slow motion, and it goes from the front to the back and you're sweating and all of this. That's how it happened for me. That's common. The other thing that happens is, for some people — and I didn't have &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; of this — you start going numb, you start going tingly down your left arm and it spreads across you. That's another thing. And for other people, there are other symptoms. So you just don't know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding what steps other men can take toward reducing their chances of having a heart attack, &lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; said: "You've gotta try and head it off early by getting tested for your cholesterol, your triglycerides, and all of this. And just exercise is vital, and we just don't realize that. It's vital. I think chronic laziness is one of the things. You get out the van, you get on the stage, I'm active for a couple of hours, breathing all of that, hadn't been away for a while, hadn't done anything for a while. COVID, two years of not going out there all the time. And I think that a big combination of things, and some bad habits, that led up to something that was almost fatal, really."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2023, &lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; shared details of the massive outpouring of well-wishes he received after his heart attack, including messages from his former &lt;b&gt;MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; bandmates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The thing I feel most lucky about is the incredible support I've had from my fans," he told &lt;b&gt;BLABBERMOUTH.NET&lt;/b&gt;. "All over the world. My &lt;b&gt;WOLFSBANE&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Blaze Bayley&lt;/b&gt;, the &lt;b&gt;MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; fans. Everybody bought a t-shirt for a tour that was postponed. They still bought it to support me. I'm just incredibly lucky. And the letters people wrote to me. Hundreds of cards from all over the place. It's very humbling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blaze&lt;/b&gt; continued: "I've always put my whole life into music. It is my life. When people get in touch with you and say, 'I wish you well because your music has gotten me through tough times,' 'Your music meant this to me,' 'I first saw you way back when and it's been the soundtrack to my life,' it's incredible. I got a massive card from the &lt;b&gt;MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; fan club. The [&lt;b&gt;MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt;] guys all sent me a message. I'm always in touch with &lt;b&gt;Steve Harris&lt;/b&gt; [&lt;b&gt;MAIDEN&lt;/b&gt; bassist] anyway, but everyone sent messages of support."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A heart bypass surgery, or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, is used to improve blood flow to the heart. A surgeon uses blood vessels taken from another area of the body to bypass the damaged arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term quadruple bypass refers to the number of coronary arteries bypassed in the procedure. In other words, a quadruple bypass means four coronary arteries are bypassed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Oppa3umPUY?si=Vo6xbKgxndniiskb" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BLABBERMOUTH.NET</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 18:36:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4wFBVV95cUxObE9tbk44OUFVX0pvQ3VOWVQtcEFQUXoyRXhSRWlSU1pYanRCdXdXWVdnTnlZdEh5OXI1VlMzWG9UR1dFYjJxUVV0azIwcW1VVnhQU2p6ZnoxelRGZ3dxeE9SRmM5STNzSFB1SzE1Z2pCaWVXZzh4dk1PaTdRTmlKeUdnNGpyU19DQmoydS0xRXlRUW9uOFZoeU9MRU1Lb2pDdDREUnZsVGdLZ3pfV1VNTVdabXRYMmhXTFpPQWRiZy0xX190T2hMTGUybHN2eVpmSDNiWjYzMURMUHpqd3hrNGNpWQ</guid></item><item><title>饮食可以改善MS的健康标志物，但不会影响脑部病变-今日多发性硬化症新闻</title><link>https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2025/09/16/diets-improve-health-markers-ms-dont-affect-brain-lesions-study/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/relapsing-remitting-multiple-sclerosis-rrms/"&gt;relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (RRMS) who started fasting or adopted a ketogenic diet — one low in carbs and rich in fat — for 18 months showed reductions in risk factors for heart and metabolic disease that were similar to those who followed a standard healthy diet, according to data from a clinical trial conducted in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The results suggest beneficial effects of dietary interventions, underscoring their potential as a complementary strategy in the treatment of RRMS,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, sticking to these diets did not show any differences in the number of new brain &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/ms-lesions/"&gt;lesions&lt;/a&gt; among patients, which was the trial’s main goal. The diets were tied to a stable disease course, the data showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there were trends suggesting the ketogenic diet may support cognition, and fasting may ease symptoms of depression, according to the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcnutr.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40795-025-01156-5"&gt;Fasting, ketogenic, and anti-inflammatory diets in multiple sclerosis: a randomized controlled trial with 18-month follow-up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,” was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;BMC Nutrition&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While many patients are willing to incorporate dietary strategies into their care, no specific diet has yet been proven to slow disease progression in &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/multiple-sclerosis-overview/"&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt; (MS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that reason, patients are usually advised to follow broad &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/living-with-ms/ms-diet-nutrition/healthy-eating-ms/"&gt;healthy eating guidelines&lt;/a&gt; — consuming plenty of fruits and vegetables, choosing whole grains and lean proteins, and limiting processed or sugary foods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fasting diets, which involve going without eating for several hours each day, and ketogenic diets, which cut down on carbohydrates and increase fat intake, are both believed to have anti-inflammatory effects. These diets have shown promising benefits in &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2024/02/16/review-larger-ms-studies-needed-evaluate-benefit-intermittent-fasting/"&gt;easing symptoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/news-posts/2022/03/09/ketogenic-diet-eases-rrms-symptoms-aids-life-quality-rrms-small-study/"&gt;improving quality of life&lt;/a&gt; in people with MS, but the evidence so far comes mainly from small studies and hasn’t been conclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;MS patients in trial assigned to 1 of 3 diets for 18 months&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more, a group of researchers from Berlin conducted a clinical trial — enrolling 105 adults with RRMS — that compared a fasting diet against a ketogenic diet and a standard healthy diet with anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03508414"&gt;NAMS trial (NCT03508414)&lt;/a&gt;, conducted at a single site in the country’s capital city, enrolled participants with active RRMS, who could continue to receive a stable dose of their &lt;a href="https://multiplesclerosisnewstoday.com/treatments-that-modify-the-disease-course/"&gt;disease-modifying therapy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 18 months, participants were asked to follow their assigned diet and participate in 10 group sessions designed to encourage adherence, address any questions, and evaluate compliance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The standard healthy diet was based on German nutrition guidelines, encouraging mostly vegetarian meals and aiming for a healthy fat balance to help reduce inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The fasting diet included a seven-day fast every six months, plus time-restricted eating on six days per week — 14 hours fasting and 10 hours eating. Participants otherwise followed the standard diet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ketogenic diet limited carbohydrate intake to 20-40 grams per day while increasing fat consumption to about 70% to 80% of daily calories, mainly from plant-based sources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 18 months, none of the diets met the trial’s main goal of reducing the number of new brain lesions, or areas of tissue damage, the data showed. Further, no meaningful differences were seen in lesion volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the researchers noted that the lack of new lesions across all groups after 18 months represented a favorable result, especially because participants had active disease before joining the study. Nearly half of the participants, however, were on stable DMT, which may have helped suppress new disease activity, the team noted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Healthy eating lowered patient risk factors for heart, metabolic diseases&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the trial failed to meet its main goal, several secondary outcomes showed encouraging effects. For example, people on the fasting diet reported slight improvements in depressive symptoms after 18 months compared with people on the standard diet. Also, cognitive processing speed improved slightly in the fasting group and had a more noticeable increase in the ketogenic group, while remaining unchanged in the standard diet group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though in different ways, all of the diets lowered participants’ risk factors for heart and metabolic diseases. Such risk factors included body weight, body fat, certain blood fats, and blood pressure — all of which have been linked to worse disease outcomes, the researchers noted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;Overall, the findings suggest beneficial effects of dietary interventions, supporting their potential role as complementary strategies in the management of RRMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hormone levels also shifted in a healthier direction, the data showed. Leptin, usually elevated in MS and associated with more severe disability, dropped in the ketogenic group, while adiponectin, which helps protect against inflammation, rose in both the ketogenic and fasting groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No nutrient deficiencies were observed, and all diets were safe and well tolerated, with side effects mostly mild and transient. No serious health events were linked to the interventions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Overall, the findings suggest beneficial effects of dietary interventions, supporting their potential role as complementary strategies in the management of RRMS,” the researchers wrote. “These results warrant further investigation in larger and more homogeneous study populations to allow for definitive conclusions.”&lt;/p&gt;

The researchers emphasized how risk rose with more consumption across the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Demewoz-Haile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Demewoz Haile&lt;/a&gt; is a research scientist at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle (&lt;a href="https://www.healthdata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IHME&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-processed-meat-and-daily-habits"&gt;Processed meat and daily habits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts who were asked to weigh in stressed how steady habits add up over time, and they pointed to the reliability of the pattern across many datasets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Habitual consumption of even small amounts of processed meat, sugary drinks, and trans fatty acids is linked to increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/heart-attack/about-heart-attacks/silent-ischemia-and-ischemic-heart-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ischemic heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and colorectal cancer,” said Dr. Haile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another nutrition scientist urged people to limit these foods for the long haul rather than chase perfection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current research, consistent with earlier findings, indicates that the best way to improve health is to avoid or keep intake of processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages, and industrially produced trans fats as low as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-the-study-was-done"&gt;How the study was done&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used a Burden of Proof approach, a type of meta-analysis that models how risk changes across the full range of intake while grading the consistency of the evidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most associations in this paper received two stars in that framework, which the authors describe as weak but still meaningful, with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/processed-meat-can-cause-health-issues-even-in-tiny-amounts/"&gt;hot dogs&lt;/a&gt; and other processed meat and ischemic heart disease receiving one star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dose response curves rose steadily, and they rose fastest at the low end of intake. That shape helps explain why small daily portions can move risk in population studies even if the per person effect looks modest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-counts-as-processed-meat"&gt;What counts as “processed meat”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed meat includes products preserved by smoking, curing, salt, or chemical preservatives, such as hot dogs, bacon, sausages, and deli meats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed meat is classified as carcinogenic to humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (&lt;a href="https://www.iarc.who.int/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Monographs-QA_Vol114.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;IARC&lt;/a&gt;), with colorectal cancer as the main concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar sweetened beverages cover regular sodas, fruit drinks that are not 100 percent juice, energy drinks, sports drinks, and sweetened coffees and teas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 12 ounce can is a common serving, and that size showed measurable links with type 2 diabetes and ischemic heart disease in the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-these-foods-may-harm-the-body"&gt;How these foods may harm the body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processed meats often contain nitrite that can form &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/nitrosamine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nitrosamines&lt;/a&gt;, compounds that can damage cells in the digestive tract. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High heat cooking of meats can also produce polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and heterocyclic amines, which have been tied to tumor formation in prior lab and epidemiology work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sugar sweetened beverages deliver large amounts of rapidly absorbed sugar without much satiety, which drives excess calorie intake and strains insulin regulation over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industrial &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/junk-food-diet-triggers-lasting-changes-in-the-brain/"&gt;trans fatty&lt;/a&gt; acids raise LDL cholesterol and lower HDL cholesterol, a pattern known to promote plaque buildup in arteries and increase cardiovascular risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-the-evidence-shows"&gt;What the evidence shows&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Observational data cannot prove causation, and dietary questionnaires can be imprecise, so caution is warranted when interpreting the size of the effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we look at the actual data there, it’s really remarkably consistent and remarkably strong, and even in the lower dose of consumption, we can still see an increased risk of disease,” said &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/profile/mingyang-song/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Mingyang Song&lt;/a&gt;, associate professor of clinical epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (&lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;HSPH&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others reminded readers to avoid fear and to keep diet in perspective alongside activity, stress, and access to care. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The limitations of recall based diet tools and differences in study design leave some uncertainty, but none of that erases the pattern that higher intake tracks with higher disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-processed-meat-and-human-health"&gt;Processed meat and human health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global guidance suggests keeping free sugars to less than 10 percent of daily calories and ideally closer to 5 percent, and that directly targets sugar sweetened drinks, as laid out in a World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241549028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;guideline&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, the Dietary Guidelines also advise limiting added sugars to under 10 percent of calories across the life span, a point detailed in the federal &lt;a href="https://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015/resources/2015-2020_dietary_guidelines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many countries are now removing industrial trans fats from the food supply, and the World Health Organization’s &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/teams/nutrition-and-food-safety/replace-trans-fat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;REPLACE&lt;/a&gt; policy provides a template for doing it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means fewer packaged foods will contain partially hydrogenated oils, but checking labels remains wise because trace amounts can still show up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The goal shouldn’t be perfection but rather a healthy and sensible dietary pattern that allows room for enjoyment,” said &lt;a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/food/our-staff/gunter-kuhnle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Gunter Kuhnle&lt;/a&gt;, professor of nutrition and food science at the &lt;a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Reading&lt;/a&gt; in the United Kingdom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Progress does not require a perfect diet or a strict set of rules. Small, steady changes, like swapping a daily soda for water or seltzer and choosing unprocessed proteins more often, can bring intake closer to those targets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03775-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 16:24:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxNTGdPU3BfUjZFZzhXc0VMTkRlTkxKdFVVNDdVZzNVeU1WSXhpUVFkNkFaMFdObDlTeFNDTGJUUVVSWktod3FMRm1SWjNtRnNDMEJ5aWk4QUNvSmFPX0VBQ2pYelZMU09vUmlaOHdxV0gyRjlKV0d1d0VPWEd2cUpfc29VME9GazMyUkQ2eV82R3BRTDJLOFpWVWRnUjJweHBfU3dkNkZzeGRYa0dCbHYw</guid></item><item><title>什么是日本间歇步行趋势，它真的能让您更健康吗？ -每日邮报</title><link>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-15104251/What-Japanese-Interval-Walking-trend-really-make-you-fitter.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="js-article-text" class="article-text wide  heading-tag-switch"&gt;

                  &lt;noscript&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;     &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whereas once the ways of getting fit were quite straightforward – going to the gym, heading out for a run etc – nowadays there are all kinds of weird and wonderful workout ‘methods’ gaining traction on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;From &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/home/you/article-14102137/weighted-hula-hoop.html"&gt;weighted hula hoops&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a target="_self" class="class" href="/home/you/article-14559665/10-20-30-viral-exercise-hack.html"&gt;10-20-30 hack&lt;/a&gt;, the internet is constantly coming up with new ways to stay fit and healthy, and one of the recent exercise routines to trend online is called ‘Japanese Interval Walking’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you haven’t heard of it before, you are certainly not alone, but essentially it’s a form of intermittent walking developed by researchers in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/japan/index.html" id="mol-137549f0-9317-11f0-9c24-3b2c6714de30"&gt;Japan&lt;/a&gt; to improve cardiovascular fitness and your metabolism. In practise, that means repeating the following five times, for a total of 30 minutes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-italic"&gt;- Walk at a brisk pace for 3 minutes: About 70-85% of your maximum heart rate. You should be able to speak, but you may find continuous talking a challenge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold mol-style-italic"&gt;- Walk at a more leisurely pace for 3 minutes and let your heart rate come down to 40-50% of your maximum heart rate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And it’s not just an internet fad. The Japanese Walking Technique is supported by the research of Dr Hiroshi Nose published in &lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0025619611613037"&gt;Mayo Clinic Proceedings.&lt;/a&gt; Compared to continuous walking at the same pace, the researchers found that ‘High-intensity interval walking may protect against age-associated increases in blood pressure and decreases in thigh muscle strength and peak aerobic capacity.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Japanese Interval Walking is the latest TikTok fitness method&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Intermittent walking is also an easy method to try out. Jack Claxton, Personal Trainer at&lt;a class="class" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.davidlloyd.co.uk/"&gt; David Lloyd&lt;/a&gt; says ‘switching between a brisk pace and a steadier one’ when you walk ‘is a great way to get more out of something most people already do every day. It gives your heart and lungs a stronger workout, helps you burn more calories in less time, and boosts stamina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Interval training in general also makes exercise more engaging because the change of pace keeps it varied and less monotonous,’ he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But how do you know what counts as high intensity walking? Well, your maximum heart rate can be estimated by subtracting your age from 220. If you are walking with a heart rate at around three-quarters of this number, as measured on a fitness tracker (e.g. a fitness watch), then that’s a good sign, but as Claxton says ‘A simple way to measure this is the “talk test.” If you’re walking quickly enough that you’re breathing heavily and can only speak in short sentences, that’s considered high intensity for you.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Your maximum heart rate is 220 minus your age - aim to be at 70-85% of this number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are ways to achieve this other than simply walking very fast. ‘Walking uphill, or using an incline on a treadmill, is another way to increase intensity without running,’ says Claxton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although it can count as high-intensity, walking is also low impact, making it much gentler on the joints and more sustainable for most people, especially those who are older or recovering from an injury. ‘It’s also one of the most accessible forms of exercise because it requires no equipment and can easily be built into daily life,’ says Claxton. ‘On top of that, it’s a great stress reliever and often easier to stick to long term compared to more demanding workouts like running or aerobics’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Walking is brilliant for relieving stress, says Claxton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, that doesn’t necessarily mean you should ditch other forms of workout in favour of walking. ‘While walking is excellent for cardiovascular health, it doesn’t build strength or improve mobility on its own,’ says Claxton. ‘As we age, resistance training becomes crucial for maintaining bone density, reducing the risk of falls, and preserving independence in daily activities. That’s why it’s so important to combine walking with some form of strength training; even simple bodyweight exercises or light weights can make a big difference.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As for his verdict on social media fitness trends? They have pros and cons, says Claxton. ‘On the positive side, they can motivate people to try new workouts and become more active, which is always a good thing. However, not everything you see online is safe, effective, or suitable for everyone. Many of these trends are designed more to capture attention than to genuinely improve health. My advice is to use TikTok as inspiration, but rely on proper guidance from a professional for your actual training.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Newborn circumcision rates in the US fell from 54% in 2012 to 49% in 2022.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;White families saw the sharpest drop, while Black and Hispanic rates stayed steady.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Wealthier and privately insured families had higher rates but also bigger declines.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Researchers point to rising skepticism toward medicine and Hispanic population growth as possible factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BALTIMORE —&lt;/strong&gt; Circumcision among newborn boys in the United States has steadily declined over the past decade, even as leading health organizations have voiced support for the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A new analysis from researchers at Johns Hopkins University of more than 1.5 million annual hospital records shows the share of newborn boys circumcised during their first month of life fell from 54.1% in 2012 to 49.3% in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This decline came after the World Health Organization (2007), the American Academy of Pediatrics (2012), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2018) each issued &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/study-finds-circumcision-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recommendations supporting access&lt;/a&gt; to newborn circumcision. These groups highlighted research linking the procedure with lower risks of urinary tract infections, penile inflammation, and transmission of sexually transmitted infections including HIV.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-white-families-account-for-the-largest-circumcision-decline"&gt;White Families Account for the Largest Circumcision Decline&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Trends varied sharply across racial and ethnic groups. For White newborns, circumcision prevalence was 61.0% in 2012, rose to a peak of 65.3% in 2019, and then declined to 60.0% in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Black families maintained the highest rates at about 66% throughout the study period, while Hispanic families consistently had the lowest at around 21%.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regional differences were just as pronounced. Hospitals in the Midwest recorded the highest prevalence at 68.5% in 2022, while Western hospitals reported only 19.7%. Among White families in the West, circumcision dropped from 34.3% in 2012 to 26.2% in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-wealth-and-insurance-status-shape-decisions"&gt;Wealth and Insurance Status Shape Decisions&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/income/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Household income&lt;/a&gt; and insurance coverage also influenced circumcision choices. Parents in the wealthiest zip codes started with higher rates (59.4% in 2012) but saw some of the steepest declines, falling to 51.1% by 2022.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Insurance patterns told a similar story. Families with private coverage had the highest baseline prevalence, 64.2% in 2012, yet their rate fell sharply to 56.3% in 2022. Medicaid-covered families showed smaller shifts, with circumcision declining from 44.5% to 42.3% over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Policy changes may have contributed. By 2011, 17 states had ended &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/medicaid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Medicaid coverage&lt;/a&gt; for routine newborn circumcision, creating financial hurdles for some families. Still, researchers noted that cost alone cannot explain the overall decline, since reductions were also seen among privately insured families.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cultural-factors-and-changing-attitudes-towards-circumcision"&gt;Cultural Factors and Changing Attitudes Towards Circumcision&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The authors note that several factors may contribute to why parents are choosing circumcision less often despite medical endorsements. The American Academy of Pediatrics affirms that the health benefits outweigh the risks but stresses that the decision should remain &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/parenting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;with parents&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They highlight increased skepticism toward medical recommendations in the United States and the continual growth of the Hispanic population and births, given that Hispanic families have consistently low circumcision rates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2025.2464" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;JAMA Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, also found that rates among Black newborns stayed stable across regions, while White newborns showed the largest decreases. The authors did not investigate reasons for these racial differences, only documenting their persistence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-medical-guidance-meets-parental-autonomy"&gt;Medical Guidance Meets Parental Autonomy&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers relied on the Kids’ Inpatient Database, a nationally representative sample of pediatric hospitalizations. They examined circumcision procedures performed within 28 days of birth, identified through billing codes. This design captures most newborn circumcisions, though not those performed in outpatient clinics or later in infancy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Limitations include possible underreporting due to coding sensitivity, lack of state-level identifiers, and the fact that the database counts hospital discharges rather than unique infants. Still, the study represents the most comprehensive national picture available.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between 2012 and 2022, medical organizations offered some of their clearest endorsements of circumcision’s health benefits. Yet parents moved in the opposite direction, choosing the procedure less often. The gap between institutional recommendations and family decisions underscores how health behaviors reflect more than clinical guidance alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the authors concluded, circumcision trends reflect a mix of demographic change, cultural views, and shifting trust in healthcare—factors that shape decisions even when medical benefits are emphasized.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: This article is for general information only and should not be taken as medical advice. Parents should consult healthcare professionals when making decisions about circumcision or other procedures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-group has-quaternary-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained"&gt;
&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-paper-summary"&gt;Paper Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed the Kids’ Inpatient Database from 2012 to 2022, examining over 1.5 million hospital records of male newborns aged 0-28 days each year. They excluded babies with bleeding disorders, penile abnormalities, or premature births. The team used medical billing codes to identify circumcision procedures and applied statistical weights to generate national estimates. They calculated annual circumcision rates and used regression analysis to measure changes over time across different demographic groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall circumcision rates declined from 54.1% in 2012 to 49.3% in 2022. White families drove most of the decline, with rates dropping from 65.3% to 60%. Black families maintained stable rates around 66%, while Hispanic families remained at about 21%. The Midwest had the highest rates (68.5%) and the West the lowest (19.7%). Wealthier families and those with private insurance had higher circumcision rates but experienced the largest declines during the study period.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study only captured hospital-based circumcisions using billing codes, which may underestimate total circumcision rates due to coding issues or outpatient procedures. The database tracks hospital discharges rather than individual patients, so multiple hospitalizations for the same baby appear as separate records. State-level data wasn’t available, limiting analysis of policy effects. The study was restricted to the first 28 days of life, potentially missing some procedures performed later.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-funding-and-disclosures"&gt;Funding and Disclosures&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study received partial funding from a National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases grant (R01DK131926). Dr. Tobian reported receiving National Institutes of Health grants during the study. The researchers stated that funders had no role in study design, data analysis, or publication decisions. No other conflicts of interest were reported.&lt;/p&gt;

The study was conducted by researchers from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Bloomberg School of Public Health, led by Ping Yang and Dr. Aaron A.R. Tobian. The paper was accepted for publication on June 10, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

To paraphrase Hume: Just because two things happen at the same time doesn’t mean one is causing the other. Every smart person already already knows this, and it's repeated constantly, but we all still get it wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last &lt;a href="https://www.nutraingredients.com/Article/2025/07/31/correlation-dressed-up-as-causation-the-reality-of-microbiome-science/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;20 years of research on "gut biomes"&lt;/a&gt; could be wrong, partly as a result of both scientists and the media mistaking correlation and causation. (I've always had a gut feeling—get it?—this research was suspect.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years people believed that drinking alcohol in moderation is good for your health. But it isn't. It's &lt;em&gt;correlated&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9653126/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;better health in some populations&lt;/a&gt;, but it doesn't &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; better health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defenders of mistaken beliefs derived from the correlation/causation fallacy will often compile volumes of data that shows a nearly exact correlations between, say, higher rates of autism and higher rates of vaccination, which makes it totally understandable to believe one causes the other. But there's &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24814559/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;no evidence that vaccines cause autism&lt;/a&gt;, and the correlation is probably because children received vaccines around the age autism is generally diagnosed, and we've gotten better at both vaccinating children and diagnosing autism. But "probably" is doing some lifting in that sentence. While no causal link between vaccines and autism has ever been demonstrated, there could be any number of reasons the rates line up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Classic debunking examples of correlation and causation, like the link between &lt;a href="https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2025/06/17/glp-spaces-on-x-ice-cream-sales-increase-drowning-confusing-correlation-and-causation-yields-strange-and-often-harmful-results" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;ice cream sales and shark attacks&lt;/a&gt;, tend to offer a pat explanation for the causal link—it only seems like ice cream causes shark attacks because both ice cream sales and swimming in the ocean rise when the weather is warmer—but even that is potentially mistaking correlation for causation. It makes sense, but we don’t actually &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; why those two numbers line up. And sometimes there just isn't any reason for connection between two pieces of disparate information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check out the chart below. It's &lt;em&gt;proof&lt;/em&gt; that the ratings of &lt;em&gt;Two and Half Men&lt;/em&gt; directly correlates with the amount of jet fuel used in Serbia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="eloquent-imagery-image"&gt;

                    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made the second example on Tyler Vigen's &lt;a href="https://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Spurious Correlations&lt;/a&gt;, with a tool that will lets you &lt;a href="https://tylervigen.com/spurious/discover" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;make random connections all day.&lt;/a&gt; Not only that, the site uses AI to generate &lt;a href="https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious/research-papers/2700_fueling-laughter-exploring-the-comedic-connection-between-two-and-a-half-men-season-ratings-and-jet-fuel-consumption-in-serbia.pdf" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;bogus "research papers&lt;/a&gt;" to explain the connection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of the cats, ChatGPT offers this as a possible explanation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Health-conscious households (those that track diet, buy fruit, etc.) are more likely to treat even minor injuries cautiously. A person who eats more fruit is not more likely to be scratched, but they are more likely to Google 'my cat scratched me' to check for infection risks or treatment steps."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though I know it's bullshit, it &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;tracks&lt;/em&gt;. That's why we can never really stop being wrong in this specific way. Our brains &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to believe. A neatly phrased explanation, a tidy chart, a plausible-sounding theory—it's so &lt;em&gt;satisfying&lt;/em&gt;.  A simple "we don't know" can't hold a candle to that certainty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mistaking correlation for causation makes us go on fad diets and believe we're being healthy by drinking wine at dinner. It shapes health advice, public policy, and personal decisions in ways that can actually hurt people. The best we can do is try to be aware of it—when we read a headline that says "X causes Y," to assume this is a "cat scratches cause fruit consumption" situation until there's evidence that it isn't. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/article&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Cats may have a reputation for independence, but emerging research suggests we share a unique connection with them – fueled by brain chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main chemical involved is oxytocin, often called the love hormone. It's the same neurochemical that surges when a mother cradles her baby or when friends hug, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03701"&gt;fostering trust and affection&lt;/a&gt;. And now studies are showing oxytocin is important for cat-human bonding too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin plays a central role in social bonding, trust and stress regulation in many animals, including humans. One &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03701"&gt;2005 experiment&lt;/a&gt; showed that oxytocin made human volunteers significantly more willing to trust others in financial games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-a-simple-technique-to-communicate-with-your-cat"&gt;Scientists Reveal a Simple Technique to Communicate With Your Cat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174376" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174376" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/WomanScratchingClosedEyedCatsFace.jpg" alt="Scans Reveal Owning a Cat Changes Your Brain (And Theirs)" class="wp-image-174376 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/WomanScratchingClosedEyedCatsFace.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/WomanScratchingClosedEyedCatsFace-600x379.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174376" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Snuggling with a cat can help suppress the stress hormone cortisol.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;(Tatiana Lavrova/Moment/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin also has calming effects in humans and animals, as it suppresses the stress hormone cortisol and activates the &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/our-vagus-nerves-help-us-rest-digest-and-restore-can-you-really-reset-them-to-feel-better-210469"&gt;parasympathetic nervous system&lt;/a&gt; (the rest and digest system) to help the body &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/13/13/2116#:%7E:text=Two%20stress%20response%20pathways%20to,and%20these%20effects"&gt;relax&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long known that friendly interactions &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93922-1"&gt;trigger oxytocin release&lt;/a&gt; in both dogs and their owners, creating a mutual &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/your-dog-can-read-your-mind-sort-of-261720"&gt;feedback loop of bonding&lt;/a&gt;. Until recently, though, not much was known about its effect in cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cats are more subtle in showing affection. Yet their owners often report the same warm feelings of companionship and stress relief that dog owners do – and studies are increasingly backing these reports up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers in Japan, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/13/13/2116#:%7E:text=Daily%20direct%20interaction%20with%20cats,physiological%20stress%20in%20their%20owners"&gt;reported in 2021&lt;/a&gt; that brief petting sessions with their cats boosted oxytocin levels in many owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that study, women interacted with their cats for a few minutes while scientists measured the owners' hormone levels. The results suggested that friendly contact (stroking the cat, talking in a gentle tone) was linked to elevated oxytocin in the humans' saliva, compared with a quiet resting period without their cat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people find petting a purring cat is soothing, and research indicates it's not just because of the soft fur. The act of petting and even the sound of purring can trigger oxytocin release in our brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5aa6be7de17ba3f559d28f25/t/5aa85bc7e2c4839970ff3190/1520982983501/pet_paper.pdf"&gt;One 2002 study&lt;/a&gt; found this oxytocin rush from gentle cat contact helps lower cortisol (our stress hormone), which in turn can reduce blood pressure and even pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_147487" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-147487" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/GreenEyesOfCatPeakingOverFluffyObject.jpg" alt="Green cat eyes peaking over fluffy object" class="wp-image-147487 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/GreenEyesOfCatPeakingOverFluffyObject.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/GreenEyesOfCatPeakingOverFluffyObject-603x415.jpg 603w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/GreenEyesOfCatPeakingOverFluffyObject-600x413.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-147487" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/brown-tabby-cat-lying-on-white-textile-L9_6aQAUu-4"&gt;axholmephotography/Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When is oxytocin released between cats and humans?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research is pinpointing specific moments that cause the release of this hormone in our cross-species friendship. Gentle physical contact seems to be a prime trigger for cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016815912500022X"&gt;A February 2025 study &lt;/a&gt; found that when owners engaged in relaxed petting, cuddling or cradling of their cats, the owners' oxytocin tended to rise, and so did the cats' – if the interaction was not forced on the animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers monitored oxytocin in cats during 15 minutes of play and cuddling at home with their owner. Securely attached cats who initiated contact such as lap-sitting or nudging showed an oxytocin surge. The more time they spent close to their humans, the greater the boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about less-cuddly felines? The same study noted different patterns in cats with more anxious or aloof attachment styles. Avoidant cats (those who kept their distance) showed no significant oxytocin change, while cats who were anxious (constantly seeking their owner but easily overwhelmed by handling) had high oxytocin to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin of avoidant and anxious cats was found to drop after a forced cuddle. When interactions respect the cat's comfort, the oxytocin flows – but when a cat feels cornered, the bonding hormone is elusive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe humans could learn something from their feline friends on managing attachment styles. The key to bonding with a cat is understanding how they communicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike dogs, cats don't rely on prolonged eye contact to bond. Instead, they use more understated signals. The most well known is the slow blink. It's a feline smile, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73426-0"&gt;signaling safety&lt;/a&gt; and trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purring also plays a role in bonding with people. The low-frequency rumble of a cat's purr has been linked not only to healing in cats themselves, but also to &lt;a href="https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/10.1079/hai.2021.0006"&gt;calming effects in humans&lt;/a&gt;. Listening to purring can lower heart rate and blood pressure; oxytocin &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10340037/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;mediates these benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companionship of a cat, reinforced by all those &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/13/13/2116#:%7E:text=Kamimura%2C%20I,Green"&gt;little oxytocin boosts&lt;/a&gt; from daily interactions, can serve as a buffer against anxiety and  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="174360" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2752/089279393787002385"&gt;in some cases&lt;/a&gt; providing comfort on par with human social support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_115183" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-115183" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/12/BlackCatStoopedLowReadyToPounce.jpg" alt="Black cat crouching to pounce on toy" class="wp-image-115183 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/12/BlackCatStoopedLowReadyToPounce.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/12/BlackCatStoopedLowReadyToPounce-642x428.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/12/BlackCatStoopedLowReadyToPounce-623x415.jpg 623w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/12/BlackCatStoopedLowReadyToPounce-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/12/BlackCatStoopedLowReadyToPounce-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-115183" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Like dogs, many catch will play fetch. (scaliger/iStock/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are cats just less loving than dogs?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's true that studies generally find stronger oxytocin responses in dog–human interactions. In &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/research-dogs-actually-love-their-owners-more-than-cats-do/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;one widely discussed 2016 experiment&lt;/a&gt;, scientists measured oxytocin in pets and owners before and after ten minutes of play. Dogs showed an average 57 percent spike in oxytocin levels after playtime, whereas cats showed about a 12 percent increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In humans, oxytocin levels rise during meaningful social interactions. &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00532/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; show that contact with a loved one produces stronger oxytocin responses than contact with strangers. So, a happy dog greeting is akin to that rush of seeing your child or partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs, being pack animals domesticated for constant human companionship, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)00602-3"&gt;are almost hard-wired&lt;/a&gt; to seek eye contact, petting, and approval from us – behavior that stimulates oxytocin release in both parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cats, however, evolved from more &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168159124000169"&gt;solitary hunters&lt;/a&gt; which didn't need overt social gestures to survive. So, they may not display oxytocin-fueled behavior as readily or consistently. Instead, cats may reserve their oxytocin-releasing behavior for when they truly feel safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cat's trust isn't automatic; it must be earned. But once given, it is reinforced by the same chemical that bonds human parents, partners, and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, next time your cat blinks slowly from across the sofa or climbs on to your lap for a purr-filled cuddle, know that something invisible is happening too: oxytocin is rising in both your brains, deepening the trust and soothing the stress of daily life. Cats, in their own way, have tapped into the ancient biology of love.&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/264396/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"&gt;

							&lt;p&gt;There's a particular quality some older people have—a spark that makes you forget you're talking to someone who remembers when television was new. They drop perfectly timed jokes, recall obscure facts with startling clarity, and somehow manage to stay current without trying too hard. These aren't just the genetically blessed. They're people who've figured out that staying mentally sharp isn't about sudoku puzzles and crosswords alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between those who remain vibrant conversationalists at 75 and those who retreat into repetitive stories isn't luck. It's a collection of habits, attitudes, and deliberate choices that keep their minds flexible while their joints might not be. These rules aren't complicated or expensive—they're accessible to anyone willing to rethink what aging means for the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. They treat curiosity like oxygen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharpest septuagenarians approach new information like they're still 25 and figuring out the world. They ask follow-up questions about your job, genuinely want to understand cryptocurrency, and aren't afraid to admit when something confuses them. This isn't politeness—it's intellectual survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curiosity prevents the mind from calcifying around old assumptions. When you stop asking "why" and "how," your brain stops building new neural pathways. The mentally agile elderly understand that learning isn't just for the young—it's what keeps you young. They read books outside their comfort zone, watch documentaries about subjects they know nothing about, and aren't embarrassed to be beginners at something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. They collect experiences, not just memories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a difference between having stories and having the same story. Sharp older adults keep adding chapters to their lives instead of just rereading the old ones. They try the new restaurant, take the unfamiliar route, say yes to invitations that younger them might have declined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't about bungee jumping at 80. It's about maintaining &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2023.1232670/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cognitive flexibility&lt;/a&gt;—the ability to adapt thinking to new situations. Every new experience forces the brain to create fresh connections. The mentally vibrant understand that routine might be comfortable, but variation is what keeps neurons firing. They know that the phrase "I've never tried that before" should never fully leave your vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. They embrace technology without surrendering to it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wittiest older adults have smartphones and know how to use them, but they're not enslaved by them. They've learned enough technology to stay connected and informed without letting it overwhelm their identity or dominate their time. They text their grandkids, share memes that actually land, and can navigate streaming services without assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here's the key: they use technology as a tool, not a crutch. They understand that digital engagement opens doors to information and connection, but they don't mistake online interaction for real relationships. They've found the sweet spot between being a Luddite and being lost in the digital world. Their social media posts are coherent, but they also don't live for likes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. They maintain friendships across generations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart 70-somethings don't just hang out with other 70-somethings. They cultivate friendships across age groups, not as mentors or authority figures, but as genuine peers. They have coffee with 40-year-olds, debate politics with 30-year-olds, and aren't threatened by 20-year-olds who know things they don't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cross-generational mixing prevents the echo chamber effect that can make older adults feel disconnected from contemporary life. Younger friends bring fresh perspectives, new vocabulary, and different problems to solve. Research shows that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568163721001471" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;intergenerational connections&lt;/a&gt; can improve cognitive function and social well-being. The mentally sharp elderly understand these friendships aren't about feeling young—they're about staying relevant and engaged with the world as it actually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. They laugh at themselves first&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quickest wit often belongs to those who've learned not to take themselves too seriously. They'll joke about their "senior moments," their technological struggles, their creaking joints—but never in a self-pitying way. They've weaponized self-deprecation as a form of connection, not defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This humor serves a deeper purpose than just getting laughs. Self-directed humor is actually a sophisticated cognitive function that requires perspective-taking and emotional regulation. When you can laugh at your own limitations, you're demonstrating mental flexibility and resilience. The sharpest seniors know that taking yourself too seriously is the fastest way to become a caricature of old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. They read like their brain depends on it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not just newspapers or their favorite genre—they read widely, voraciously, and challengingly. Fiction, non-fiction, long-form journalism, even the occasional graphic novel. They treat reading not as a pastime but as cognitive maintenance, each book a different exercise for different mental muscles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key is variety. Reading only political books that confirm your views is like only doing bicep curls at the gym. The mentally sharp mix it up: a mystery novel followed by a history of jazz, a memoir paired with science writing. They understand that every new author's voice, every unfamiliar subject, forces the brain to work harder, stay more agile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. They pick their battles and forget the rest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp seniors have learned what's worth arguing about and what isn't. They'll engage in spirited debates about things that matter but won't waste energy correcting every wrong opinion or fighting every slight. They've developed what might be called selective passion—intense when it counts, relaxed when it doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn't apathy; it's wisdom. It requires the prefrontal cortex to override the emotional brain's need to be right all the time. Those who stay sharp understand that mental energy is finite, and spending it on petty grievances leaves less for creativity, humor, and genuine connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. They stay physically active without being obsessive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sharpest minds past 70 usually inhabit bodies that move regularly. Not marathon-running necessarily, but walking, swimming, gardening—something that gets blood flowing to the brain. They understand the brain-body connection isn't just wellness-speak; it's biological fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they're not fanatics. They don't bore you with their step count or lecture about their workout routine. They've found sustainable ways to stay active that feel more like living than exercising. Movement is integrated into life, not segregated into gym time. Research consistently shows that even moderate exercise can significantly improve cognitive function in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. They create more than they consume&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it's writing letters, cooking new recipes, woodworking, or watercolors, mentally sharp seniors are makers, not just takers. They produce something—anything—that didn't exist before they created it. This isn't about talent or skill; it's about the act of creation itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating requires the brain to work in ways that consuming never will. It demands problem-solving, planning, and adaptation when things don't go as expected. The act of creation, regardless of the medium, builds cognitive reserve—the brain's ability to maintain function despite age-related changes. Those who stay sharp understand that the question isn't "Am I good at this?" but "Am I engaged by this?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people who remain quick-witted and mentally agile past 70 haven't discovered a secret formula or won a genetic lottery. They've simply refused to accept the narrative that aging means inevitable intellectual decline. They've chosen engagement over withdrawal, curiosity over certainty, growth over stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These rules aren't really rules at all—they're invitations to remain fully alive regardless of age. They recognize that the brain, like any muscle, responds to how you use it. The sharp seniors among us have figured out that wit isn't about being young; it's about being interested. They know that mental agility isn't about denying age; it's about embracing complexity at any age. Most importantly, they understand that staying sharp isn't just about cognitive exercise—it's about maintaining a fundamental belief that there's always something new to learn, someone interesting to meet, and something worth laughing about. Even—especially—yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s an old Babylonian/Biblical legal maxim that goes, “an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Canadian Brent Chapman, his new maxim is “a tooth for an eye,” because he has become the first in his country ever to receive an osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your Latin is on point, you’ll realize that translates to a tooth-in-eye prosthetic—literally Chapman’s tooth has been surgically implanted into his eye to act as a lens fixture which has enabled him to see again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s considered a last resort, and after 50 surgical transplants and procedures, that’s where Chapman was alongside his dedicated ophthalmological surgeon Dr. Greg Moloney, who has been putting Chapman under the knife since he was a teenager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now 34, Brent suffered a rare reaction to ibuprofen at age 13 that left severe burns on his cornea. The cornea acts like a windscreen, keeping debris and liquids out of the eyeball while allowing light to penetrate and reach the retina and optic nerve, but the burns permanently obscured the vision in his right eye while his left was lost entirely to infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tooth-in-eye surgery is rare; very rare—so rare that despite being pioneered in the 1960s Chapman’s procedure is the very first ever done in Canada. According to Dr. Moloney, it’s turned to when all other options have already been tried and failed, or the initial damage to the cornea is so substantial that ophthalmologists know there’s no chance conventional replacements or grafts will succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tooth is chosen because it’s made of the hardest material produced by the body. A hole is drilled through the canine tooth and a hi-tech lens is fitted inside. The tooth is then attached to the cheek through the eye, and an aperture to the retina and optic nerve is created so that the light can enter the lens and reach it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With glasses Chapman has about 20/30 vision, meaning at 20 feet he can see clearly what someone with perfect vision can see at 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Moloney &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/15/health/tooth-in-eye-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;spoke with CNN&lt;/a&gt; about the procedure, the bizarre sense in it, and the effect it has on people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The tooth is a really ideal structure for holding a focusing element in place. It’s hard, it’s rigid, it survives in poor environments, and the body accepts it because it’s part of its own,” said the corneal surgeon from the University of British Columbia. “It’s like watching people come out of a time capsule and reintroduce themselves to the world, it’s very emotional for us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chapman agreed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s really indescribable, to be able to see the whole city and how there’s a whole world that’s just intersecting,” said the professional massage therapist, looking out at Vancouver from Moloney’s office on the 16th floor.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;“Be kind to yourself” is a piece of advice that’s often given to people during difficult times or moments of stress. But for someone who is driven, a perfectionist or facing pressure, the idea of self-compassion can feel uncomfortable. To them, kindness might feel like letting themselves off the hook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But research actually shows that consistently feeling shame and self-judgment can activate the body’s stress response just as strongly as physical danger. This increases &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-6494.2004.00295.x?casa_token=jnaNlof97YMAAAAA%3AIBaA_QcX7cl8Tjc8TlExbFsg-iBCYayZYIqehdTxS-wuCsIYtEo2hIqgKY0Pn33ouALV4A0Hcp35mrTd"&gt;cortisol and inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are linked to long-term health problems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, research suggests that being kind to yourself – known in psychology as “self-compassion” – can actually support motivation, accountability and resilience without the cost of burnout. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35961039/"&gt;Self-compassion&lt;/a&gt; can be defined as the ability to view yourself with kindness and a mindful or balanced perspective on what’s happening to you – as opposed to viewing yourself with judgment, focusing on your mistakes or feeling like you’re alone in your experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://self-compassion.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Germer2019.pdf"&gt;key components&lt;/a&gt; of self-compassion include mindful awareness (noticing your pain or struggle without denial or exaggeration), self-kindness (offering support rather than criticism) and shared humanity (remembering that everyone struggles sometimes and that imperfection is part of being human).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-compassion doesn’t mean letting yourself off the hook. It means staying connected to yourself in a way that supports real, healthy change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But practising self-compassion is often easier said than done. If you’re someone who finds it difficult to be kind to yourself, here are three ways having more self-compassion can be beneficial for you – and how to increase self-compassion in your everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;1. Reduces your body’s stress response&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stress is a natural part of life that our bodies are well-adapted to cope with. It allows us to perform daily tasks and be more engaged. However, consistent exposure to stress without relief may result in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-021-01224-9"&gt;chronic stress&lt;/a&gt;. This can lead to both mental and physical health problems including &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4155/fso.15.21"&gt;cardiovascular disorders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0889-1591(02)00021-1"&gt;decreased immunity&lt;/a&gt; and mental health challenges such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn2297"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reduce exposure to chronic stress, we need to be able to engage our brain’s parasympathetic system – the part of the nervous system that helps the body relax and also controls functions such as digestion and breathing. The parasympathetic system is often stimulated by relaxation and feelings of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2017.07.077"&gt;safety, security and comfort&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-compassion may be a powerful tool in helping create the feeling of security and comfort &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-809837-0.00004-0"&gt;within ourselves&lt;/a&gt; that’s needed to stimulate this internal system. Research suggests self-compassionate thoughts can result in physiological changes such as improved &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12671-018-0900-9"&gt;heart rate variability&lt;/a&gt; – a marker of emotional regulation and resilience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Helps you respond and adapt to feedback&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people fear that too much self-compassion could mean they become self-centred or avoid responsibility. But when we practise self-compassion, we often become more available to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We model healthier &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12671-020-01563-8"&gt;coping strategies&lt;/a&gt;, respond &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.stueduc.2023.101237"&gt;better to feedback&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2018.06.029"&gt;recover faster from setbacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason this happens is because self-compassion teaches us to respond to ourselves with the same care we would offer others. Instead of saying: “I’m not good enough,” a self-compassionate person might say: “This was hard, what can I learn for next time?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Self-compassion can make us more empathetic towards others.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/young-hispanic-woman-office-hugging-oneself-2311197309"&gt;Krakenimages.com/ Shutterstock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better yet, as we begin to show empathy towards our own imperfections and mistakes, we are better able to extend that empathy &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17439760.2013.831465"&gt;towards others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Makes you more likely to succeed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another common fear is that self-compassion will make us &lt;a href="https://psyche.co/ideas/self-compassion-is-not-self-indulgence-heres-how-to-try-it"&gt;lazy or unambitious&lt;/a&gt;. But studies show the opposite to be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who practise self-compassion are more likely to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/17439760.2013.831465"&gt;take responsibility for their actions&lt;/a&gt;, try again after failure and stay engaged with long-term goals. They procrastinate less and take more conscientious, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/15298868.2022.2104363"&gt;less impulsive decisions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, shame and negative self-esteem may drive short-term performance, but we’re &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-37285-9_5"&gt;less likely to maintain&lt;/a&gt; this motivation over time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How to practise self-compassion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’d like to give self-compassion a go, the next time you catch yourself in a loop of harsh self-talk, pause and ask: if someone I loved were in this situation, what would I say to them? Then try offering yourself the same words. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And use neutral, non-judgmental language. Instead of “I shouldn’t feel this way” or “I’ve failed again,” try to make your thinking less personal. You could tell yourself instead: “This is hard” or “I’m not the only one who feels this way.” You could even try to be more forward thinking, asking yourself: “This is my situation right now, what can I do next?” These small shifts reduce emotional reactivity and help support clearer thinking under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, look at the bigger picture. It’s easy to feel alone in our struggles. But everyone, regardless of culture, background or personality, experiences doubt, regret or imperfection. Remind yourself that no one is perfect and everyone has hard days. You’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practices such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2011.07.003"&gt;loving-kindness meditation&lt;/a&gt; can also help with developing self-compassion. During this form of meditation, the focus is on sending good wishes or kind thoughts to yourself and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re navigating illness, chronic stress or the pressures of daily life, being kind to yourself isn’t indulgence – it’s a skill that protects your health, your mind and your future self.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flu shots are now available at many pharmacies, doctors’ offices, and clinics around the country.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The vaccine is the most effective way to protect against severe illness and death from flu.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Despite the changes to COVID vaccine eligibility this year, the CDC and professional medical organizations still recommend everyone get the vaccine this fall.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Federal health agencies are expected to make substantial changes to vaccine guidance this fall. However, the flu vaccine recommendation remains the same: &lt;strong&gt;everyone older than 6 months should get an annual flu shot.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As many as 1.3 million Americans were hospitalized with the flu in the last flu season, and up to 130,000 people died from the disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The flu shot is both safe and life-saving&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; said &lt;a href="https://www.southnassau.org/sn/find-a-doctor/glatt-aaron-e-md-macp-fidsa-fshea-chair-department-26" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Aaron Glatt, MD&lt;/a&gt;, chair of the department of medicine and chief of infectious diseases at Mount Sinai South Nassau Hospital.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here’s what you need to know as you prepare for your flu shot this year.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/who-should-not-get-flu-shots-770429" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;no differences in who can get a flu vaccine&lt;/a&gt; this year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends it for all people ages 6 months or older, with rare exceptions.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The CDC’s &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/fall-covid-vaccine-guide-11777880" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;changes to COVID-10 vaccine recommendations&lt;/a&gt; don’t apply to flu vaccines. The agency’s advisory panel is scheduled to meet in late September to discuss routine vaccines against COVID and other diseases, but not the flu vaccine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-when-should-you-get-the-flu-shot"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; When Should You Get the Flu Shot? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The vaccines are available now in many pharmacies, clinics, and doctors’ offices across the country. Flu cases typically pick up in October and peak in February, though that varies by year and region.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Glatt said it’s wise to get your flu shot sooner rather than later to ensure you’re protected when flu rears its head in your community. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;“You should have very good immunity in September that will last you through the flu season. Waiting until October isn't necessarily a dangerous thing if there's no flu around, but you probably want to have immunity when flu comes to your region,” Glatt said.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; He added that it's still worthwhile to get the flu shot even if you haven’t gotten one by the end of October. Flu circulates in most places until April, and it’s helpful to be protected through the winter and early spring. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-can-you-get-it-the-same-time-as-your-covid-shot"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Can You Get It the Same Time as Your COVID Shot? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Since the COVID vaccines debuted in 2021, the CDC and medical groups have said that &lt;strong&gt;people can safely get the COVID and flu shots at the same time without diminishing their effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In a late August &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/188486/download" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;memo&lt;/a&gt;, the FDA’s top vaccine official said he “cannot affirm” that co-administering the vaccines is safe and effective and that the agency would start requiring vaccine makers to run clinical trials before making that claim.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.taskforce.org/employees/joe-bresee/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Joseph Bresee, MD&lt;/a&gt;, director of respiratory virus prevention and preparedness at The Task Force for Global Health, said that there is sound evidence that the practice is safe and people should feel comfortable getting their COVID and flu shots in the same visit while the FDA collects more data.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “More importantly, the ability to get vaccines together during the same visit creates an opportunity to expand the reach of these vaccines,” Bresee told Verywell. “If you make folks come back for one vaccine and then another vaccine in two weeks, you may lose some folks and miss the opportunity to get them vaccinated.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-much-will-the-flu-shot-cost"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Much Will the Flu Shot Cost? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If you have health insurance, the flu vaccine should be free to you.&lt;/strong&gt; Insurers are required to cover all vaccines recommended by the CDC’s advisory panel.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can now order the &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/what-is-the-nasal-flu-vaccine-flumist-770756" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;FluMist nasal spray vaccine&lt;/a&gt; to be delivered to your home.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This allows caretakers to give the vaccine or for people to self-administer without visiting a pharmacy or doctor’s office.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The nasal spray is safe and effective for people ages 2 to 49 years old who are not pregnant or immunocompromised.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_47-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It’s a nice option for people who have trouble getting to the doctor or the clinic, who are homebound for whatever reason,” Bresee said. “Many of those people are at higher risk for severe disease because they have underlying illnesses, and that's the reason they can't leave the house as easily.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We won’t know exactly how effective this year’s flu vaccine is until around February.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; That’s because the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/flu-vaccine-effectiveness-5211793" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;flu vaccine formula changes every year&lt;/a&gt; based on predictions from global health experts about which viral strains will circulate in the upcoming season. &lt;strong&gt;When the strains are well matched, the vaccine is usually between 40% and 60% effective at preventing severe illness and death from flu.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_54-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It's important to realize that getting the flu vaccine doesn't mean that you won't get the flu,” Glatt said. “Get vaccinated: if you do get the flu, you'll probably have a much milder episode. It certainly has been shown that it prevents hospitalizations, it prevents serious illness, and it prevents death.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The FDA recently expanded eligibility for the Flublok vaccine, a recombinant flu vaccine, to people as young as 9 years old.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Flublok uses a different technology than standard flu vaccines, which has been shown to be more effective in older adults. The CDC says all the options available for people younger than 65 are similarly effective.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Flu vaccines are very, very safe vaccines. They've been given hundreds of millions of times over decades, and &lt;strong&gt;the most common side effects are locally sore arms or a little redness around for about 24 hours&lt;/strong&gt;,” Bresee said.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “&lt;strong&gt;Otherwise, they're very safe, and we shouldn't expect any new side effects popping up this year.&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_63-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Anyone who has had significant allergic reactions to the flu or other vaccines in the past should talk to a health care provider before getting the shot. Otherwise, the vaccine is safe for just about everyone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_64-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_65-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Your doctor is your best source of information. He knows you.

To stay healthy and avoid getting others sick, make it a habit to wash your hands, cover your cough, stay home when you’re sick, and wear a mask if you’re contagious or worried about exposure. If you have flu, your doctor can prescribe you Tamiflu to help manage the symptoms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

As a GP myself, I knew how serious my condition was,' she told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/article/burnout-relief-techniquest-longevity-alka-patel-rl5r2vrkg"&gt;The Times&lt;/a&gt; of her 2011 health scare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With three children and a successful but often stressful career, Dr Patel admitted that she never slowed down enough to notice the red-flag warning signs that she was about to crash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was rushed to hospital by her husband—Mandish, a dentist—after her temperature continued to climb past 38C, where she underwent emergency abdominal surgery, as doctors suspected an abscess in her abdomen could be to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But they found nothing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After being discharged following a month-long recovery stint in hospital, Dr Patel knew something needed to change, as it dawned on her that her resilience to stress after years of pushing the brink of burnout was to blame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now 14 years later, aged 53, Dr Patel has turned back the clock and has an impressive biological age—the age of her cells—of a 20-year-old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Alka Patel was hospitalised as her organs began to shut down before she hit reset—tracking everything from her blood sugar, sleep and heart rate to turn back her biological clock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Strange as it sounds, science shows we can bring our age down in measurable ways,' she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm proof of this. And while biohacking might bring to mind wealthy tech titans trying to live forever, many of the techniques I now tech clients as a longevity doctor are free, take minutes and can add decades to our lives.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She added: 'Your biological age is not an ego-fuelled number—it's your health forecast. By dropping your biological age, we can liver longer, with less pain, more energy and agility and with fewer prescriptions.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Here the Daily Mail breaks down her daily routine, in which she prioritises sleep, diet and exercise for a longer, healthier life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;The power of a good routine &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite advising her patients to get the recommended 7-9 hours of sleep a night, Dr Patel rarely got more than four hours a night, working long after her children had gone to bed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But now, she has devised a night time routine that slows down ageing by allowing the body to repair cells, replenish depleted energy levels and clear toxic brain matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Every night she sets an alarm for 9.30pm which signals her screen curfew, before she gets into bed an hour later. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Patel discovered that her stress levels, which contribute to inflammation when raised, were not dropping low enough at night to allow for deep restorative sleep &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists have long urged people to ditch screens before bed because the blue light they emit suppresses melatonin—a hormone produced naturally in the body that plays a crucial role in regulating the sleep-wake cycle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the evening, it can signal to your body that it's still time to be alert, throwing off your natural wind-down process. But, experts have also warned that forcing yourself to go to bed with nothing to occupy your mind, can also&lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15054385/sleep-therapist-five-hacks-insomnia-WORSE.html"&gt; impact your sleep and fuel insomnia. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This hour in between switching off the TV and putting her phone on do not disturb creates the perfect wind-down window, promoting the production of melatonin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Book in hand, Dr Patel gets into bed calm and ready for a restorative 8 hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Morning &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Patel starts her morning with five stretches she holds for 50 seconds—including one that works on balance, such as calf raises—whilst brushing her teeth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A  study of 1,7000 people aged 50-75 found people who couldn't stand on one leg for at least 10 seconds had an 84 per cent increased risk of death after seven years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This forms a central part of Dr Patel's biohacking, in which she ranks her most-used hacks from 1-10, with a correlating activity or time, to make them easier to implement—showing that no matter how busy you are, you can always find 60 seconds to turn back the clock. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Patel recommends habit stacking to implement her most-used biohacks into her routine. For example, whilst cleaning her teeth she will perform calf-raises to improve her balance (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the morning, she also practices her 1-10 hack which involves spending one minute in natural sunlight, followed by 10 seconds setting an intention for the day—with purpose being one of the key pillars of &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-15014419/Blue-Zone-UK-live-100-plymouth.html"&gt;blue zone centenarians. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is when she takes her first three sips of water, which she does every 30 minutes for the rest of the day—with one study finding those with lower fluid intake have a 21 per cent higher risk of dying early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At 10am, Dr Patel has her first meal, restricting her eating to an eight-hour window to encourage autophagy—the medical term for cell repair. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Midday &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After filling up on protein and fibre for lunch, Dr Patel goes for a walk or run followed by a quick dumbbell session, which she keeps under her desk at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This helps redirect blood glucose to the muscles, slashing the risk of diabetes by keeping blood sugar levels under control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She also makes sure to switch up her posture, alternating between sitting and standing at her desk every 90 minutes to boost circulation and promote heart health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Patel keeps dumbbells under her standing desk at work which she uses every day after lunch to help keep blood sugar spikes under control &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead"&gt;Evening &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is when Dr Patel practices gratitude and reflects on her day, to lower stress and improve cognitive function—implementing seven seconds of silence every 70 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Paying compliments, meanwhile, is important because it releases the bonding hormone oxytocin,' she added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Oxytocin has been shown to affect the same centre of the brain as physical pain and may play a role in reducing inflammation and feelings of loneliness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is followed by an early dinner, giving the body enough time to finish digesting and before going to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eating too close to bed has long been linked to digestive issues, poor sleep and higher glucose spikes—all of which accelerate the ageing process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 11:47:29 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQS2NzMEhJT3JHRndMQVlVUEEtUHp1ODczd19BTFlEYzY4ZlRVai1fZzVjX2UtNlBQb1ZDVzNac0IxRnhHR2xvb05SZ0JmX1lWekhFbFprR2xlWEMtX1NaRS1SUEpueWNXWDUwUDUxQzEwZGNlUnZKTlVqWFlpVGgzanhqSzJYam5WRklKbnZzTmjSAZYBQVVfeXFMUFNPbFI2MmgyNVlLSGxMdkxKdzJaNzNvcHhyNEVWUWRmcTAxZWxoR3RucUJZQW1HbmR5S1Y0dmUtU214NlNJMWpKcU5GZGd1UjQ5a2JPWkk4S1lFS2s4XzFoREJJUGZSdElTVmp3blNFMzRmb29ZOHBJSzlwYlJsZFFzZkxyTVBmSFBnOXhwVnlTMGtPaEN3</guid></item><item><title>如果您剃发、剪发或拔发，您的头发会发生什么-《华盛顿邮报》</title><link>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/09/16/cutting-shaving-plucking-waxing-hair-growth/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JMRLLMVJJJBTFL3GN4EBUEU22M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Does cutting or shaving hair make it grow back faster, darker or thicker?

Cereal, bananas, sweet potatoes, or something else? For years, advice has been vague. Scientists now suggest that blueberries may deserve a place on that list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blueberries are packed with color-rich compounds, fiber, and vitamins. Adults eat them for heart and brain health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now, though, no one had rigorously tested them in infants. A team at the &lt;a href="https://www.cuanschutz.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Colorado Anschutz&lt;/a&gt; decided to change that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers designed a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Sixty-one babies between five and twelve months joined. Some received blueberry powder each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others received a powder without blueberries. Parents mixed the powder into normal &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/unstable-gut-microbes-can-worsen-child-malnutrition/"&gt;meals&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing else in the routine had to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-linking-blueberries-and-allergies"&gt;Linking blueberries and allergies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of the study, the blueberry group showed fewer allergy symptoms, especially respiratory ones. Inflammation markers also shifted. IL-13, a molecule tied to asthma and allergies, dropped. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IL-10, known for calming the immune system, nudged upward. These results suggest blueberries encourage balance, not overreaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For parents beginning to wean their infants, it’s incredibly difficult to find solid, research-backed advice on what &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/key-to-cutting-food-waste-is-in-our-daily-routines/"&gt;foods&lt;/a&gt; to introduce,” said senior author Minghua Tang, PhD, adjoint associate professor of pediatrics at &lt;a href="https://www.cuanschutz.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CU Anschutz&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This study is a critical first step in filling that gap by offering real data on how a specific food like blueberries can improve your infant’s health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-blueberries-protect-babies"&gt;How blueberries protect babies&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blueberries owe much of their power to anthocyanins, the pigments that give them a dark blue color. These compounds protect the gut lining, reduce inflammation, and discourage harmful bacteria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also influence immune cells by turning down allergy-driving signals and boosting tolerance-building ones. In plain words, they help the immune system learn when to stay calm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infant gut bacteria shifted too. Beneficial groups such as Lactobacillus linked with more IL-10. Less friendly microbes like Citrobacter showed ties to IL-13. These shifts reveal how &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/everyday-kitchen-tool-that-could-be-leaching-toxins-into-your-food-polypropylene-cutting-board/"&gt;diet&lt;/a&gt; influences microbes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern suggests blueberries push gut communities in directions that support calmer immune activity, reducing unnecessary inflammation, encouraging tolerance, and possibly lowering the chance of early allergy development in infants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-blueberries-support-long-term-health"&gt;Blueberries support long-term health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not every improvement lined up neatly. Some babies improved without clear biomarker changes, and some biomarker shifts didn’t translate directly into fewer symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That mismatch highlights the complexity of the gut–immune connection. Diet seems to nudge the system, but it doesn’t act through one simple pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research supports the idea that blueberries are not only safe for infants but also offer meaningful health benefits,” said Minghua Tang, who is also a researcher at the Colorado Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute and &lt;a href="https://www.colostate.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Colorado State University&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just a few blueberries a day could make a difference in supporting long-term health. We view infancy as a critical window of opportunity and what we introduce during this time can have lasting effects as children grow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-early-diet-and-allergy-risks"&gt;Early diet and allergy risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allergic conditions are on the rise worldwide. Eczema, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/simple-way-to-remove-microplastics-from-tap-water-home-faucet/"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; allergies, and asthma often appear in childhood and can persist into adulthood. Scientists increasingly believe that early diet plays a role in either fueling or calming these risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breastfeeding remains the gold standard, but once solids start, the choice of foods may also matter more than once thought. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blueberries now join a list of foods being tested for their ability to train the immune system during this vulnerable window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health agencies encourage introducing a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and grains around six months. Yet parents often hesitate, especially with foods they fear might trigger allergies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research like this helps reduce uncertainty. It suggests that some foods not only avoid harm but may actively help protect against allergies when offered early in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-introducing-babies-to-blueberries"&gt;Introducing babies to blueberries &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team stresses this was an early trial. More infants, longer follow-ups, and fresh blueberries instead of powder are next on the agenda. Other foods rich in similar compounds may also help, but those studies still lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, families can introduce blueberries safely once babies begin solids. Puree them for the youngest. Mash or slice them for older babies and toddlers to avoid choking. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A handful here and there may help more than just nutrition – it could shape long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/17/17/2795" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 16 Sep 2025 11:28:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNUVlaaGYzZDQ4d3Z1VVRYZFZOdU9JU3FmdkczZXdadVB0R3pXRGR4X1djWGtIT3NibFdqTzZEV2hqTG5rNE1VaEF0aW9fUWpXc0owOUVQUzV5Q0Rfck1aQUNyUk1KbXpwMlkwNVN5SHBmZTdWckJRX2N2ZnhLUG1teDFOMzlMWU1aUGc</guid></item><item><title>数十亿被黑客入侵的蚊子和疫苗如何击败致命的登革热病毒-自然</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02918-8</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__teaser" data-test="access-teaser"&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Support for this article was provided by the Pulitzer Center.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, a parade of vehicles wound its way through three cities in Brazil, releasing clouds of mosquitoes into the air.

A &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02492-1" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02492-1" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;biofactory&lt;/a&gt; that opened in the town of Curitiba in July can produce 100 million mosquito eggs per week — making it the largest such facility in the world. The company that runs it, Wolbito do Brasil, aims to protect about 14 million Brazilians per year through its &lt;i&gt;Wolbachia&lt;/i&gt;-infected mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That will come as welcome news for the Brazilian health officials battling the rapidly &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02423-w" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02423-w" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;growing threat of dengue&lt;/a&gt;. In 2024, the country experienced its worst outbreak yet: with 6.6 million probable cases and more than 6,300 related deaths. This year’s outbreak, although less severe, is also one of the highest on record, with 1.6 million probable cases so far (see ‘Dangerous outbreaks’). And the problem is spreading. Argentina, Colombia and Peru also experienced record-breaking outbreaks in 2024 and have seen a sustained increase in cases in recent years. Across Latin America and the Caribbean, deaths from dengue last year totalled more than 8,400 and the global figure reached &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue" data-track="click" data-label="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue" data-track-category="body text link"&gt;more than 12,000&lt;/a&gt; — the highest ever recorded for this disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02918-8/d41586-025-02918-8_51447690.png?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02918-8/d41586-025-02918-8_51447690.png?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="DANGEROUS OUTBREAKS.

A locally produced dengue vaccine is now awaiting approval by the country’s drug-regulatory agency, and its health ministry expects to start administering tens of millions of doses by next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These twin advances offer some hope to other countries — in the region and beyond. Driven by forces such as climate change, mosquito adaptation, globalized trade and movements of people, dengue is becoming a crisis worldwide, with an estimated 3.9 billion people at risk of infection. As Brazil rolls out its armies of infected mosquitoes and a vaccine in the coming year, the rest of the world will be watching closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The local approach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, there is one main dengue vaccine in use around the world: Qdenga, licensed by the Japanese pharmaceutical company Takeda. The vaccine has been approved in many countries, including Brazil, which was the first nation to include it in its public-health system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Qdenga’s roll-out in Brazil is limited. The country bought nine million doses of the two-dose vaccine this year: enough to vaccinate 4.5 million of its population of more than 210 million. So far, Qdenga has been administered to children between the ages of 10 and 14, one of the groups most likely to end up in hospital after contracting dengue, together with older people. Its safety and efficacy have not yet been tested in adults aged over 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main reasons for such a limited roll-out in Brazil are availability and cost. Even though Brazil secured Qdenga from Takeda at one of the cheapest prices in the world —around US$19 per dose — the cost is still high compared with other vaccines. And even in the most optimistic scenario, the maximum number of doses Takeda could provide by 2028 is 50 million — enough to vaccinate 25 million people. What’s more, for people who have not had dengue before, clinical trials did not show Qdenga to be effective against all four variants — or serotypes — of the dengue virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;article class="recommended pull pull--left u-sans-serif" data-label="Related"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-02677-6" class="u-link-inherit" data-track="click" data-track-label="recommended article"&gt;&lt;img class="recommended__image" alt="" src="//media.nature.com/w400/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02918-8/d41586-025-02918-8_51380440.jpg"&gt;&lt;p class="recommended__title u-serif"&gt;When will dengue strike? Outbreaks sync with heat and rain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil is trying to address all of those limitations with its one-dose vaccine candidate, developed at the Butantan Institute, a public biomedical research centre in São Paulo. “Having local production capacity gives us independence on decisions — how many doses we need, and at what speed to vaccinate,” says Esper Kallás, Butantan’s director. “You can practise prices that are more suitable and absorbable by a public-health system such as Brazil’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Butantan is also optimistic that its vaccine will be effective against all four forms of dengue. Severe disease usually occurs when a person is infected by a different serotype to their first infection. That means that a successful vaccine needs to generate antibodies for all four serotypes without triggering severe reactions, which makes it a difficult vaccine to develop. “It was indeed a challenge, as each serotype behaves differently,” says Neuza Frazatti Gallina, manager of the viral vaccine development laboratory at Butantan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine’s development began at the US National Institutes of Health in the late 1990s, where scientists transformed dengue viruses they had isolated from patients into weakened vaccine strains that could trigger the production of protective antibodies without causing disease. In 2009, Butantan extended that research by working to solve the challenges of combining the four strains into a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt;&lt;picture class="embed intensity--high"&gt;&lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02918-8/d41586-025-02918-8_51444128.jpg?as=webp 767w, //media.nature.com/lw319/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02918-8/d41586-025-02918-8_51444128.jpg?as=webp 319w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 319px, (min-width: 1023px) 100vw,  767px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img class="figure__image" alt="Close up view of a hand holding a vial of mosquito eggs to the light." loading="lazy" src="//media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-025-02918-8/d41586-025-02918-8_51444128.jpg"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;p class="figure__caption u-sans-serif"&gt;&lt;span class="mr10"&gt;Eggs of mosquitoes infected with &lt;i&gt;Wolbachia&lt;/i&gt; bacteria.

The study reported that two years after vaccinations, the formulation was 89% effective in preventing infections in people who had previously been infected with dengue, and 74% effective in those with no previous exposure&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR1" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was a well-designed trial,” says Annelies Wilder-Smith, who is team lead for vaccine development at the World Health Organization (WHO). But she says one limitation of the trial is that it was conducted in a single country, and therefore runs a risk that all four serotypes were not circulating at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, serotypes 3 and 4 were not prevalent during the data-collection period of the clinical trial, although they are now circulating in Brazil. Butantan researchers suggest that the vaccine will be effective against serotypes 3 and 4, pointing to data from a phase II trial&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-CR2" data-track="click" data-action="anchor-link" data-track-label="go to reference" data-track-category="references"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in 300 adults that showed participants produced neutralizing antibodies to each of the serotypes. That study evaluated safety and immunological response in the short term, rather than looking at the vaccine’s long-term efficacy in preventing infections. The full results of the Brazilian phase III trial — which will provide data on long-term effectiveness — are not yet public and are undergoing peer review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is already moving through the country’s regulatory process. And although there’s still no certainty about when Anvisa, Brazil’s regulatory agency, will approve the vaccine, the government is counting on it. In February, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva announced that, starting in 2026, the Ministry of Health would be buying 60 million doses annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To meet that demand, Butantan is now producing the vaccine at its São Paulo facility. On its lush campus, an entire building is dedicated to churning out doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the vaccine’s approval, “We are very confident,” says Kallás. “We also anticipate that there is a very prominent need to have this product in the arms of people. So we hit the road running and started producing vaccines late last year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Butantan’s production efforts will focus initially on meeting Brazil’s need for millions of doses, Kallás expects that the vaccine could reach other countries. Butantan has been discussing with its development partner — the pharmaceutical giant Merck — and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) how to make the vaccine accessible to other countries. The logical first step, he says, would be to roll it out through PAHO to Latin America and the Caribbean, and then to other regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Merck is developing a potential vaccine for Asia with an almost identical formulation, which builds on the knowledge that Butantan has developed. In a statement, the drug firm said that Butantan is “sharing clinical data and other learnings”. In June, Merck started enrolling participants for its own phase III trial. “All the data, experiences and insights they have collected with the Butantan vaccine will be helpful,” says Wilder-Smith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Infecting mosquitoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Butantan awaits news about the vaccine’s approval, the &lt;i&gt;Wolbachia&lt;/i&gt; method to control dengue is gaining momentum. The World Mosquito Program (WMP) — a non-profit group of companies owned by Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, where the strategy was developed — has operations in 14 countries, including Vietnam, Indonesia, Mexico and Colombia, but Brazil leads the way in terms of the scale of its expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The method’s arrival in the Americas is tied to Brazilian researcher Luciano Moreira, now the chief executive of Wolbito do Brazil. &lt;i&gt;Wolbachia&lt;/i&gt; is naturally present in around 50% of insects, but not in the mosquito species &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt;, which is the main transmitter of dengue and many other viruses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="wp-block-cgb-lede"&gt;&lt;p class="lede-content hide"&gt;The advisory committee makes recommendations to the CDC on what vaccines the American public should take each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Monday named a Maui children’s physician who used unapproved drugs to treat Covid to serve on a powerful federal advisory panel on vaccine policy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kirk Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist and pastor at Calvary Chapel South Maui, provided the livestock drug ivermectin and the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to prevent and treat the coronavirus during free house calls for Maui residents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He and four others named Monday join the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html"&gt;Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices&lt;/a&gt; at a fraught moment in public health. In June, Kennedy &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/press-room/hhs-restore-public-trust-vaccines-acip.html"&gt;fired all 17 sitting members of the panel&lt;/a&gt; that makes recommendations to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about how vaccines should be used, saying that a clean sweep is necessary to restore public trust in vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the health secretary’s picks have already been contentious, however. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ACIP member Robert Malone has been a vocal critic of Covid mRNA vaccines, blaming &lt;a href="https://x.com/RWMaloneMD/status/1908665463279677915"&gt;two deaths of unvaccinated children in the Texas measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; on “medical mismanagement” without citing any evidence. He and Milhoan are among several anti-vaccine voices on the panel.&lt;/p&gt;

(Cory Lum/Civil Beat/2021)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Hawaiʻi, Milhoan’s embrace of discredited Covid treatments has made him &lt;a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2021/08/from-masks-to-vaccines-how-churches-have-power-over-public-health/"&gt;a controversial figure&lt;/a&gt;. He did not require masks or social distancing at Calvary Church of South Maui during the height of the pandemic, saying the church’s mission must continue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His use of discredited drugs during the pandemic was &lt;a href="https://health.hawaii.gov/news/newsroom/doh-statement-on-the-pono-coalition-for-informed-consent/"&gt;widely condemned&lt;/a&gt; by Hawaiʻi officials, including former Gov. David Ige and former Hawaiʻi Health Director Libby Char.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He and &lt;a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/2021/08/that-is-not-aloha-dr-lorrin-pang-is-pushing-back-against-his-critics/"&gt;Dr. Lorrin Pang&lt;/a&gt;, the state’s top medical adviser for Maui County, co-founded The Pono Coalition for Informed Consent, a website that called the Covid vaccines experimental and advocated instead for the use of unproven drugs. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Hawaiʻi Medical Board filed a complaint against him and Pang in August 2021 that, if substantiated, could have led to the loss of their state medical licenses. The state Regulated Industries Complaints Office dropped the complaint eight months later and took &lt;a href="https://www.civilbeat.org/beat/state-drops-complaint-against-top-maui-medical-professional/"&gt;no disciplinary actions&lt;/a&gt; against them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More recently, Milhoan participated in &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/d41d8cd9/rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-leads-a-hearing-on-injuries-caused-by-covid-19-vaccin/6998956623513668/"&gt;a 2024 hearing&lt;/a&gt; hosted by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, a Republican from Georgia, on Covid-19 vaccine injuries. During the hearing he &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/discredited-covid-19-vaccine-skeptics-130000894.html"&gt;advocated against vaccinating children&lt;/a&gt;, alleging the Covid vaccine had triggered cardiac problems in some pediatric patients he’d seen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Milhoan and his wife operate &lt;a href="https://forheartsandsouls.org/who-we-are/"&gt;For Hearts and Souls&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit Christian medical ministry which provides medical care to children around the world with cardiac problems who lack access to treatment. He is a senior fellow at the &lt;a href="https://imahealth.org/"&gt;Independent Medical Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, a group formed in March 2020 that advocates for dubious Covid treatments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He has an active medical license in Hawai‘i, Montana, Wyoming and Texas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reached by email Monday, Milhoan, who traveled to Washington, D.C., for his appointment, declined to be interviewed. He cited a request made by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that all interviews be coordinated by the agency’s media team. The HHS media team did not respond to phone and email requests for comment or for an interview.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-revisiting-guidance"&gt;Revisiting Guidance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The newly configured panel is being convened as public trust in routine vaccines continues to decline nationally. One in six parents reported &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/"&gt;delaying or skipping at least one vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, other than Covid or the flu, for their children in a new KFF-Washington Post survey published Monday of more than 2,700 parents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next ACIP meeting is scheduled for Thursday and Friday, when the panel is expected to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-09-12-508.pdf"&gt;discuss vaccines against Covid&lt;/a&gt;, hepatitis B, measles, mumps, rubella and varicella, the virus that causes chickenpox. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As with flu shots, there are new Covid formulations each fall, to account for changes in which strains are circulating. The committee has not yet voted on whether to recommend this season’s Covid shots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In June, Kennedy’s ACIP members suggested they wanted to revisit the guidance on Hepatitis B, which can cause serious liver infections. In adults, the virus is spread through sex or through sharing needles during injection-drug use. The virus also can be passed to a baby from an infected mother, and as many as 90% of infected infants go on to have chronic infections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A hepatitis B vaccine was first licensed in the U.S. in 1981. In 2005, the ACIP recommended a dose within 24 hours of birth for all medically stable infants who weigh at least 4.4 pounds. Infant vaccinations are stressed for women who have hepatitis B or who have not been tested for it. The infant shots are 85% to 95% effective in preventing chronic hepatitis B infections, studies have shown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Newborn hepatitis B vaccinations are considered a success, and no recent peer-reviewed research shows any safety problems with giving kids the shots on their first day of life, said Dr. William Schaffner, a Vanderbilt University vaccines expert.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The government first recommended that all children get a chickenpox vaccine in 1995, leading to a dramatic drop in cases and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chickenpox was once a common childhood annoyance, causing an itchy skin rash and fever. But the highly contagious virus can also lead to complications such as skin infections, swelling of the brain and pneumonia. Severe cases are more common among teens and adults who get it for the first time. The virus also can reactivate later in life and cause the painful illness called shingles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The other new panel members announced on Monday, bringing the total to 12, are Dr. Catherine Stein, an epidemiologist and professor at Case Western Reserve University; Dr. Evelyn Griffin, an obstetrician-gynecologist from Louisiana; Dr. Hillary Blackburn, director of medication access and affordability at AscensionRx; and Dr. Raymond Pollak, an organ transplant surgeon with a background in immunology. &lt;/p&gt;

            Chagas disease, a potentially deadly condition caused by a parasite carried by insects called kissing bugs, should now be considered endemic in the United States, experts say – and without recognition that it’s a constant presence in some parts of the country, more people will suffer unnecessarily.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60002336nkea8aeh9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/31/9/24-1700_article" target="_blank"&gt;A report&lt;/a&gt; on the topic was published last week in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, and the authors say they hope that growing global attention on the new paper means Chagas could finally get the surveillance, prevention and testing efforts and research funding it deserves in the United States.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60004336nqxxclofm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’ve been waiting forever; all of us Chagas people have been waiting for people to recognize this disease is in our communities,” said Dr. Norman Beatty, coauthor of the report and &lt;a href="https://id.medicine.ufl.edu/profile/beatty-norman/" target="_blank"&gt;a clinical associate professor&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Florida College of Medicine’s Division of Infectious Diseases &amp;amp; Global Medicine who has studied Chagas for the past decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis)" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; considers Chagas a &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/topics/chagas-disease#:~:text=Chagas%20disease%20is%20a%20parasitic,of%20America%20and%20the%20world." target="_blank"&gt;neglected tropical disease&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/topics/chagas-disease#:~:text=Chagas%20disease%20is%20a%20parasitic,of%20America%20and%20the%20world." target="_blank"&gt;the Pan American Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; says it is endemic – with a constant presence or usual prevalence – in 21 other countries in the Americas, not including the United States. Chagas is one of the leading causes of heart disease in Latin America, and it causes more disability than other insect-borne infections, even more than malaria and Zika, &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40475-019-0170-1#ref-CR1" target="_blank"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60006336nucdkiiww@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Chagas largely spreads when triatomine bugs, commonly known as kissing bugs, bite a human while they’re sleeping. The bug defecates in that bite or on a person’s face, and the person unwittingly wipes the feces into their eyes, nose or mouth. The feces can carry a parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, that causes the disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Chagas &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/chagas-disease-(american-trypanosomiasis)" target="_blank"&gt;can also spread&lt;/a&gt; through contaminated food or blood, organ transplants and pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60007336nnwrt5n09@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Early symptoms can include fever, body aches, headaches, rash, vomiting and tiredness. They may last weeks or even months after initial infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt6000a336n46075m90@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to the CDC, about 20% to 30% of people who’ve been infected develop more serious problems like long-term digestive and nervous system conditions, &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000599#:~:text=Background:,suspected%20or%20confirmed%20Chagas%20disease." target="_blank"&gt;heart failure&lt;/a&gt;, stroke or death.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt60008336n3bzcz2jk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If it’s caught early, the disease can be cured with benznidazole or nifurtimox, medicines that kill the parasite. But the drugs become less effective the longer a person has been infected, and most people remain unaware of the disease. Many doctors don’t think to look for it in patients in the US, the new report noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflobcrr000a3b6qldijporx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In fact, some people who are infected find out some time later, when they donate blood, since the US has been testing its blood supply for Chagas since 2007.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt6000b336n9zq95kqm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Surveillance is limited, but &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/chagas/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;the CDC estimates&lt;/a&gt; that about 280,000 people in the US have Chagas at any given time. It’s unclear how many have the more serious form of the disease or how many deaths are caused by Chagas each year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt6000c336n8tl8gjl3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientists have found kissing bugs in 32 states, the new report says. The blood-sucking insect mostly lives in warmer Southern states, but with climate change causing more bug-friendly temperatures, there’s a good chance they have spread farther.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000d336n8wqdxrky@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Scientistst have identified at least 17 states with infected mammals, including Virginia opossums, raccoons, banded armadillos, striped skunks, coyotes and wood rats, according to the latest report. Veterinarians have seen infections in zoo animals and pets, including cats, dogs and a horse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000e336nte0v7otw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors have reported Chagas cases in humans in eight states: Arkansas, Arizona, California, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas. There are probably more cases, the new report says, but doctors are not required to report Chagas infections in most states.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsotx0000336nf9fpwfl0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It would be “momentous” for Chagas to be declared endemic in the US, said Dr. Mario J. Grijalva, director of the Infectious and Tropical Disease Institute and professor in the Department of Biomedical Sciences at Ohio University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflskphj000q3b6qkmgkpfnh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you consider it a problem that belongs to others, it’s not important. But when it’s a problem affecting people here, the recognition that it is an endemic disease in the United States is a game-changer, at least in terms of the public policy possibilities and the awareness that is required to properly address this complicated issue,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmfls921l001i336nhzfm5nrs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Grijalva knows firsthand what a difference it can make to have awareness and a concerted health campaign. He spent his recent sabbatical riding a motorcycle across Latin America to spread the word about the condition, after making a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBwYpF14vNs" target="_blank"&gt;similar motorcycle trip in the US&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflsmh5k000s3b6qdo9se4is@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In countries like Ecuador and Peru where Chagas is endemic but there is no concerted government efforts to manage it, most people were unaware of the disease, Grijalva said. But in Chile, Bolivia and Argentina - all countries with robust health and public awareness campaigns – the people he spoke with knew about Chagas, and many cases were being well-managed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflsoet4000x3b6q7rwyeqhi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There has been a lot of effort to fight this in those countries,” Grijalva said. “It can be fought, and there are a lot of successes.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000f336n1rdp5igo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Beatty hopes broader recognition of Chagas in the US will prompt officials to step up surveillance efforts like what he’s seen in some other countries. He also hopes health care providers learn to recognize cases sooner and wishes the US would work to protect people from kissing bugs like it does mosquitoes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000g336njp70r42p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We have mosquito control programs around the country, but we’re essentially doing nothing about kissing bugs,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000h336ng94jpj19@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the meantime, he said, people aiming to keep the insects away can better seal their homes, use window screens and spray for bugs. However, he has not found any particular spray specifically approved to target kissing bugs in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000i336nrqasd7bs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And in Florida, where he works and where about 30% of kissing bugs seem to be positive for the parasites, Beatty said, people will often send him bug photos or even drop the insects off at his hospital to be tested.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000j336nx5zhim7x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “They’re scared,” he said – and they have a right to be.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000k336np8egbvwy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Beatty said he tries to help his community as best he can. “There’s not another doctor around here walking around with bugs in their pockets,” he said. But with more awareness, he hopes others will step up as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmflnsrt7000l336nux2vmww4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I’m just one person,” Beatty said. “It’s a small team, and we have limited resources.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A key federal vaccine advisory panel whose members were recently replaced by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is expected to vote to recommend delaying, until age 4, the hepatitis B vaccine that's currently given to newborns, according to two former senior officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"There is going to likely be a discussion about hepatitis B vaccine, very specifically trying to dislodge the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine and to push it later in life," said Demetre Daskalakis, the former director for the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. "Apparently this is a priority of the Secretary's."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The vote is expected to take place Thursday during the next meeting of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP. The &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/-6uBNXsYRHQ" target="_blank"&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; is scheduled for September 18-19 at a CDC office in Atlanta, Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;For more than 30 years, the CDC has advised that infants get the first of three shots of the hepatitis B vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/perinatal-provider-overview/vaccine-administration.html?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/HBV/VaccChildren.htm" target="_blank"&gt;at birth&lt;/a&gt;. In that time, the potentially fatal disease has been virtually eradicated among American children. Between 1990 and 2022, case rates plummeted 99 percent among people age 19 and younger.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pediatricians warn that waiting until age 4 to begin vaccination opens the door to more children contracting the virus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Age four makes zero sense," said pediatrician &lt;a href="https://aapca1.org/profile/eric-ball-md-district-ix-vice-chair/" target="_blank"&gt;Eric Ball&lt;/a&gt;, who practices in Orange County, California. "We recommend a universal approach to prevent those cases where a test might be incorrect or a mother might have unknowingly contracted hepatitis. It's really the best way to keep our entire population healthy."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In addition to the hepatitis B vaccine, the panel &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/downloads/agendas/draft-posted-2025-09-12-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;will also discuss&lt;/a&gt; and vote on recommendations for the combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine, and COVID vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pediatricians worry changes to the schedules of these vaccines will limit access for many families, because ACIP's recommendations generally determine whether insurance plans and federal programs pay for the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Typically, ACIP would undertake an analysis of the data before recommending a change to vaccine guidelines. As of the end of August, this process had not begun for the hepatitis B vaccines, Daskalakis and another former official said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"This is an atypical situation. There's been no work group to discuss it," Daskalakis said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The second former official spoke to NPR and KFF Health News on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In an email, a Health and Human Services spokesman, Andrew Nixon, wrote, "ACIP exists to ensure that vaccine policy is guided by the best available evidence and open scientific deliberation. Any updates to recommendations will be made transparently with gold standard science."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The draft agenda for the upcoming ACIP meeting was released to the public Sunday, only a few days before the meetings are scheduled to begin.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;At the last ACIP meeting in June, chairman Martin Kulldorff, one of the new members handpicked by Kennedy, questioned the need to vaccinate every newborn, citing only two of the many ways the virus can spread.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-88955" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Kulldorff is a former Harvard Medical School professor who became known for opposing some &lt;a href="https://gbdeclaration.org/" target="_blank"&gt;public health measures&lt;/a&gt; during the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Unless the mother is hepatitis B positive, an argument could be made to delay the vaccine for this infection, which is primarily spread by sexual activity and intravenous drug use," Kulldorff said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The infection requires direct exposure to infected bodily fluids like blood and semen. The disease has no cure and can lead to serious conditions like cirrhosis and liver cancer later in life. The CDC advisory panel may maintain the recommendation to inoculate newborns whose mothers are considered at high risk of the disease, the former officials said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Protection From Birth&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5125a3.htm?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=transaction#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20acute%20disease,HBV%20infection%20must%20be%20expanded." target="_blank"&gt;1991&lt;/a&gt;, federal health officials determined it was advisable for newborns to receive their first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/global-immunization/stories/hepatitis-b-birth-dose-vaccination-in-africa.html#:~:text=Key%20points%20*%20Mother%2Dto%2Dchild%20transmission%20is%20the,hours%20of%20life%2C%20can%20prevent%20mother%2Dto%2Dchild%20transmission." target="_blank"&gt;24 hours of birth&lt;/a&gt;, which blocks the virus from taking hold if transmitted during delivery. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While parents may opt out of the shots, many daycare centers and school districts &lt;a href="https://www.immunize.org/wp-content/uploads/laws/hepb-ccsch-rqt-map-2025.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;require proof&lt;/a&gt; of hepatitis B vaccination for enrollment.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The prospect of altering the recommendation has left some people living with the virus deeply unsettled.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I am goddamn frustrated," said &lt;a href="https://wendylo.com/#about" target="_blank"&gt;Wendy Lo&lt;/a&gt;, 52, who lives in the San Francisco Bay area. Lo says she has probably had hepatitis B since birth. Years of navigating the psychological, monetary, medical and social aspects of chronic hepatitis B has impacted almost every aspect of her life.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I would not want anyone to have to experience that if it can be prevented," she said. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lo only learned she had the disease due to a routine screening in order to study abroad in college as a young adult. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lo credits the vaccines with protecting all the members of her close family from infection.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I shared with my partner, 'if you get vaccinated, we can be together,'" she said. He got the vaccine, which protects him from infection, "so I'm grateful for that," she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The CDC estimates half of people with hepatitis B &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/about/index.html#:~:text=Although%20HBV%20can%20be%20found,breastfeeding%2C%20or%20food%20or%20water." target="_blank"&gt;do not know&lt;/a&gt; they are infected. It can range from an acute, mild infection to a chronic infection, often with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/hcp/clinical-signs/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;few or no symptoms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most people with chronic hepatitis B were born outside of the U.S. Asians and Pacific Islanders, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/statistics/2020surveillance/hepatitis-b/table-2.6.htm" target="_blank"&gt;followed by&lt;/a&gt; Black people, have the highest rates of newly reported chronic infections.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When her children were born, Lo was adamant that they receive the newborn dose, a decision she says prevented them from contracting the virus.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The earlier an infection occurs, the worse the lifetime consequences, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/perinatal-hepb/downloads/HepB-Provider-tipsheet-508.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;. When contracted in infancy or early childhood, hepatitis B is far more likely to become a chronic infection, silently damaging the liver over decades.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Those who become chronic carriers can also unknowingly spread the virus to others and face an increased risk of long-term complications including cirrhosis and liver cancer, which may not become evident until much later in life.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Treatments like the antivirals Lo now takes weren't available until the 1990s. Decades of the virus replicating unchecked damaged her liver. Every six months she gets scared of what her blood tests may reveal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Now I'm in my 50s, one of my big concerns is liver cancer. The vaccine is safe and effective, it's life-saving, and it protects you against cancer. How many vaccines do that?&lt;em&gt;" &lt;/em&gt;Lo said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Thirty Years of Universal Vaccination&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After a vaccine was approved in the 1980s, public health officials initially focused vaccination efforts on so-called "high-risk" adults.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;I, and every other doctor, had been trained in medical school to think of hepatitis B as an infection you acquired as an adult. It was the pimps, the prostitutes, the prisoners, and the healthcare practitioners who got hepatitis B infection. But we've learned so much more," said &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-policy/person/william-schaffner-md" target="_blank"&gt;William Schaffner&lt;/a&gt;, professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and a &lt;a href="https://www.nfid.org/person/william-schaffner-md/" target="_blank"&gt;former voting member &lt;/a&gt;of ACIP.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As hepatitis B rates remained stubbornly high in the 1980s, scientists realized an entire vulnerable group was missing from the vaccination regime – newborns. The virus is often&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/prevention/index.html#cdc_prevention_pop-who-is-at-risk" target="_blank"&gt; spread&lt;/a&gt; from an infected mother to baby in late pregnancy or during birth.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We may soon hear 'let's just do a blood test on all pregnant women.' We tried that. That doesn't work perfectly either," Shaffner said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Some doctors didn't test, he said, and some pregnant women falsely tested negative, while others acquired hepatitis B later in pregnancy, after they had already been tested. In 1991, Schaffner was a liaison member to the ACIP group that voted to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00033405.htm" target="_blank"&gt;recommend universal vaccination&lt;/a&gt; for hepatitis B before an infant leaves the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;We want no babies infected. Therefore, we'll just vaccinate every mom and every baby at birth. Problem solved. It has been brilliantly successful in virtually eliminating hepatitis B in children," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;In 1990, there were 3.03 cases of hepatitis B per 100,000 in those 19 years old and under in the U.S., according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since the federal recommendation to vaccinate all infants, cases have dramatically decreased. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-surveillance-2022/hepatitis-b/figure-2-4.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC data&lt;/a&gt; shows that in 2022, the rate of cases among those ages 19 was less than 0.1 per 100,000.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;While hepatitis B is often associated with high-risk behaviors such as injected drug use or multiple sexual partners, &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/vaccine-education-center/vaccine-details/hepatitis-b-vaccine#:~:text=How%20do%20you%20catch%20hepatitis,through%20air%2C%20food%20or%20water." target="_blank"&gt;health experts&lt;/a&gt; caution that it is possible for the virus to be transmitted in ordinary situations, especially among young children.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The virus can survive for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/rr/rr6701a1.htm#:~:text=Introduction,is%20provided%20(Box%201)." target="_blank"&gt;up to seven days&lt;/a&gt; outside the body. During that time, even microscopic traces of infected blood on a &lt;a href="https://med.umich.edu/1libr/IMMS/RecommendHepBUM.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;school desk or playground equipment&lt;/a&gt; can pose a risk. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If the virus comes into contact with an open wound or the mucous membranes of the eyes, an infection can occur. This means that unvaccinated children who are not considered "high risk" can still be exposed in everyday environments.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Future Access Uncertain&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If the CDC significantly alters its recommendation, health insurers would no longer be required to cover the cost of the shot if given before the new recommended age. That could leave parents to pay out of pocket for a vaccine that has long been provided at no charge. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Children who get immunizations through the federal &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Vaccines for Children&lt;/a&gt; program would lose free access to the shot as soon as any new ACIP recommendations get approved by the acting CDC director.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The two former CDC officials said that plans were underway to push back the official recommendation for the vaccine as of August, when they both left the agency, but may have changed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Schaffner is still a liaison member of ACIP, and hopes to express his support for universal newborn vaccination at the next meeting.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The liaisons have now been excluded from the vaccine work groups. They are still permitted to attend the full meetings," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;He intends to speak up if he can, because he's worried about the next generation of babies and the doctors who care for them.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;We'll see cases of hepatitis B once again occur. We'll see transmission into the next generation," he said. "And the next generation of people who wear white coats will have to deal with hepatitis B, when we could have cut it off at the pass."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was produced in partnership with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/about-us/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF Health News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/about-us/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KFF&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NPR Health Correspondent Will Stone contributed to this story.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Parkinson's Disease affects around a million people in the United States, and that number is on the rise, in part because our population is getting older.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ucihealth.org/clinicians/claire-henchcliffe-1730276825" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Dr. Claire Henchcliffe&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the chair of neurology at the University of California, Irvine. She's one of the scientists at the forefront of Parkinson's research, and she says Parkinson's is the fastest growing out of the neurodegenerative disorders she deals with as a neurologist.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's very concerning that it's growing so quickly," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Parkinson's is a progressive disorder that causes difficulty with movement. But Henchcliffe says people also deal with symptoms that are harder to see, like memory, cognition problems, or onset of depression or anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;People are typically diagnosed around age 50 or 60, but the process of developing Parkinson's begins in the brain much earlier.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It may start 10, 15, 20 years before we ever pick up a tremor or ever see someone slow down," Henchcliffe says. "Sense of smell can alter, sleep can change … That's when the Parkinson's process in the brain has started. It's kicked off. But we don't have the wherewithal yet to be able to diagnose that process for sure."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Henchcliffe is one of many brain scientists working toward new treatment options for Parkinson's, including recent discoveries about the potential use of stem cells.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Science correspondent &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/people/2100615/jon-hamilton" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jon Hamilton&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; dives into this research — and even a future where scientists can prevent the disease altogether — on the show with Henchcliffe.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interested in more on the future of brain science?

&lt;p&gt;BAVINA SOOKDEO&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every year, thousands of families in Trinidad and Tobago are affected by sudden strokes, heart attacks and amputations – events often linked to one hidden culprit: vascular disease. According to Prof Vijay Naraynsingh, distinguished surgeon and researcher who works at Medical Associates Hospital, St Joseph, this condition quietly threatens lives across TT, but with awareness and prevention, many cases can be avoided. He spoke to the Newsday as the world observes Vascular Disease Awareness Month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naraynsingh explained that vascular really means vessels. “We’re talking about blood vessels or lymphatic vessels – arteries, veins and lymphatics. Lymphatics are the ones that carry fluid, but really arterial and venous are the two more common conditions. All the arteries and the veins will be part of our vascular speciality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a career spanning over 45 years, the doctor, likens the vascular system to a household piping network: “The heart pumps blood like water into your house. If there’s a blockage in a pipe, it affects where it’s going. A blockage to the brain can cause a stroke, to the heart – a heart attack, to the kidneys – kidney failure and to the legs – gangrene and amputation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to veins, varicose veins are the most common issue. However, as Naraynsingh pointed out, it’s the arteries that are far more dangerous. He noted that in TT, the leading cause of death is heart disease, followed closely by strokes – both of which are vascular conditions. “In the system of pipes, the pipes go bad with age. They can go bad with other things too (like smoking and with cholesterol issues) but by and large, the pipes degenerate with age,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1551210817264-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while these age-related changes are expected, lifestyle factors are accelerating the problem, making vascular disease an increasingly urgent concern. Naraynsingh warned that cases of vascular disease are on the rise, also driven by increasing rates of diabetes, obesity and hypertension – and worryingly, it is now appearing more often in younger people as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_1178430" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1178430" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img class="size-medium wp-image-1178430" src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/24386887-893x1024.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-1178430" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;-&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the surgeon, vascular disease is rarely confined to one area. “When you have vascular disease, it’s a multi-system disorder. You cannot have one pipe rusting and assume the rest are fine. If someone has heart disease, chances are they also have issues in their brain, kidneys, or limbs. It’s a generalised disease that just manifests in a particular organ at that time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naraynsingh further explained that when a patient goes to him with a stroke, he does not treat the stroke in isolation. After addressing the immediate issue, he also investigates for heart disease, kidney disease, lower limb disease and signs of generalised vascular disease, with the aim of controlling the condition across the entire system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emphasising that prevention is the best defence, Naraynsingh advised, “The easiest thing is to do your regular checks – blood pressure, sugar, lipids. When we see abnormalities even before symptoms appear, we can start preventative measures like losing weight, exercising (which everyone should be doing), stopping smoking and using medication if necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Screening, he added, is especially critical for those at higher risk. “If you are diabetic, you need fairly extensive checks – your heart, eyes, kidneys, carotids and lower limbs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for treatment, it varies depending on how the disease presents. “If the problem is diabetes or hypertension, we aim for tight control,” Naraynsingh explained. “If there’s vessel narrowing, we can use blood thinners like aspirin or Plavix, or medication to lower cholesterol.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surgical options have also evolved. Naraynsingh explained that surgery for vascular disease varies depending on severity and location. In the heart, the most common procedure is bypass surgery, but milder cases may only require angioplasty and stenting. In angioplasty, a wire is inserted into the narrowed vessel, and a balloon is inflated to widen it. If the vessel collapses again, a stent – “like a collapsible wire fence” – is placed to keep it open. Bypass surgery, on the other hand, leaves the blocked vessel in place but creates a new pathway, like laying a fresh pipe alongside a blocked one and joining it above and below the obstruction. For patients with strokes or reduced blood flow to the brain, surgeons often operate on the carotid artery in the neck, removing the plaque in a procedure called endarterectomy. For lower limb disease, both bypass surgery and angioplasty with stenting are common. Ultimately, he stressed, the technique depends on the extent, location, and number of blockages, since ‘a pipe doesn’t rust in just one spot – it rusts in many.’ There is no one-size-fits-all treatment; it must be tailored to each patient’s pattern of disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest barriers, Naraynsingh believes, is the lack of timely access to advanced care. “People don’t understand the value of what I call ‘snatch and run,’” he explained. If someone has chest pain, families often wait on an ambulance – which can take half an hour, an hour, or even longer – when in reality, no hospital in Trinidad is more than 20 to 30 minutes away. “While you’re waiting on the ambulance, the patient could die” he stressed. The most important thing is getting them to the hospital quickly. The bigger issue, he added, is what happens after arrival. In the entire public system, there is only one Cath lab (a hospital procedure room with specialised imaging equipment used to diagnose and treat heart conditions), located at Mount Hope and it is not a 24-hour service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1551381418315-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_1178432" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1178432" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-1178432" src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/24386885.jpg" alt=""&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-1178432" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Prof Vijay Naraynsingh -&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ideally, we should have at least two or three major hospitals equipped with trained personnel available 24/7 to handle emergencies the moment a patient arrives, because every minute lost means the heart muscle is dying.” The same urgency applies to strokes, where patients must receive treatment within four hours before brain tissue is irreversibly damaged. “Time is brain,” he stressed. “If you arrive too late, even if the clot is removed, the brain cells are already dead.” He noted that private Cath labs exist, but they remain prohibitively expensive for many patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His message during Vascular Disease Awareness Month is to “Get screened and do your regular checks. For diabetics especially, be vigilant and do extensive checks. We have not decreased our amputation rate in Trinidad and Tobago yet, and we need to work aggressively on that but it requires a multi-tiered approach.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At both a personal and national level, the fight against vascular disease comes down to prevention, awareness and timely care. “We really need to increase public awareness of how urgent the matter is. When somebody gets a heart attack or a stroke, you get them to an institution fast. Time is brain, time is heart,” the doctor warned.

&lt;figure id="article-featured-image" class="article-featured-image"&gt;&lt;img src="https://newsday.co.tt/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/23205080.jpg" alt="President of the TT Association of Psychologists, Kelly McFarlane. FILE PHOTO - "&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;President of the TT Association of Psychologists, Kelly McFarlane. FILE PHOTO - &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As World Suicide Prevention Day was observed on September 10, TT finds itself facing a stark reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Observatory Data Repository, this country ranks fifth in the Caribbean for suicide mortality rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against this troubling backdrop, president of the TT Association of Psychologists (TTAP), Kelly Mc Farlane, is sounding the alarm, especially for workers recently affected by sweeping job cuts in programmes like Cepep, the reforestation programme, and URP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These individuals, she warns, are particularly vulnerable to mental health challenges stemming from financial insecurity, identity disruption, and daily stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mc Farlane outlined several evidence-based strategies proven to help individuals cope with sudden unemployment and its psychological toll. She emphasised the importance of regulating the nervous system and maintaining a sense of control, starting with the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239531467-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the most effective tools is slow, diaphragmatic breathing, done two to three times a day,” she said. “It’s been shown to reduce cortisol levels and lower blood pressure, both of which spike under chronic stress. It trains the body to respond differently to stress over time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In tandem with breathing techniques, Mc Farlane recommends grounding practices and maintaining structured daily routines. Even without formal employment, she noted, people can benefit from creating consistency around meals, exercise, reading, job searches, or caring for family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This structure helps support your circadian rhythm, which plays a critical role in regulating mood.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another essential technique Mc Farlane highlighted is behavioural activation, which focuses on intentionally scheduling small, purposeful tasks to help re-engage with life after a setback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Losing a job certainly qualifies as a major life disruption. Even minor activities, like cleaning a room or applying for one job, can provide a sense of purpose and help guard against depression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But perhaps the most powerful buffer against emotional decline, she said, is human connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Social support is absolutely essential. We are wired to connect. Everyone needs at least one trusted person they can talk to, whether it’s a friend, a relative, or a peer. Just having someone to speak with regularly helps buffer the stress response.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Mc Farlane, these connections do more than offer comfort. They reduce biological markers associated with depression. She says it is not just psychological: it’s physiological.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Isolation worsens things, while connection heals.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="ad-manager-half-page-mobile-ad-300x600 ad-space-centered" id="div-gpt-ad-1550239585826-0"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also encouraged the use of cognitive reframing, a psychological technique that helps people view distressing situations through a more constructive lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cognitive reframing isn’t about pretending things are fine,” she explained. “It’s about acknowledging the reality but choosing a perspective that doesn’t add to your distress. That’s a powerful mental shift. You’re actively changing how your brain processes the situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mc Farlane said many affected workers live in the same communities and could benefit from peer support groups—informal spaces for shared listening, encouragement, and healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These can be very effective. They don’t have to be formal or expensive. It could be a group that meets in someone’s home, at a community centre, or on Zoom. What matters is creating a safe space to talk and be heard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She urged anyone feeling overwhelmed not to suffer in silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Symptoms can vary, but they often include persistent sadness, withdrawal from activities, and changes in sleep or appetite. If you’re experiencing these, especially as a parent trying to hold it all together, please reach out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognising many may now face financial strain, McFarlane highlighted several free resources available for those in need of help.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Ancient bones discovered in a cave in Vietnam could belong to one of the world's &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/shattered-skull-details-gruesome-final-moments-of-a-medieval-murder-victim"&gt;earliest known victims of homicide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An analysis of the bones and circumstances of his death suggests that the man, aged around 35 years at the time of his death, some 12,000 years ago, died at the hands of another human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If so, it would be the earliest known case of interpersonal violence in Southeast Asia, says a team led by archaeologist Christopher Stimpson of Oxford University in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/south-american-mummies-were-brutally-murdered-ct-scans-reveal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;South American Mummies Were Brutally Murdered, CT Scans Reveal&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174262" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174262" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/skull-reconstructed.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-174262" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/skull-reconstructed.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/skull-reconstructed-370x415.jpg 370w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/skull-reconstructed-600x674.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174262" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The skull was in pieces and had to be put back together like a puzzle. (C. M. Stimpson)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bones were excavated in the archaeological site in a cave called Thung Binh 1 in the Tràng An Landscape Complex World Heritage Site between December 2017 and April 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although his skull was crushed in his grave – damage that occurred post mortem – the man, named TBH1, appeared to have been local to the region and died in good health, initial analysis of his bones suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since people in good health don't generally tend to drop dead, this was a little curious. Then the mystery deepened. An examination of the man's neck revealed two surprising things: first, he had a cervical rib, an extra rib seen in around one percent of people; and second, there was a quartz point in the sediment in which the man was interred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On closer inspection, the researchers found that the quartz point had been deliberately worked, probably as a projectile. Also, it wasn't local stone by a long shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It doesn't match any other stone tools from Thung Binh 1 or nearby sites, raising questions about who made it and where it came from," &lt;a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/press-office/press-releases/ancient-cave-discovery-points-to-southeast-asia-s-earliest-human.html"&gt;says archaeologist Benjamin Utting&lt;/a&gt; of the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking more closely at the bones, the researchers were able to piece together a likely sequence of events. One of the man's cervical ribs showed signs of fracture, but also infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stimpson and his colleague believe the man was struck by a stone-tipped projectile in his neck, where it lodged after damaging his rib. Infection then set into the wound, and the man sickened and died several days to weeks after the attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174265" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174265" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/fracture.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-174265" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/fracture.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/fracture-600x314.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174265" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The fracture trauma from multiple angles (left) and the stone point (right).

People buried in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jebel_Sahaba"&gt;Jebel Sahaba cemetery&lt;/a&gt; dating back 13,000 years show heavy signs of interpersonal damage, for example. &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-famous-iceman-tzi-is-not-who-we-thought-he-was"&gt;Ötzi the Iceman&lt;/a&gt; was murdered in the Italian Alps &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00414-025-03510-5"&gt;5,300 years ago&lt;/a&gt;.

Credit: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep may enhance the brain’s ability to remove harmful waste. Poor or disrupted sleep could raise dementia risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain possesses its own system for removing waste, known as the &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00031.2020"&gt;glymphatic system&lt;/a&gt;, which is believed to become more active during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When sleep is disrupted, this cleaning process may be impaired, slowing the removal of toxins and other waste products from the brain. &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abb8739"&gt;Researchers suggest&lt;/a&gt; that the accumulation of such toxins due to inadequate sleep could contribute to a higher risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty remains about how exactly the glymphatic system functions in humans, as much of the current evidence comes from mouse studies. Still, these findings raise the possibility that better sleep could enhance the clearance of harmful substances in the brain and thereby lower dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what researchers currently understand about this developing field of study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Why waste matters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All cells in the body generate waste. Outside the brain, the lymphatic system removes this material by carrying it from the spaces between cells into the bloodstream through a network of vessels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain, however, lacks its own lymphatic vessels. Until about 12 years ago, scientists did not know how the brain handled its waste. That changed with the discovery of the glymphatic system, which was described as a mechanism that “&lt;a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/46/18190"&gt;flushes out&lt;/a&gt;” toxins from the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/cerebrospinal-fluid"&gt;Cerebrospinal fluid&lt;/a&gt;, which surrounds both the brain and spinal cord, plays a central role in this process. The fluid flows around blood vessels in the brain, then moves into the spaces between brain cells, where it collects waste before draining out through large veins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies in mice later demonstrated that the glymphatic system becomes most active &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1241224"&gt;during sleep&lt;/a&gt;, with waste removal markedly increased at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the substances cleared through this system is amyloid beta (Aβ) protein. When Aβ builds up in the brain, it can form plaques. Alongside tangles of another protein, tau, found in neurons, these plaques are key features of &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/whats-the-difference-between-alzheimers-and-dementia-225271"&gt;&lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="cmtt_44d955d660610a76fe199b3479668107" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/span&gt; disease, the most common form of dementia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In humans and mice, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1180962"&gt;studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; that levels of Aβ detected in the cerebrospinal fluid increase when awake and then rapidly fall during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more recently, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-024-01638-y"&gt;another study&lt;/a&gt; (in mice) showed pretty much the opposite – suggesting the glymphatic system is more active in the daytime. Researchers are debating what might explain the findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we still have some way to go before we can say exactly how the glymphatic system works – in mice or humans – to clear the brain of toxins that might otherwise increase the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Does this happen in humans too?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know sleeping well is good for us, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn.2017.55"&gt;particularly our brain health&lt;/a&gt;. We are all aware of the short-term effects of sleep deprivation on our brain’s ability to function, and we know &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/physrev.00054.2024"&gt;sleep helps improve memory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one experiment, a single night of complete sleep deprivation in healthy adults &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1721694115"&gt;increased the amount&lt;/a&gt; of Aβ in the hippocampus, an area of the brain implicated in Alzheimer’s disease. This suggests sleep can influence the clearance of Aβ from the human brain, supporting the idea that the human glymphatic system is more active while we sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also raises the question of whether good sleep might lead to better clearance of toxins such as Aβ from the brain, and so be a potential target to prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;How about sleep apnea or insomnia?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is less clear is what long-term disrupted sleep, for instance if someone has a sleep disorder, means for the body’s ability to clear Aβ from the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/sleep-disorders/obstructive-sleep-apnoea"&gt;Sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt; is a common sleep disorder when someone’s breathing stops multiple times as they sleep. This can lead to chronic (long-term) sleep deprivation, and reduced oxygen in the blood. Both may be implicated in the accumulation of toxins in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep apnea has also been linked with an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13589"&gt;increased risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;. And we now know that after people are treated for sleep apnea &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsx011"&gt;more Aβ is cleared from the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sleephealthfoundation.org.au/sleep-disorders/insomnia-2"&gt;Insomnia&lt;/a&gt; is when someone has difficulty falling asleep and/or staying asleep. When this happens in the long term, there’s also an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0318814"&gt;increased risk of dementia&lt;/a&gt;. However, we don’t know the effect of treating insomnia on toxins associated with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So again, it’s still too early to say for sure that treating a sleep disorder reduces your risk of dementia because of reduced levels of toxins in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;So where does this leave us?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collectively, these studies suggest enough good quality sleep is important for a healthy brain, and in particular for clearing toxins associated with dementia from the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we still don’t know if &lt;em&gt;treating&lt;/em&gt; a sleep disorder or improving sleep more broadly affects the brain’s ability to remove toxins, and whether this reduces the risk of dementia. It’s an area researchers, including us, are actively working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, we’re investigating the &lt;a href="https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/projects/understanding-brain-cleaning-in-obstructive-sleep-apnoea"&gt;concentration of Aβ and tau measured in blood&lt;/a&gt; across the 24-hour sleep-wake cycle in people with sleep apnea, on and off treatment, to better understand how sleep apnea affects brain cleaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers are also looking into the potential for treating insomnia with a class of drugs &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44323-025-00025-5"&gt;known as orexin receptor antagonists&lt;/a&gt; to see if this affects the &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06823752"&gt;clearance of Aβ from the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;If you’re concerned&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an emerging field and we don’t yet have all the answers about the link between &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-dangerous-is-insomnia-how-fear-of-what-its-doing-to-your-body-can-wreck-your-sleep-212248"&gt;disrupted sleep and dementia&lt;/a&gt;, or whether better sleep can boost the glymphatic system and so prevent cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you are concerned about your sleep or cognition, please see your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Deep-brain structures like the basal ganglia or the thalamus wield major influence on our behavior. If something goes awry, dysregulation in the deep brain may trigger neurological conditions &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/parkinsons-disease-could-be-ignited-by-burned-out-brain-cells"&gt;like Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brain-scans-identify-six-distinct-types-of-depression-and-anxiety"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the clear importance of these structures, our knowledge about them remains limited by their location, making&lt;span&gt; them difficult to study and treat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a new study, researchers unveil a device that might offer an alternative to invasive procedures. Featuring a novel ultrasound helmet, it not only modulates deep-brain circuits without surgery, but reportedly can do so with unrivaled precision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/ultrasound-can-probe-deep-into-the-brain-to-relieve-pain"&gt;Ultrasound Can Probe Deep Into The Brain to Relieve Pain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology represents a leap forward in our ability to study and influence the deep brain, says senior author Bradley Treeby, a biomedical engineer at University College London (UCL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This advance opens up opportunities for both neuroscience research and clinical treatment. For the first time, scientists can non-invasively study causal relationships in deep-brain circuits that were previously only accessible through surgery," Treeby &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2025-09-09-new-ultrasound-helmet-enables-deep-brain-stimulation-people-without-surgery"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clinically, this new technology could transform treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders like  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="174012" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; disease,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="174012" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, and essential tremor," he &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2025-09-09-new-ultrasound-helmet-enables-deep-brain-stimulation-people-without-surgery"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;, "offering unprecedented precision in targeting specific brain circuits that play key roles in these conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new system builds on existing methods like transcranial ultrasound stimulation and MRI-guided focused ultrasound, but it's designed to address limitations of each, such as the former's low focal precision and the latter's need for stabilizing skull screws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new helmet can target areas in the brain 1,000 times smaller than conventional ultrasound devices can, and 30 times smaller than similar technologies that specifically target deeper areas of the brain, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does this using an array of 256 elements configured on the helmet's interior, which emit focused ultrasound beams at specific areas of the wearer's brain to raise or reduce neuronal activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_174338" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174338" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ultrasound_helmet_642.jpg" alt="breakdown of ultrasound helmet" class="wp-image-174338 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ultrasound_helmet_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ultrasound_helmet_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/09/ultrasound_helmet_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-174338" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;A schematic of the ultrasound helmet.

Functional  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="174012" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;magnetic resonance imaging&lt;/a&gt; (fMRI) scans showed a simultaneous surge of activity in the visual cortex, suggesting the LGN was successfully hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This real-time monitoring capability is an important feature, says first author Eleanor Martin, a physicist and engineer in UCL's Biomedical Ultrasound Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We designed the system to be compatible with simultaneous fMRI, enabling us to monitor the effects of stimulation in real time," she &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2025-09-09-new-ultrasound-helmet-enables-deep-brain-stimulation-people-without-surgery"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;. "This opens up exciting possibilities for closed-loop neuromodulation and personalised therapies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another experiment demonstrated the durability of the helmet's effects, with changes in visual cortex activity continuing for 40 minutes after stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subjects reported no conscious perception of any visual changes during these tests, the researchers note, yet  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/magnetic-resonance-imaging" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73063" data-postid="174012" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;fMRI scans&lt;/a&gt; nonetheless revealed significant and persistent shifts in neural activity at the intended locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ability to precisely modulate deep-brain structures without surgery represents a paradigm shift in neuroscience, offering a safe, reversible, and repeatable method for both understanding brain function and developing targeted therapies," Treeby &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2025-09-09-new-ultrasound-helmet-enables-deep-brain-stimulation-people-without-surgery"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/smart-brain-implants-can-now-adapt-to-optimize-parkinsons-treatment"&gt;Smart Brain Implants Can Now Adapt to Optimize Parkinson's Treatment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research is needed to fully explain what's happening in this process, the researchers point out, but these results already amount to a breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such deft neuromodulation was previously impossible without invasive methods, and it offers new hope for patients with certain conditions, says co-author and clinical neuroscientist Ioana Grigoras from the University of Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are particularly excited about its potential clinical applications for neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, where deep-brain regions are especially affected," Grigoras &lt;a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2025-09-09-new-ultrasound-helmet-enables-deep-brain-stimulation-people-without-surgery"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-63020-1"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Cyclists tend to do some pretty weird and wonderful things in the hope of improving performance. We’ll try any supplement or diet trend with even the faintest promise of improvement, we’ll tinker with and tweak our bikes until the cows come home, and we’ll try all sorts of strange tech in the hope of accessing even the most marginal of gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what about shining a bunch of light through your skull and up your nose, into your brain, all in the hope of improving time trial performance? Yep, you read that right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-pbm"&gt;What is PBM?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you might be able to tell from the name, photobiomodulation (or PBM) is a technique that involves shining light into the body in order to stimulate various effects. The light used is in the red to near-infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum – normally with wavelengths between 600 and 1,100 nm – and depending on what sort of tissue you point that light at, it can generate a range of different outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Point it at muscle tissue and it’s possible to &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2411-5142/8/4/144?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;induce an increase in oxygen demand&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which can ultimately lead to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-022-01714-y?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;improved performance in time-to-exhaustion tests&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Directing it at the muscles also seems to help with the repair of those muscles, due to a &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/ajpmr/abstract/2014/12000/effects_of_low_level_laser_therapy_on_skeletal.7.aspx?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;“reduction in the inflammatory process”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And it turns out that transcranial PBM – that is, firing those infrared lights through your skull and into your brain cells – can both &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4409/13/11/966?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;enhance cognitive abilities in healthy brains&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and also has some potential when it comes to treating neurodegenerative conditions &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0278412&amp;amp;ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;including Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how does it work exactly? To simplify a &lt;a href="https://soterixmedical.com/research/tpbm?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;rather complex process&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the absorption of infrared light within the brain cells seems to lead to increased blood flow in the brain, in addition to enhanced hemoglobin oxygenation (you might recall that hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the body’s tissues). These factors, in turn, lead to increased activation of the brain areas targeted by the PBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxygenation levels in the brain are also relevant if we’re talking about exercise performance. Various studies have shown that a &lt;a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00909.2014?ref=escapecollective.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;drop in cerebral oxygenation during high-intensity exercise is associated with exhaustion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and that deoxygenation of the prefrontal cortex in particular seems to contribute to “the cessation of exercise” during controlled and self-paced efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if there’s a link between oxygenation levels in the brain and exercise performance, could it be that &lt;em&gt;increasing&lt;/em&gt; oxygenation in the brain – via a technique like PBM – might help improve cycling performance?&lt;/p&gt;
