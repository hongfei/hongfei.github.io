They’ve revived a cultural fervor for thinness that has been blamed for everything from &lt;a href="https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2025/01/ozempic-partly-to-blame-for-wine-bar-closure-says-owner/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the closure of wine bars&lt;/a&gt; to killing off &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/08/ozempic-weight-loss-body-positivity" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the body positivity movement&lt;/a&gt;. What began as a seeming miracle drug posited to help those most in need of losing weight for health reasons has led to a clamor in which &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/10/health/ozempic-glp-1-survey-kff/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one in eight Americans have tried the drugs&lt;/a&gt; and telehealth companies have offered cheaper off-brand versions with very little oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Ozempic (the brand name for semaglutide) and other GLP-1s mimic a natural hormone in the body, stimulating insulin and slowing the rate of stomach emptying after eating, increasing one’s sense of fullness. But the very qualities that make GLP-1s such powerful tools for weight loss also make them potentially dangerous for those who struggle to adequately feed themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"society","tags":[{"id":"society/eating-disorders","type":"Keyword","title":"Eating disorders"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","type":"Keyword","title":"Health &amp;amp; wellbeing"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"society/mental-health","type":"Keyword","title":"Mental health"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","type":"Keyword","title":"Life and style"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","type":"Keyword","title":"US news"},{"id":"science/drugs","type":"Keyword","title":"Drugs"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"profile/hannah-seo","type":"Contributor","title":"Hannah Seo"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-features","type":"Tracking","title":"US Features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/east-coast-features","type":"Tracking","title":"East coast features"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"society/2025/apr/04/ozempic-semaglutide-eating-disorders","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","switches":{"lightbox":true,"prebidCriteo":true,"externalVideoEmbeds":true,"personaliseSignInGateAfterCheckout":true,"abSignInGateMainVariant":true,"prebidAppnexusUkRow":true,"prebidMagnite":true,"commercialMetrics":true,"prebidTrustx":true,"scAdFreeBanner":false,"adaptiveSite":true,"prebidPermutiveAudience":true,"compareVariantDecision":false,"enableSentryReporting":true,"lazyLoadContainers":true,"ampArticleSwitch":false,"remarketing":true,"articleEndSlot":true,"keyEventsCarousel":true,"registerWithPhone":false,"darkModeWeb":true,"targeting":true,"remoteHeader":true,"slotBodyEnd":true,"ampPrebidOzone":false,"extendedMostPopularFronts":true,"emailInlineInFooter":true,"showNewPrivacyWordingOnEmailSignupEmbeds":true,"prebidAnalytics":true,"extendedMostPopular":true,"ampContentAbTesting":false,"imrWorldwide":true,"acast":true,"twitterUwt":true,"abAuxiaSignInGate":true,"abDeferPermutiveLoad":true,"prebidAppnexusInvcode":true,"ampPrebidPubmatic":false,"a9HeaderBidding":true,"prebidAppnexus":true,"enableDiscussionSwitch":true,"prebidXaxis":true,"stickyVideos":true,"interactiveFullHeaderSwitch":true,"discussionAllPageSize":true,"prebidUserSync":true,"audioOnwardJourneySwitch":true,"brazeTaylorReport":false,"callouts":true,"sentinelLogger":true,"geoMostPopular":true,"weAreHiring":false,"relatedContent":true,"thirdPartyEmbedTracking":true,"prebidOzone":true,"ampLiveblogSwitch":false,"ampAmazon":false,"prebidAdYouLike":true,"mostViewedFronts":true,"optOutAdvertising":true,"abSignInGateMainControl":true,"googleSearch":true,"brazeSwitch":true,"prebidKargo":true,"consentManagement":true,"idProfileNavigation":true,"confiantAdVerification":true,"discussionAllowAnonymousRecommendsSwitch":false,"absoluteServerTimes":false,"permutive":true,"comscore":true,"ampPrebidCriteo":false,"prebidTheTradeDesk":true,"newsletterOnwards":false,"youtubeIma":true,"webFonts":true,"liveBlogTopSponsorship":true,"ophan":true,"crosswordSvgThumbnails":true,"prebidTriplelift":true,"prebidPubmatic":true,"serverShareCounts":false,"autoRefresh":true,"enhanceTweets":true,"prebidIndexExchange":true,"prebidOpenx":true,"prebidHeaderBidding":true,"idCookieRefresh":true,"discussionPageSize":true,"smartAppBanner":false,"historyTags":true,"brazeContentCards":true,"remoteBanner":true,"emailSignupRecaptcha":true,"prebidSmart":true,"shouldLoadGoogletag":true,"inizio":true,"europeBetaFront":true,"prebidBidCache":false},"contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some healthcare specialists say that an injection enabling people to eat dramatically fewer calories in a day resembles nothing less than a drug-induced – or at least, a drug-encouraged – eating disorder. Dr Kimberly Dennis, a psychiatrist and expert on eating disorders in the US, is quoted as saying: “&lt;a href="https://x.com/PiersUncensored/status/1795900668609282367" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;These drugs are rocket fuel for people with eating disorders&lt;/a&gt;.” Another doctor told Bloomberg News directly that they had seen patients with &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-12-16/weight-loss-drugs-are-too-easily-prescribed-to-people-with-anorexia?embedded-checkout=true#:~:text=one%20doctor%20calls-,%E2%80%9CGLP%2D1%20induced%E2%80%9D%20anorexia,-after%20taking%20shots" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;“drug-induced” anorexia&lt;/a&gt;. For people who are prone to anorexia, bulimia and other eating disorders, easy access to GLP-1s is causing alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="9eab2a1b-557c-434e-a5ab-1113f1decea2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":3,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"How I escaped the wild west of #cleaneating Instagram and TikTok","elementId":"9eab2a1b-557c-434e-a5ab-1113f1decea2","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/dec/16/food-nutrition-misinformation-social-media"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Many healthcare professionals are concerned that those with &lt;em&gt;restrictive&lt;/em&gt; eating disorders should not be on appetite-suppressant drugs, says Pamela Keel, a psychologist and eating disorder expert at Florida State University. She says medications should not be being prescribed to help a malnourished person stay malnourished, regardless of their weight. After all, “we are not interested in helping people do a better job of having an eating disorder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;GLP-1s not only make it easier to restrict consumption by suppressing appetite, they could also encourage other disordered behavior such as purging. Because the stomach empties more slowly on these drugs, it can make it easier to vomit up food, says Keel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A good doctor would be aware of a patient’s history of eating disorders and would be able to take those risk factors into account. However, GLP-1s are increasingly easy to access through telehealth platforms like Hers, Eden and Ro, which only require online consultations. To see just how easy it would be to lie about my own health and my need for these drugs, I went on the website of one well-known telehealth platform. I went through the various intake forms and surveys, telling the truth about my health in all instances but over-reporting my weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I was quickly approved and charged for compounded semaglutide. At no point was I put in contact with any kind of doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="b68de5a5-f832-482b-abf7-425aadd628ba" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A banner advertises Ozempic for weight loss in West Virginia.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The interactions between Ozempic and eating disorders are complex. There are concerns that drug could retrigger a restrictive eating disorder in someone diagnosed with one previously, or even trigger one in someone who hadn’t had one before. Complicating matters is that there is evidence to suggest that Ozempic can be helpful to people with binge eating disorder, and many people who cycle between patterns of restrictive eating and overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Because these drugs are still so new, there’s no longitudinal data on how they affect eating disorders in the long term. One theory of how anorexia is triggered is that calorie restriction and “starvation mode” flips a metaphorical switch in the brain of those who are predisposed, says Terry Schwartz, interim executive director of the Eating Disorders Center for Treatment and Research at the University of California, San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s not yet known whether GLP-1s can flip this switch, but there is a medical precedent for this, Schwartz says. The anti-seizure medication Topamax (also known by its generic drug name, topiramate) has side effects of weight loss and suppressed appetite. We now know that this drug can &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25847809/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increase the risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing an eating disorder. “I saw a number of people … who developed a syndrome like anorexia nervosa on Topamax,” Schwartz says – disordered behaviors that disappeared once they stopped the drug. And this is something scientists are considering as they continue to monitor and study GLP-1s and their effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There is more consensus that these drugs could trigger a relapse in someone who has already suffered from disordered eating. At the age of 30, Lily, a retail worker in Australia, found that climbing even just a few stairs had her pausing to catch her breath. Her body mass had swelled in recent years, but she had put off seeing the doctor even as her fatigue grew heavier and heavier. Even when she started wetting herself she still found it hard to see the severity of her symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;People will never be able to accept their bodies, they’ll always be told, ‘Well, you could be thinner, just use this medicine’&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When she finally went to the doctor in June 2023, Lily was stunned to hear her diagnosis of adult-onset type 1 diabetes. She knew she had been unhealthy, gaining 70kg in the past five years, having developed some binge eating tendencies. But for most of her life, Lily had actually been unhealthily underweight. It seemed unreal that she could develop diabetes so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;To get her diabetes under control, she was told she needed the help of a GLP-1 drug. She told her endocrinologist that she’d had anorexia for over a decade and felt that suppressing her appetite was a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“He did not give two shits, excuse my language,” Lily says. And so, against the advice of her long-term psychiatrist and dietician, Lily was put on Ozempic. She relapsed immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In Lily’s case, she was lucky that a friend noticed her symptoms and urged her to tell her psychiatrist. Though she is still technically overweight, her psychiatrist helped her pivot to simply maintaining her current weight, which has helped Lily pull herself out of her relapse. She stopped losing weight and stopped weighing herself. She regularly checks in with both her psychiatrist and her dietician to make sure she’s eating enough, even while she remains on Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Lily’s feelings toward Ozempic are complicated. Her blood sugars are down and her cholesterol is at a better place. In contrast to her previous “all-or-nothing” mindset with food, she’s able to eat “normal” meal portions for the first time in her adult life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The Ozempic keeps her urges to binge at bay, she says, and now she doubts whether she can ever go off it. When a hernia repair surgery forced her to pause her Ozempic usage for about a month in June 2024, the ferocity of her returning appetite scared her. “All of my thoughts about food came back exactly the way that they were before, and it was horrifying,” she says. “I felt so out of control and I was miserable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Lily, like many people with eating disorders that don’t fit into neat boxes, is wedged between an urge to binge that is tempered by the Ozempic and the impulse to restrict that the Ozempic enables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="food-noise-and-binge-eating" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;‘Food noise’ and binge eating&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Though anorexia nervosa is probably the most well-known eating disorder, binge eating disorder, which causes compulsive and chronic overeating, is about four times more common in girls and women of all ages than anorexia nervosa and twice as common as bulimia nervosa, according to a comprehensive &lt;a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/striped/report-economic-costs-of-eating-disorders/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Harvard report&lt;/a&gt;. The potential for GLP-1s to help those with binge eating disorder is a source of some optimism. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37990682/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has started to come out over the past couple years &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214623724000048" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;suggesting&lt;/a&gt; that these drugs could be a valuable tool to curb binges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;GLP-1 is a natural hormone in the body that spikes when we eat a meal. In-progress research suggests that GLP-1 responses are blunted or muted in people with a history of binging, says Keel, so it’s possible these medications could help rebalance their hormone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Megan, a 39-year-old nurse in Jersey City, New Jersey, sought out Ozempic in May of 2023 after struggling with cycles of binging and purging for all of her adult life. She eventually switched to Mounjaro, and the change for her has been dramatic. Before she started taking GLP-1s, Megan would get hunger pangs throughout the day that would consume her mind and affect her body. She would wake up in the middle of the night from the discomfort – and the urges wouldn’t settle until she got up to eat food from the fridge. With GLP-1s all of that went away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a48cc3e4-5c50-49db-9de5-2fd4e61a4fde" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Advertising for semaglutide injections outside Penn Station in New York in 2024.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Richard Levine/Alamy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Experiencing physical discomfort driving her to binge, and then relief that the medication provided, Megan realized how much of her disorder was a biological condition, and not just a matter of discipline. “I thought it was a willpower issue and I always blamed myself,” Megan says. But all this has “made me forgive myself for what I went through”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;We’ve already seen that GLP-1s reduce “food noise” and people’s preoccupations with eating, so “for somebody who has binge eating disorder, these could be helpful tools,” says Leslie Heinberg, a Cleveland Clinic psychologist and expert in obesity and eating disorders. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37990682/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Preliminary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214623724000048" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; do show that these drugs hold promise in reducing binge eating behaviors, but more research is needed, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="control-and-shame" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Control and shame&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The idea that we need to tame our bodies to be thin dates back to at least the Enlightenment, with distinctly racist roots. It can be traced back to the idea that those in bigger bodies lack self-control and refinement, says Sabrina Strings, a professor of Black studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara who studies portrayals of gender, race and bodies. GLP-1s, she says, provide a medicalized avenue for that control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Control and shame, coincidentally, feature strongly in the mindsets of those with eating disorders, notes Debra Safer, a psychiatrist at Stanford’s medical weight loss clinic. The tension between semaglutides and body acceptance is palpable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This was true for Morgan, a 27-year-old marketing project manager in Chicago. After spending most of her life unhappy in her body and struggling with disordered eating, Morgan began therapy in 2022 where she learned about the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; At Every Size framework, which teaches people to strive for optimal health without focusing on size or weight. Even after a lot of unlearning unhealthy mindsets and learning to appreciate her body, Morgan eventually decided that Wegovy was the right choice for her. “It’s been kind of earth-shattering to admit to myself that it could be something that helps me,” she says. Her decision has sometimes felt like a betrayal of her values, but the relief the medication has brought her is undeniable – her joint pain has been reduced and the noise around food has been reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Lurking underneath the whole conversation of GLP-1s and eating disorders is the difficult truth that cultural fatphobia contributes to the prevalence of eating disorders, says Maria Rago, a psychologist in Illinois and the president of the board of directors for the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders. There are many people who are against these drugs because of how they contribute to the idea that we can and should all be thin, she says – there’s a fear that this will contribute to more eating disorders, and that “people will never be able to accept their bodies, they’ll always be told, ‘Well, you could be thinner, just use this medicine.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For now, what clinicians can do is what most of them are already doing: screening patients for a history of eating disorders before prescribing GLP-1s. If a patient has an active eating disorder they’ll be sent to treat that first, says Chika Anekwe, an obesity medicine physician at Massachusetts General hospital and an instructor of medicine at Harvard University. But if a patient has just a history of restrictive eating disorder, that won’t necessarily disqualify them from GLP-1 use. It’s a case by case assessment of “do the benefits outweigh the potential risk?” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Lily thinks her doctors “should have been more careful when they prescribed it to me,” she says. “I know that I had diabetes, and that my diabetes was really bad and that I was very sick, but I think they should have been more careful when they prescribed it to me.” Ultimately, however, she is grateful to be on Ozempic. The thought of trying to rein in her binge eating disorder without Ozempic feels scarier to her than what she’s doing now, managing her restrictive impulses while on it. And swirled in with all of this is the misplaced shame and embarrassment of needing to be on Ozempic in the first place, of having lost control to the point of needing medical intervention.

The woman on the other end of the line was quiet for a moment, then said: “OK, I’ll go, but I don’t need an ambulance. I have a friend who can take me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The 73-year-old woman called her closest neighbor, who lived a half a mile down the road in the rural village Salisbury, Conn. They talked every day, and she had described how tired she felt lately. Her friend encouraged her to call her doctor, even offered several times to take her to the emergency room at nearby Sharon Hospital. The woman always declined — I think I’m feeling better, she would say. But now even she had to acknowledge that she did not look or feel like the person she’d been — someone who, until she retired two years earlier, taught science to rowdy middle schoolers. Finally, she said when her friend answered the phone, she was ready to go to the E.R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The woman wasn’t sure when she started to feel bad; a month ago, maybe two. “At my age,” she told me recently, “you can’t expect to feel good every day.” But a couple of weeks before the call from her doctor, something happened to make her wonder if her symptoms were about more than just getting older. It was early on a morning in June, and she had come to the veterinarian’s office to pick up a medication for her elderly dog. On the way back to her car, she ran into a friend, and as they stood chatting casually about dogs and children, the woman suddenly turned pale. She swayed dangerously. Her friend grabbed her and, throwing an arm around her shoulder, helped her back into the building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;A veterinary assistant rushed out to help. The woman sat slumped in a chair, her face drained of color, her eyes strangely unfocused. Her blood pressure was abnormally low. As she slowly came back to herself, her first response was embarrassment. She didn’t like being the center of attention, and there she was, surrounded by worried faces. “I’m all right, really I am,” she said over and over. But she knew, and they knew, it wasn’t true. She sipped the water she was given, and color seeped back into her face. When she felt well enough to stand, her friend offered to drive her home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 09:01:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxPRi1IQ1JKc09icHlyWmcxT1NmRTNtck9ELU5HdHFmd240ZU9HMV9ROWwwb0ZvYnRGenU3eFpPTlZibTI4cGw3Nkh6YTlpNW1RT1FjMmtDQl9CUGo3b1U5bnFEa3dDcVJ4cTNpbnpPSHJDWjM5RU1vMExZR0dpRUV3WG9FUE9HWG9mMWxXS1dkU1k</guid></item><item><title>New blood test may help diagnose, show how far Alzheimer’s has progressed - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE5sRXhrdG1pTXhXa0dGSDFaaG10cGlUdm5mdG5kcU9pMHhaaGF4THNkLXVWU2RNT2YwQWZGVmxHSThLTXN6MHJoYk1lMEtNU295d2RXdHZaTWY5RjdXTGM4VUlES3V6LUNWTml6eVhmeEs?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse collapsed"&gt;A new blood test could help doctors diagnose and identify the stage of Alzheimer’s.

By tracking different processes of Alzheimer’s disease, we can better diagnose, predict and even develop new and better treatments for Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The new biomarker — plasma eMTBR-tau243 — reflects changes in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10932364/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tau pathology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;tau pathology&lt;/a&gt; occurring in the clinical symptomatic phase of Alzheimer’s disease and can be used to stage Alzheimer’s disease tauopathy, and to determine if cognitive symptoms are likely due to Alzheimer’s disease tau pathology,” added &lt;a href="https://batemanlab.wustl.edu/people/kanta-horie-phd/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kanta Horie, PhD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Kanta Horie, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, voluntary research associate professor of neurology at WashU Medicine in St. Louis, MO, and both co-first and co-corresponding author of this study. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Also, many therapeutic developments are ongoing including anti-amyloid and anti-tau drugs.  We believe that this new biomarker becomes the key to establish the plasma biomarkers panel to stage Alzheimer’s disease, which would open the new window of &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319875" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:precision medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;precision medicine&lt;/a&gt; era for Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Biomarker up to 200 times higher in late-stage Alzheimer’s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the study, researchers tested study participants from three main stages of Alzheimer’s disease: presymptomatic, early-stage with &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/memory-loss-and-forgetfulness/what-mild-cognitive-impairment" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mild cognitive impairments;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;mild cognitive impairments&lt;/a&gt;, and late symptomatic disease where participants have been diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that blood MTBR-tau243 levels reflected the amount of tau tangles in the brain with 92% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among participants showing cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease, researchers discovered that MTBR-tau243 levels were significantly higher for participants at the mild cognitive stage, and up to 200 times higher for those in the late symptomatic disease stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease is highly associated with (tau) &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9509477/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neurofibrillary tangles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;neurofibrillary tangles&lt;/a&gt; (NFTs) pathology in (the) brain, not amyloid plaques pathology. Since we know that NFTs are more generated in the dementia stage in Alzheimer’s disease, it is reasonable for us to see the drastic increase of MTBR-tau243 in the dementia stage compared to the preclinical Alzheimer’s disease stage, which suggests the validation to characterize the plasma MTBR-tau243 biomarker as the tau NFTs-specific biomarker.” &lt;br&gt;— Kanta Horie, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The significance of finding increasing amounts of MTBR-243 related to Alzheimer’s symptoms — memory loss and thinking impairment — is (that) this discovery now allows us to track the clinical symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease with a blood test,” Bateman explained. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Blood tests: Next step in Alzheimer’s diagnosis and treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This new blood test can confirm the amount of tau tangles in the brain that helps determine the stage of Alzheimer’s disease and if cognitive decline is likely due to Alzheimer’s disease.

There’s a growing understanding that early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s, which is a complex process, is crucial for effective intervention. Current treatments, while limited, may be more beneficial in the early stages of the disease. A readily available blood test could enable much earlier detection than current methods, allowing for earlier intervention and potentially slowing disease progression.”&lt;br&gt;— Manisha Parulekar, MD, FACP, AGSF, CMD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The initial study needs to be replicated in larger and more diverse populations to confirm its accuracy and reliability across different demographics, ethnicities, and stages of the disease,” Parulekar added. “This includes testing individuals with other neurological conditions to ensure specificity.  Clear and standardized protocols for blood collection, processing, and analysis must be established to ensure consistent and reproducible results across different laboratories and healthcare settings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;View the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/new-blood-test-may-help-diagnose-show-how-far-alzheimers-progressed/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Medical News Today;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 08:06:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5sRXhrdG1pTXhXa0dGSDFaaG10cGlUdm5mdG5kcU9pMHhaaGF4THNkLXVWU2RNT2YwQWZGVmxHSThLTXN6MHJoYk1lMEtNU295d2RXdHZaTWY5RjdXTGM4VUlES3V6LUNWTml6eVhmeEs</guid></item><item><title>Northwest Harris County child with no travel history tests positive for measles - Houston Chronicle</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxQQXFIRk9jMndJU3doRHA3ankzbDdLajRMckk2QWllWFhSUkpneXhMVENtSWdlLTNmTUlObExtMFlSbkZEZnJWRVZkWlZaMkhTMEl5WGxxYlVoWlp4TzMyQWJSNTVwTnVkQV83NFFpZEQyYWhzckhBc2FPZndmNjFydzFVeXExb1J1Q1NwcXJPQUhEUmNrbm1CR1p6S2lGWjRRQ1d1ZGw3UWx5ZDB5U0NHdFRBVW5VMXYyaFNQc3VXTjI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="rel"&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:-mx40 lg:-mx56 x100vw sm:cw-80 lg:cw-112 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A measles sign is seen at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center Tuesday, Feb. 25, 2025, in Lubbock, Texas.

Investigators are still working to determine how the child was exposed to the virus, and whether the case is associated with the ongoing Texas outbreak that started in the South Plains region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Harris County child has since recovered from the illness and did not need to be hospitalized, Brown said during a media briefing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="A300" data-large-id="CONCERT1" data-unit="hnp-houstonchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The child received one dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine prior to the infection, Brown said. She declined to say whether the child is too young to have received a second dose, which the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends for children 4 to 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harris County Public Health launched a contact-tracing investigation to identify anyone who may have been exposed to the child, Brown said.

			&lt;p&gt;When it comes to weight loss dieting, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-compared-3-popular-weight-loss-methods-to-find-what-works-best"&gt;number of options&lt;/a&gt; can be overwhelming. A new study suggests a simple approach could make a bigger impact than constantly counting calories: the 4:3 intermittent fasting routine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 4:3 intermittent fasting schedule involves limiting calorie intake for three days each week and eating normally for the remaining four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers in the US found that this approach led to a 7.6 percent average weight loss over a year, compared to just 5 percent with a traditional daily caloric restriction diet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not a huge difference, but it suggests that for some people at least, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/intermittent-fasting-seems-to-result-in-dynamic-changes-to-the-human-brain"&gt;varying diet restrictions&lt;/a&gt; might be more effective – and easier to stick to – than maintaining a daily calorie limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_157316" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-157316" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/WeightChart.jpg" alt="Weight chart" class="wp-image-157316 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/WeightChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/WeightChart-563x415.jpg 563w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/WeightChart-600x442.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-157316" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers tracked weight across 12 months. (Catenacci et al., &lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was surprising and exciting to me that it was better," &lt;a href="https://news.cuanschutz.edu/news-stories/intermittent-fasting-outperforms-calorie-counting-in-weight-loss-study"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; endocrinologist Victoria Catenacci, from the University of Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team put 165 participants with overweight or obesity, aged between 18 and 60, through a 4:3 intermittent fasting (IMF) or daily caloric restriction (DRC) diet over the course of 12 months, while also recommending increases in activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IMF group was told to apply an 80 percent &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-many-calories-do-you-need-to-cut-each-day-to-lose-weight"&gt;calorie intake restriction&lt;/a&gt; on three days out of seven, with no restrictions on the other four days (though eating healthily was still encouraged). To match the limits overall, the DRC group was told to reduce their daily calorie intake by 34 percent each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weight loss varied in both groups, but the IMF group averaged a 7.7 kg (17 pounds) drop, compared to 4.8 kg (11 pounds) for the DRC group. Small improvements in health markers like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-5-minutes-of-exercise-a-day-can-lower-blood-pressure-study-shows"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; were also seen across both groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The more important message to me is that this is a dietary strategy that is an evidence-based alternative, especially for people who have tried DCR and found it difficult," &lt;a href="https://news.cuanschutz.edu/news-stories/intermittent-fasting-outperforms-calorie-counting-in-weight-loss-study"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Catenacci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study comes with some caveats. Participants self-reported their food and energy intake, and while the IMF group only recorded their fasting days, it's possible they were also limiting calorie intake on non-fasting days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers think the IMF group may have been better at sticking to their diets too, which may have influenced the results – but that could be seen as a positive, as weight loss programs are more effective if they're &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/intermittent-fasting-does-work-for-weight-loss-but-only-if-you-follow-this-rule"&gt;easier to follow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Despite these nuances,&lt;/span&gt; it's a win for intermittent fasting here. Plenty of research has been published on IMF in recent years, with both &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-intermittent-fasting-has-2-key-benefits-for-people-with-obesity"&gt;potential benefits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/intermittent-fasting-could-trigger-cancer-risks-study-in-mice-shows"&gt;possible drawbacks&lt;/a&gt; highlighted, but what we know for sure is that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-predict-80-of-american-adults-will-be-overweight-or-obese-by-2050"&gt;obesity is rising&lt;/a&gt; – and we need more effective, personalized approaches to tackle it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Right now, a specific comprehensive program focusing on 4:3 IMF doesn't exist to our knowledge," &lt;a href="https://news.cuanschutz.edu/news-stories/intermittent-fasting-outperforms-calorie-counting-in-weight-loss-study"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; physical activity epidemiologist Danielle Ostendorf, from the University of Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"So, I want to work on how to design this for implementation in clinics and community programs that are accessible to people and make this something that they can afford."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in the &lt;a href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-01631"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In one study, eating two kiwis daily was comparable to taking psyllium—a popular fiber supplement—for its effects on improving constipation, notes &lt;a href="https://amandasauceda.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Amanda Sauceda, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, creator of the Mindful Gut.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This isn’t particularly surprising, as kiwi is an excellent source of fiber, providing 5 grams in a single cup.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Fiber helps your bowels stay regular, and that, in turn, can help with other digestive issues like constipation and bloating,” says Sauceda.

Digestive enzymes help break down what you eat and keep your digestive process moving at a regular pace. &lt;a href="https://www.rikernutritionconsulting.com/about-cari" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cari Riker, RDN, LDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Riker Nutrition Consulting, says that kiwis contain a specific type of enzyme called actinidin, which helps break down protein. While more research is needed on the benefits of actinidin for constipation, this enzyme may have a slight laxative effect by speeding up the movement of food through the GI tract.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Staying hydrated is essential for managing constipation, especially when increasing total fiber intake. “When consuming a lot of fiber, it is important to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8030662/normal-reasons-youre-constipated/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;increase water&lt;/a&gt; content to help the stools pass easier,” says Riker. Drinking water is an obvious and important way to hydrate, but an often-overlooked source of water comes from the foods you eat. Fruits and vegetables are top contributors to hydration in the diet, and kiwi is no exception. One cup of kiwi contains approximately 5 ounces of water.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Physical activity isn’t just good for your heart, bones and muscles—it’s also important for your digestive tract. “If you are experiencing constipation, it is important to not stay sedentary—get up and move to improve your gut motility,” says Riker. While research isn’t conclusive as to why physical activity prevents constipation, studies have shown that when &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/evening-activity-to-help-you-poop-in-the-morning-11701702" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;physical activity increases&lt;/a&gt;, constipation often decreases.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While regular exercise is important, it doesn’t have to involve lengthy gym sessions or an hour on the treadmill. “Movement doesn’t have to be intense, because even a walk after eating can be very beneficial,” says Sauceda. Research suggests that just 30 to 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity can help prevent constipation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re chronically constipated, adding more &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8012002/can-magnesium-help-you-poop/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium&lt;/a&gt; to your diet may be helpful. “Magnesium is particularly effective for relieving constipation,” says &lt;a href="https://www.nourishedpediatrics.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Danielle Zold, RD, LDN, CLC, CGN&lt;/a&gt;, owner of Nourished Pediatrics. &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-magnesium-supplements-8425114" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Magnesium supplements&lt;/a&gt; can also be used in the treatment of chronic constipation. However, as certain types of magnesium may be more helpful than others, it’s best to work with a registered dietitian or other health care provider for personalized advice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Be Wary of Supplements &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Supplements to treat constipation may not be beneficial, especially long-term. Besides potential concerns around quality and too-good-to-be-true claims, Sauceda warns that relying on supplements to poop may be a sign of something more serious and is a reason to talk with a health care provider about your bowel habits. It’s especially important to note that laxatives can have mild to serious side effects and should not be used long-term unless under the supervision of a health care provider.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ultimately, while supplements and laxatives might seem like a convenient fix, it’s best to work with a health care professional to identify the root cause of your constipation. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most Americans don’t eat enough fiber, which can have a cascade of negative health effects, including increasing the risk for constipation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “To help stay regular, I encourage consuming a diet rich in fiber, at least 25 grams per day for women and 30 grams per day for men,” says Riker. Because fiber comes from plant-based foods, incorporate more produce, beans, whole grains, nuts and seeds to meet your daily fiber goals and keep constipation at bay.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Constipation can be uncomfortable and frustrating. Fortunately, making simple lifestyle changes, like adding a kiwi or two to your diet, may offer relief. Kiwis are high in fiber, contain digestive enzymes and provide water, all of which can help make your stools easier to pass. Of course, simply eating more kiwi is unlikely to solve your bathroom problems. Other factors, like your overall fiber intake and how physically active you are, also play a role in managing or preventing constipation.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nothing in life comes free, not even a sugar-free drink. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scientists have now linked the artificial sweetener sucralose (sold as Splenda) to yet another potential health downside – and this time, the impact is not in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;gut&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;span&gt; it's in the brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a randomized crossover trial, when a group of 75 adults drank a beverage containing sucralose, they showed heightened blood flow to the hypothalamus &lt;span&gt;– &lt;/span&gt; a part of the brain that helps control appetite and cravings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By contrast, when the same participants drank a beverage with sucrose (aka table sugar), there was a hunger-dampening effect. Peripheral glucose levels spiked, and this corresponded with reduced blood flow to the hypothalamus.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two hours after drinking sucrose, participants reported significantly lower hunger levels than after they drank sucralose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156915" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156915" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/Structures-of-sucrose-and-sucralose-642x202.png" alt="Sucrose vs Sucralose" class="size-medium wp-image-156915" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/Structures-of-sucrose-and-sucralose-642x202.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/Structures-of-sucrose-and-sucralose-768x242.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/Structures-of-sucrose-and-sucralose-600x189.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/Structures-of-sucrose-and-sucralose.png 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156915" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The structures of sucrose and sucralose. (Anushkkaran, &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338073242_Artificial_Sweeteners"&gt;&lt;em&gt;International Journal of Research and Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, which are supported by &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/a0031717"&gt;&lt;span&gt;initial research on rodents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, suggest that non-caloric sweeteners may not actually be useful for losing weight or for reducing sugar cravings in the long run. In fact, they seem to change how the hypothalamus communicates with other parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sucralose is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/food-additives-petitions/aspartame-and-other-sweeteners-food"&gt;&lt;span&gt;600 times sweeter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; than sucrose but with zero calories. This may create "a mismatch between the expectation of caloric intake and the absence of actual energy", the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01227-8"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If your body is expecting a calorie because of the sweetness, but doesn't get the calorie it's expecting, that could change the way the brain is primed to crave those substances over time," &lt;a href="https://keck.usc.edu/news/calorie-free-sweeteners-can-disrupt-the-brains-appetite-signals/"&gt;warns&lt;/a&gt; a supervisor of the study, endocrinologist Kathleen Alanna Page from the University of Southern California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Page and her team say it is vital that the long-term health impacts of Splenda and similar sweeteners are investigated with further research, especially since &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2016.11.004"&gt;as many as 40 percent&lt;/a&gt; of American adults regularly consume these sugar substitutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The recent trial included 75 participants between the ages of 18 and 35 who underwent three interventions each, receiving blood tests and brain scans before and after.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One day, they drank a beverage with sucralose. Another day, they drank a beverage with sucrose. And on a third day, they drank a glass of water. All the drinks had an unsweetened cherry flavor so the participants didn't know the difference. Each person served as their own control.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order of the drinks was randomized for each participant, and the gap between sessions was anywhere from two days to two months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike drinking real sugar, drinking sucralose did not cause a spike in peripheral glucose levels, or hormones like insulin and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which help control blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The body uses these hormones to tell the brain you've consumed calories, in order to decrease hunger," &lt;a href="https://keck.usc.edu/news/calorie-free-sweeteners-can-disrupt-the-brains-appetite-signals/"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Page. "Sucralose did not have that effect – and the differences in hormone responses to sucralose compared to sugar were even more pronounced in participants with obesity."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that metabolic signals in the body are closely tied to brain activity. &lt;span&gt;When sucralose &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/some-artificial-sweeteners-may-have-a-not-so-sweet-impact-on-our-bodies"&gt;interacts with gut microbes&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, previous studies have found it can impair the body's response to glucose. Perhaps this is also feeding into the unique hypothalamic response identified in the current research.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once, Splenda was considered &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/10937404.2013.842523"&gt;&lt;span&gt;biologically inert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, but recent studies have found concerning signs that this popular sugar substitute, often found in diet drinks and chewing gum, is linked to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-common-artificial-sweetener-can-break-down-dna-scientists-warn"&gt;&lt;span&gt;DNA damage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/artificial-sweeteners-bring-on-glucose-intolerance-and-alter-gut-microbiota"&gt;&lt;span&gt;impairments in glucose tolerance, and an altered gut microbiome&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Two years after the World Health Organization &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/life14030323"&gt;&lt;span&gt;issued&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a health warning about sucralose and its possible metabolic and inflammatory impacts, we have yet another reason to worry about consuming the sweetener willy-nilly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Page and her colleagues are now conducting a follow-up study to see how sucralose impacts the brains of children and adolescents specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Are these substances leading to changes in the developing brains of children who are at risk for obesity?" &lt;a href="https://keck.usc.edu/news/calorie-free-sweeteners-can-disrupt-the-brains-appetite-signals/"&gt;asks&lt;/a&gt; Page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The brain is vulnerable during this time, so it could be a critical opportunity to intervene."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The study was published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-025-01227-8"&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            As the United States faces one of its worst measles outbreaks in decades, a new analysis finds that nearly a third of young children who were eligible to be vaccinated against the disease did not get their first shot on schedule.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu00043b6mi2dg99kq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles is an extremely&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;contagious airborne disease that can be especially dangerous for young and unvaccinated children. The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is highly effective, with one shot offering 93% protection against measles and a second shot raising it to 97%. The first dose is recommended between 12 and 15 months of age and the second dose between ages 4 and 6.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu00053b6mkdq6rdk0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2024, just 68.5% of children in the US had received their first dose by 15 months of age, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.truveta.com/blog/research/research-insights/first-time-measles-vaccination-trends-us-children-under-24-months/" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from Truveta, a health-care data and analytics company. This is a marked decline from 2020, when more than 77% of children had received their first shot by this age.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu00063b6mur13d2oq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The pool of children that could get really sick, could have severe complications and possibly die, has been bigger each year since Covid,” said Dr. Nina Masters, a senior research scientist at Truveta and former epidemiologist at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Especially among these outbreaks, it’s just a very troubling thing to see in the data.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu00073b6mvkubs9yi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Department of Health and Human Services has set a &lt;a href="https://health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/browse-objectives/vaccination/maintain-vaccination-coverage-level-2-doses-mmr-vaccine-children-kindergarten-iid-04" target="_blank"&gt;goal&lt;/a&gt; that at least 95% of children in kindergarten will have gotten two doses of the MMR vaccine, a threshold necessary to help prevent outbreaks of measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu00083b6mi0gzhhoc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But leaving more than 30% of a particularly vulnerable population of young children without any protection from one dose creates unnecessary risk, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Don’t delay, and particularly not now,” Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health who was federal Covid-19 response coordinator in the Biden administration, advises parents.

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu000a3b6mkhojgxm7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At least 565 cases of measles have been reported in the US this year, according to a CNN tally using data from the CDC and state health departments. It’s only the third year with more than 500 cases since measles was declared eliminated in the country a quarter-century ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu000b3b6mvijygu06@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Texas, the epicenter of the current outbreak, at least a third of all reported cases have been among children younger than 5, according to &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; from the state health department. Nearly all were unvaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu000c3b6mvurrkf2o@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Once you get below 95% [vaccination], the ability of that virus to start circulating in the community goes up substantially,” Jha said. “Even small decreases in the percentage of school-age kids being vaccinated could mean much bigger outbreaks in terms of the number of children who are involved.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu000d3b6mm35by5of@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Undervaccinated pockets of the US create broader vulnerabilities, he said. When eligible children are not vaccinated, it creates a greater risk that the virus will reach those who are too young to be vaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu000e3b6mc9p79xyl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s essentially like dry timber waiting to be lit on fire,” Jha said. “What you have is just a lot of vulnerable communities around America. And I think we’re sort of playing Russian roulette here with these outbreaks, because obviously, people don’t stay local.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu000g3b6mprg86j2i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new Truveta report also highlights the divide between vaccination rates for children in urban areas, where 75% of children had gotten a dose of MMR by 15 months of age, and rural areas, where only 65.5% of kids had gotten the shot.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu000h3b6m4mbqksbf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The reasons for this disparity can be “divided into structural barriers and then vaccine hesitancy,” said Dr. Catherine Troisi, infectious disease epidemiologist with UTHealth Houston.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu000i3b6m3basb68r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In rural areas, there might be fewer medical providers in general, and people may have to travel father to get vaccinated, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu000j3b6mhcbv74w8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Troisi said studies show that in rural areas, there are also more people who “may buy into some of the misinformation about immunizations.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu000k3b6mqyea3826@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Texas outbreak started in rural Gaines County, which now has 280 cases, according to the state health department, although experts say that is most likely a severe undercount.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu000l3b6mzvjfej4i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Coverage with the MMR vaccine is particularly low in Gaines County, where nearly 1 in 5 incoming kindergartners in the 2023-24 school year had not gotten the shot. Some other counties affected by the outbreak – which now includes New Mexico, Oklahoma and possibly Kansas – also fall below the 95% vaccination benchmark.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu000n3b6mfo7dcl50@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Another new &lt;a href="https://www.truveta.com/blog/research/research-insights/latest-trends-in-two-dose-vaccination-against-measles-among-children-in-the-us/" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from Truveta found that in 2024 just 80.4% of children had received two doses of the MMR vaccine by the time they turned 6, far lower than CDC estimates, which put coverage at just under 93% for kindergartners in the 2023-24 school year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu000o3b6mx6v6sj5i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The data analyses capture two different populations, and “likely the truth lies somewhere in the middle,” said Masters, who has studied measles for the past decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu000p3b6mb4fz2y36@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Truveta’s database captures electronic health records for nearly a third of the US population and covers nearly a fifth of daily clinical care across the country, but the findings from its analysis of people seeking more regular primary care may not be fully representative of nationwide trends.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu000q3b6mrhd9vjql@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But vaccination data from the CDC is an estimate too, based on surveys with varying representation, none of which would capture the growing share of children who are homeschooled.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu000r3b6m0y40xwie@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other recent research also suggests that MMR vaccine coverage may be lower than federal data says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu000s3b6mq6emaeot@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A survey of nearly 20,000 parents between mid-2023 and mid-2024 found that just 71.8% said their children had gotten at least one dose of MMR vaccine by age 5, according to a &lt;a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/epdf/10.2105/AJPH.2024.307912" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published last month in the American Journal of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu000t3b6mlqo0z9f0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although each analysis might differ in its approach, the consistent finding of declining vaccination rates is the most consequential takeaway, Masters said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu000u3b6mkbpqf22x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Every analysis, every outbreak, always has the same conclusion that you end outbreaks with rapid, prompt mass vaccination. That’s how you bring outbreaks under control,” she said. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We’re not getting close to bringing this under control, and we’re exposing a situation where there are more kids who are at risk instead of fewer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

            As the United States faces one of its worst measles outbreaks in decades, a new analysis finds that nearly a third of young children who were eligible to be vaccinated against the disease did not get their first shot on schedule.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu00043b6mi2dg99kq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Measles is an extremely&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;contagious airborne disease that can be especially dangerous for young and unvaccinated children. The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is highly effective, with one shot offering 93% protection against measles and a second shot raising it to 97%. The first dose is recommended between 12 and 15 months of age and the second dose between ages 4 and 6.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu00053b6mkdq6rdk0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2024, just 68.5% of children in the US had received their first dose by 15 months of age, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.truveta.com/blog/research/research-insights/first-time-measles-vaccination-trends-us-children-under-24-months/" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from Truveta, a health-care data and analytics company. This is a marked decline from 2020, when more than 77% of children had received their first shot by this age.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu00063b6mur13d2oq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The pool of children that could get really sick, could have severe complications and possibly die, has been bigger each year since Covid,” said Dr. Nina Masters, a senior research scientist at Truveta and former epidemiologist at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “Especially among these outbreaks, it’s just a very troubling thing to see in the data.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu00073b6mvkubs9yi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The US Department of Health and Human Services has set a &lt;a href="https://health.gov/healthypeople/objectives-and-data/browse-objectives/vaccination/maintain-vaccination-coverage-level-2-doses-mmr-vaccine-children-kindergarten-iid-04" target="_blank"&gt;goal&lt;/a&gt; that at least 95% of children in kindergarten will have gotten two doses of the MMR vaccine, a threshold necessary to help prevent outbreaks of measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu00083b6mi0gzhhoc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But leaving more than 30% of a particularly vulnerable population of young children without any protection from one dose creates unnecessary risk, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm91waxlu00093b6mp2azsi2f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Every analysis, every outbreak, always has the same conclusion that you end outbreaks with rapid, prompt mass vaccination. That’s how you bring outbreaks under control,” she said. “We’re going in the wrong direction. We’re not getting close to bringing this under control, and we’re exposing a situation where there are more kids who are at risk instead of fewer.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

It's a child under the age of 18 with no travel history.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div class="article__body"&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HARRIS COUNTY, Texas — Harris County Public Health said it's investigating a &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles/texas-measles-outbreak-cases-counties/285-5834b9ed-f893-4fe6-af3c-cf671ed6b0c7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;measles&lt;/a&gt; case in a child younger than 18.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said the child lives in northwest Harris County and doesn't have a history of traveling. The child has had the first of two measles vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that children get two MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine doses:&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;First dose: 12 through 15 months of age&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Second dose: 4 through 6 years of age&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials are trying to identify anyone the patient has had close contact with recently.  Experts say nine out of 10 people exposed will get infected if they're not immunized. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by a virus, which spreads through coughing and sneezing. This is a great reminder about the importance of keeping children up to date with vaccines," Harris County Local Health Authority Dr. Ericka Brown said. "Measles is easily preventable through vaccination."&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said it's too soon to know if this case is linked to the &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles/texas-measles-outbreak-cases-counties/285-5834b9ed-f893-4fe6-af3c-cf671ed6b0c7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;outbreak in West Texas&lt;/a&gt;. The child has already recovered.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's the first reported measles case in Harris County since 2019 when four people were treated for it.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown said there was no cause for alarm.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The reason I am not concerned at this time is because Harris County has a 94% immunization rate," she explained saying that's just below the 95% vaccination rate the CDC recommends for herd immunity.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday, the state reported 422 measles cases, mostly in West Texas and the South Plains. Another update on the number of cases will be released on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 25% of people who get measles will end up in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                                &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_embed"&gt;

Using advanced genetic tools, researchers showed that disabling microRNAs during specific developmental windows impaired the cells’ growth and ability to form key connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study identified two critical microRNAs and their gene targets that govern the branching and connectivity of Purkinje cells. These findings open the door to understanding how disruptions in microRNA networks could contribute to conditions like autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developmental Timing:&lt;/strong&gt; MicroRNAs are essential at two distinct stages of Purkinje cell growth.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Regulators Identified:&lt;/strong&gt; miR-206 and miR-133 target genes that control cell expansion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neurodevelopmental Insight:&lt;/strong&gt; Disrupting these pathways may be linked to autism-related genes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Scripps Research Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our brains contain billions of neurons and trillions of connections, and scientists are only beginning to understand the intricate process required to build this level of complexity. This includes uncovering the role of microRNAs: small, single-stranded molecules that help regulate protein production throughout the brain and the rest of the body.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Scripps Research scientists have revealed how microRNAs impacts Purkinje cell development—a rare type of neuron with links to neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108381"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/purkinjie-cells-genetics-autism-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/purkinjie-cells-genetics-autism-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/purkinjie-cells-genetics-autism-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/purkinjie-cells-genetics-autism-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/purkinjie-cells-genetics-autism-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/purkinjie-cells-genetics-autism-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/purkinjie-cells-genetics-autism-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/purkinjie-cells-genetics-autism-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/purkinjie-cells-genetics-autism-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/purkinjie-cells-genetics-autism-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/purkinjie-cells-genetics-autism-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/purkinjie-cells-genetics-autism-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/purkinjie-cells-genetics-autism-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/purkinjie-cells-genetics-autism-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/purkinjie-cells-genetics-autism-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Some of these gene targets have been previously linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings, published online in &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt; on April 2, 2025, could help uncover the complicated origins of these conditions, while also shedding light on how microRNAs are involved in aging, plasticity and other key brain processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dissecting microRNA networks in the developing brain has important implications for understanding neurodevelopmental disorders, especially in Purkinje cells, which are the most affected neuronal subtype in autism spectrum disorder,” says senior author Giordano Lippi, associate professor of neuroscience at Scripps Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have suggested that microRNAs are critical for brain development, but their specific role in differentiation—the process of stem cells maturing into specialized cells—remained unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When neurons develop, they need to at some point decide what subtype they will become, but we really didn’t know much about the blueprint that instructs this differentiation,” says Lippi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was a lot of evidence suggesting that microRNAs might have a very important role here, but because the tools were not good enough, we couldn’t really nail down that question until now.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team focused on Purkinje cells, which comprise less than 1% of cells in the cerebellum. Purkinje cells integrate information from different parts of the brain and body, enabling us to make smooth, controlled movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are some of the largest brain cells and have a tree-like appearance—a single axon “trunk” that supports a system of “branches” known as the dendritic arbor. Purkinje cells are also surrounded by structures called climbing fibers that wrap around the cells’ dendrites and deliver information from other parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To attain their large size and elaborate arbor, Purkinje cell development involves prolonged periods of growth and branching. In mice, the long process of Purkinje cell development is complete around four weeks after birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate how microRNAs are involved in neuron differentiation, the team developed new tools that temporarily turn off microRNA function during specific developmental windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that microRNAs are critical during two phases in Purkinje cell development: inhibiting microRNAs during the first week after birth resulted in Purkinje cells with less complex dendritic arbors and smaller cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, inhibiting microRNAs during the third week after birth prevented the Purkinje cells from forming synaptic connections with climbing fibers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings shed light on how microRNAs control the precise timing of different aspects of Purkinje cell development that were previously thought to happen concurrently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with co-senior author Ian MacRae, professor of integrative structural and computational biology at Scripps Research, the team also developed a mouse model to identify which genes the microRNA molecules were targeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this system, they identified two microRNAs critical for Purkinje cell development (miR-206 and miR-133) and four gene targets (&lt;em&gt;Shank3&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Prag1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Vash1&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;En2)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they compared the Purkinje cell microRNA-target map to a map for pyramidal neurons—a functionally different but similar-looking brain cell—they showed that the two cell types follow very different microRNA blueprints during development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For the first time, we were able to see that certain microRNAs are enriched in Purkinje cells but not in pyramidal neurons,” says Lippi, “and by turning these microRNAs off we show how important they are for the development of Purkinje cells’ unique morphological features.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, three of the targets involved in Purkinje cell development act as “brakes” for cell growth. When microRNA binds to these targets, it takes off the brakes, which allows Purkinje cells to grow their exaggerated dendritic arbor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these gene targets have been previously linked to neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our results seem to suggest that there might be cases in which dysregulation of the microRNA-target networks in specific areas of the brain might be causative to some of these diseases,” says first author Norjin Zolboot, a postdoctoral fellow in the Lippi lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have not actually explored any of those mechanisms, but this is something that we are looking forward to investigating in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the team is also planning to use their new toolset to further investigate microRNAs’ role in development, neural plasticity and aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With these new tools, a lot of doors are opening,” says Lippi. “We have barely scratched the surface of what microRNAs are doing, but now we have a way to thoroughly investigate all of this, and I think this is a very powerful toolset that will be broadly used by the field.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Lippi, MacRae, and Zolboot, authors of the study, “MicroRNA mechanisms instructing Purkinje cell specification,”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;include Yao Xiao, Jessica Du, Marwan Ghanem, Su Yeun Choi, Miranda Junn, Federico Zampa, Zeyi Huang of Scripps Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This study was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health (R01NS121223, RF1MH126719, R35GM127090, R21OD029999, F31NS118982), Autism Speaks (12923), the Whitehall Foundation (2018-12-55), and Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (2024-338468).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this genetics and neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#10606275636350637362796060633e757465" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Press Office&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://scripps.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Scripps Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Press Office – Scripps Research Institute&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(25)00181-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;MicroRNA mechanisms instructing Purkinje cell specification&lt;/a&gt;” by Giordano Lippi et al. &lt;em&gt;Neuron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MicroRNA mechanisms instructing Purkinje cell specification&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are critical for brain development; however, if, when, and how miRNAs drive neuronal subtype specification remains poorly understood. To address this, we engineered technologies with vastly improved spatiotemporal resolution that allow the dissection of cell-type-specific miRNA-target networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast and reversible miRNA loss of function showed that miRNAs are necessary for Purkinje cell (PC) differentiation, which previously appeared to be miRNA independent, and identified distinct critical miRNA windows for dendritogenesis and climbing fiber synaptogenesis, structural features defining PC identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using new mouse models that enable miRNA-target network mapping in rare cell types, we uncovered PC-specific post-transcriptional programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manipulation of these programs revealed that the PC-enriched miR-206 and targets &lt;em&gt;Shank3&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Prag1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;En2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Vash1&lt;/em&gt;, which are uniquely repressed in PCs, are critical regulators of PC-specific dendritogenesis and synaptogenesis, with miR-206 knockdown and target overexpression partially phenocopying miRNA loss of function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that gene expression regulation by miRNAs, beyond transcription, is critical for neuronal subtype specification.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 22:35:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTFBQNkljaTEzVFN0RG9hekR0ZVNDMWhZY3JscDBuSHJ6OGpJbFdRblF6RUZVajRucmFvOHlRaDJJdHJYTXFXT2hVSDdmNTcyOWpGdUUxcTlTMjFXUk1XMURUd2tGRWZFUE9HWEpzYnVHV0NXdw</guid></item><item><title>A Common Sleeping Pill Could Reduce Buildup of Alzheimer's Proteins, Study Finds - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxNM3BKZmdreUVXTEVpYU1YMHFKZWo5ekJXUWpQaHlDNkoyVGZFenJmYnB2MTVOc0hDbmNKNzEyLTVCdkpQSGpNWFo1NXB1WS1ReUhrRnBUZVBuSzNsR0Z4aE4yNlBUVzdLRFI2bnh2dWpDNWZodk1JYVo3TENNWnBYQWNxa01UNHA2SnRZX3U2STAtc0Mta0hyRHpzajhCakJmUEtXR1A5Y1lORTg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;There's still so much we don't know about  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="157318" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease, but the link between poor sleep and worsening disease is one that researchers are exploring with gusto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in 2023, scientists found that using sleeping pills to get some shut-eye could reduce the build-up of toxic clumps of proteins in fluid that washes the brain clean every night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Washington University in St. Louis found people who took &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suvorexant"&gt;suvorexant&lt;/a&gt;, a common treatment for insomnia, for two nights at a sleep clinic experienced a slight drop in two proteins, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amyloid_beta"&gt;amyloid-beta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_protein"&gt;tau&lt;/a&gt;, that pile up in Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7o-2MOlH8EY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though only short and involving a small group of healthy adults, the study is an interesting demonstration of the link between sleep and the molecular markers of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep disturbances can be an early warning sign of Alzheimer's disease that precedes other symptoms, such as memory loss and cognitive decline. And by the time the first symptoms develop, levels of abnormal amyloid-beta are almost peaking, forming clumps called plaques that clog up brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_142437" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-142437" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-642x500.jpg" alt="Clumps of yellow forming among purple neurons" class="size-medium wp-image-142437" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-642x500.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-768x598.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-600x467.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642.jpg 1204w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-142437" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Illustration of amyloid plaques.

&lt;p&gt;While sleeping pills may help in that regard, "it would be premature for people who are worried about developing Alzheimer's to interpret it as a reason to start taking suvorexant every night," &lt;a href="https://medicine.wustl.edu/news/sleeping-pill-reduces-levels-of-alzheimers-proteins/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Brendan Lucey, of Washington University's Sleep Medicine Center, who led the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study spanned just two nights and involved 38 middle-aged participants who showed no signs of cognitive impairment and had no sleep issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using sleeping pills for prolonged periods is &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/half-and-half-mix-of-placebos-and-sleeping-pills-may-be-best-for-insomnia-study-finds"&gt;not an ideal solution&lt;/a&gt; for those short on sleep either, as it's quite easy to become dependent on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleeping pills may also lull people into shallower bouts of sleep rather than deep sleep phases. This could be problematic as &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aau6550"&gt;earlier research from Lucey and colleagues&lt;/a&gt; found a link between less good quality, slow-wave sleep and elevated levels of tau tangles and amyloid-beta protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their latest study, Lucey and colleagues wanted to see if improving sleep with the aid of sleeping pills could lower levels of tau and amyloid-beta in the cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord. Past research shows that even just &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1721694115"&gt;one night of disrupted sleep&lt;/a&gt; can send amyloid-beta levels rising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_141228" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-141228" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/AlarmClockWithPersonSleepingInBackgroundBlurry_R_U_642.jpg" alt="An alarm clock in the foreground with a blurred person in bed" class="size-full wp-image-141228" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/AlarmClockWithPersonSleepingInBackgroundBlurry_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/AlarmClockWithPersonSleepingInBackgroundBlurry_R_U_642-600x337.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-141228" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Promoting sleep could be one avenue to stave off Alzheimer's disease. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADEbULOUn4/"&gt;Motortion/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A group of volunteers aged 45 to 65 years old received one of two doses of suvorexant or a  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-is-a-placebo" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="102371" data-postid="157318" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;placebo&lt;/a&gt; pill, an hour after researchers tapped their cerebrospinal fluid to collect a small sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers continued to collect samples every two hours for 36 hours while the participants slept and during the next day and night, to measure how protein levels changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no differences in sleep between the groups, and yet amyloid-beta concentrations were reduced by between 10 and 20 percent with a dose of suvorexant usually prescribed for insomnia, compared to a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The higher dose of suvorexant also momentarily reduced levels of hyperphosphorylated tau, a modified form of the tau protein linked to the formation of tau tangles and cell death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this effect was only seen with some forms of tau, and tau concentrations sprung back up within 24 hours of taking the sleeping pill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If you can reduce tau phosphorylation, potentially there would be less tangle formation and less neuronal death," &lt;a href="https://medicine.wustl.edu/news/sleeping-pill-reduces-levels-of-alzheimers-proteins/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Lucey, still hopeful that &lt;a href="https://medicine.wustl.edu/news/does-improving-sleep-reduce-signs-of-early-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;future studies in older adults&lt;/a&gt; testing sleeping pills for months could possibly measure a lasting effect on protein levels (whilst noting any downsides of sleeping pills).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this all rests on our understanding of what causes Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leading theory, that abnormal protein clumps drive Alzheimer's pathology, has come &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/reigning-theory-of-alzheimer-s-may-be-based-on-fraudulent-images-per-new-report"&gt;under intense scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; lately after decades of research aimed at lowering amyloid levels has not translated into any useful drug or therapy that actually prevents or slows the disease. This has &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-might-not-actually-be-a-brain-disease-expert-says"&gt;prompted researchers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-have-a-new-theory-about-what-causes-alzheimers-and-its-not-plaque"&gt;to rethink&lt;/a&gt; how Alzheimer's disease develops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, sleeping pills may help some people get some shut-eye but using them as a preventative treatment to ward off Alzheimer's disease is still a hazy prospect that hangs on a now-shaky hypothesis of Alzheimer's pathology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, there is increasing evidence linking sleep disturbances to Alzheimer's disease, a disease for which no treatments exist. Lucey says improving sleep hygiene and seeking treatment for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/link-between-alzheimer-s-disease-and-sleep-apnea-discovered-in-brain-tissue"&gt;sleep problems such as sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt; are both sensible approaches to improving general brain health at any age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm hopeful that we will eventually develop drugs that take advantage of the link between sleep and Alzheimer's to prevent cognitive decline," &lt;a href="https://medicine.wustl.edu/news/sleeping-pill-reduces-levels-of-alzheimers-proteins/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Lucey. But he admitted, "We're not quite there yet."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ana.26641"&gt;Annals of Neurology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in April 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

By monitoring brain activity during a visual task, researchers found that the intralaminar and medial thalamic nuclei activated before the prefrontal cortex, suggesting the thalamus initiates conscious awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This thalamus-to-cortex signal synchronization challenges the traditional view that cortical regions alone are the seat of perception. These findings deepen our understanding of how brain circuits give rise to consciousness and highlight a vital role for subcortical structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Activator:&lt;/strong&gt; Intralaminar thalamic regions activate before the prefrontal cortex during perception.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signal Sync:&lt;/strong&gt; Conscious perception coincides with synchronized thalamus–PFC activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thalamic Gateway:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings support a gating role for the thalamus in driving conscious awareness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;AAAS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using direct, intracranial brain recordings in humans, a new study finds that the thalamus, a small region located deep within the brain, plays a pivotal role in conscious perception. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the authors, specific high-order thalamic regions act as a gateway to awareness by sending signals to the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings shed new light on the mysteries of human consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108377"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-conscious-perception-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-conscious-perception-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-conscious-perception-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-conscious-perception-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-conscious-perception-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-conscious-perception-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-conscious-perception-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-conscious-perception-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and a key." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-conscious-perception-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-conscious-perception-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-conscious-perception-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-conscious-perception-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-conscious-perception-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-conscious-perception-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/thalamus-conscious-perception-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Its role in conscious perception has often been seen as merely facilitating sensory information. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the neural foundations of human consciousness is among the most challenging tasks in neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research has suggested that consciousness can be divided into two components: the conscious state (i.e., awake or asleep) and conscious content (i.e., specific experiences or perceptions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While subcortical structures are primarily involved in regulating conscious states, many theories emphasize the importance of subcortical-cortical loops in conscious perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, most studies on conscious perception have focused on the cerebral cortex, with relatively few studies examining the role of subcortical regions, particularly the thalamus. Its role in conscious perception has often been seen as merely facilitating sensory information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand the role of the thalamus in conscious perception, Zepeng Fang and colleagues performed a unique clinical experiment and simultaneously recorded stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) activity in the intralaminar, medial, and ventral thalamic nuclei and prefrontal cortex (PFC), while five chronic, drug-resistant headache patients with implanted intracranial electrodes performed a novel visual consciousness task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feng &lt;em&gt;et al.&lt;/em&gt; discovered that the intralaminar and medial thalamic nuclei exhibited earlier and stronger consciousness-related neural activity compared to the ventral nuclei and PFC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the authors found that activity between the thalamus and PFC – especially the intraluminal thalamus – was synchronized during the onset of conscious perception, suggesting that this thalamic region plays a gating role in driving PFC activity during conscious perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this consciousness and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c5b6a6acb5a4ae85a4a4a4b6ebaab7a2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Science Press Package Team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://aaas.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;AAAS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Science Press Package Team – AAAS&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adr3675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Human high-order thalamic nuclei gate conscious perception through the thalamofrontal loop&lt;/a&gt;” by Hulin Zhao et al. &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human high-order thalamic nuclei gate conscious perception through the thalamofrontal loop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploring the neural substrates underlying human consciousness is one of the most exciting and challenging tasks in modern science. There are at least two distinct modes of consciousness: the conscious state (awake, asleep, and coma, etc.) and the conscious content (specific conscious experience). Human high-order thalamic nuclei activity is known to closely correlate with conscious states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is not clear how those thalamic nuclei and thalamocortical interactions directly contribute to the transient process (which occurs on a millisecond scale) of human conscious perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas most studies have focused the search for the neural correlates of conscious perception on the cerebral cortex, relatively few studies have explored the functional role of subcortical structures, including high-order thalamic nuclei.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently it has been hypothesized that the high-order thalamic nuclei act as gates to modulate cortical activity during conscious perception; however, there is a lack of direct empirical evidence from human studies to support such argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;RATIONALE&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thalamus has been conventionally assumed to act as a prerequisite of sensory information for conscious perception rather than directly contributing to it. However, this assumption has been challenged by novel theoretical hypothesis and empirical evidence, mostly from anatomy and neuroimaging studies, which have shown the direct involvement of the human thalamus in various cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although several theories of consciousness have proposed that the thalamocortical loops might play a critical role in human conscious perception, it is largely unknown how consciousness-related information is processed and transferred within these loops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, because there is great functional heterogeneity across thalamic nuclei, it is necessary to identify the respective roles of different thalamic nucleus in conscious perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, precisely capturing neural activity with high spatial and temporal resolution in human thalamic nuclei and in thalamocortical loops is very difficult owing to technical restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simultaneous intracranial recordings from human thalamic nuclei and thalamocortical loops provide an excellent opportunity to elucidate the dynamic process of thalamocortical loops during the emergence of conscious perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We simultaneously recorded stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) data from multiple thalamic nuclei and prefrontal cortex (PFC) while patients were performing a novel visual consciousness task. In this task, the matched saccadic response between the conscious and unconscious conditions largely minimized the confusion of report-related activity with consciousness-related activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with the ventral nuclei and PFC, the intralaminar and medial nuclei presented earlier and stronger consciousness-related activity, including both event-related potential (ERP) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transient thalamofrontal neural synchrony and cross-frequency coupling were both driven by the θ phase (2 to 8 Hz) of the activity in intralaminar and medial nuclei during the emergence of conscious perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coupling between these two thalamic nuclei and lateral PFC (LPFC) was stronger than that between these nuclei and other PFC subregions during conscious perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further decoding analysis of the stimulus-evoked activity in the intralaminar and medial nuclei and LPFC showed that the accuracy was highest when decoding conscious perception (conscious versus unconscious) compared with decoding other task-related events (such as stimulus contrast, rule cues, saccade direction, and saccade reaction time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We provide direct sEEG evidence in the human brain that supports the gate role of the intralaminar and medial nuclei in the rapid process of conscious perception. More specifically, the intralaminar and medial nuclei play a more important role than the ventral nuclei during the emergence of conscious perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interaction between the LPFC and intralaminar and medial nuclei, which originates from the intralaminar and medial nuclei, may play an essential role during conscious perception. Moreover, the stimulus-evoked activity in the thalamofrontal loop primarily encodes consciousness-related information rather than other task-relevant events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results support the argument that the intralaminar and medial thalamic nuclei play a gate role to modulate the activity of PFC during the emergence of conscious perception.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 22:19:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE9OMU5WSGstdDNfd1ZjRzVRS2l2c21YVUdMMWRDRG8ya2lDbk1iT2ZaeFNzbXFZWURvZ1RpQUNkV0xYTFJOblkzSjhmb1Ftb2YwNm53UFlweW5BbkxzVkZySmQ4MHdTbzBTbmUyQ0NVQlJaem8</guid></item><item><title>People in this rural California town are dying of the virus that killed Gene Hackman’s wife - San Francisco Chronicle</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQbFJRWndlSnNtc0VlNjhYdDJDTHNJclVPeWRkTEVibFRINVlScW8wSUVtMENrNGdvTFY2RlFEVjB4d1BDUm1hSVNaSTBJWUVqNDYzelNSWUNBeWhFenl1YmNSS3BzM25hQkhhaW5UNlZqQ2wwb1BTS2R4SURDb3lURkFzRFdPQlU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="rel"&gt;&lt;figure class="rel f m0 fdc -mx20 sm:-mx40 lg:-mx56 x100vw sm:cw-80 lg:cw-112 mb32"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="mediaCaptionAria" class="f fdc g2 rel pt8 px20 sm:px0 rel"&gt;&lt;span class="photoCaption c-gray700 block ya"&gt;&lt;div data-server-side-rendered="true" class="r12zgbl0"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third person in Mammoth Lakes died of hantavirus, a respiratory illness caused by exposure to deer mice waste. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="photoCredit c-gray600 block rel z1 mt2 mr48"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brian van der Brug/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three people in Mammoth Lakes (Mono County) have died of hantavirus, the rodent-borne &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/hantavirus-gene-hackman-wife-betsy-arakawa-20209276.php" data-link="native" class=""&gt;virus that killed Gene Hackman’s wife, Betsy Arakawa&lt;/a&gt;, health officials announced Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human cases of hantavirus — which spreads through contact with infected deer mice — are rare.

The Santa Fe medical examiner announced that &lt;a href="https://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/omi-gene-hackman-died-of-heart-disease-in-santa-fe-wife-betsy-arakawa-had-hantavirus/article_f2eb0a38-f9d5-11ef-9e7d-9be7ad9c0090.html" data-link="native" class=""&gt;Arakawa died from hantavirus&lt;/a&gt; and Hackman outlived her by up to a week before succumbing to heart disease and Alzheimer’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The identities of Mammoth Lakes residents was not made public as of Thursday, though public health officials referred to the latest victim as a “young adult.” Investigators found no evidence of mouse activity inside the person’s home, and it was unclear where they would have been exposed to rodent droppings or saliva. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three people contracted the illness in February while living in Mammoth Lakes, a town of 7,000 in the Sierra Nevada about 50 miles east of Yosemite National Park surrounded by ski areas and trails. Mono County health officials called their deaths “tragic and alarming.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The timing and circumstances of the deaths was atypical, said Dr. Tom Boo, Mono County public health officer. Hantavirus infections most commonly occur in the late spring or summer when people are exposed to the urine, droppings or saliva of wild rodents like deer mice — particularly by inhaling contaminants in the air. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As far as we know, none of these deceased individuals engaged in activities typically associated with exposure, such as cleaning out poorly ventilated indoor areas or outbuildings with a lot of mouse waste,” Boo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="CONCERT1" data-large-id="CONCERT2" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health officials believe that a boom in the deer mouse population may be to blame. Deer mouse numbers were “high this year in Mammoth and probably elsewhere in the Eastern Sierra,” increasing the likelihood of human infections, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boo said it was “crucial” that California residents take precautions such as trapping rodents, airing out enclosed spaces and keeping food in rodent-proof containers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incubation period following a hantavirus infection typically lasts weeks and usually begins as a flu-like illness. Symptoms can include fever, fatigue and muscle aches, then move on to headaches, dizziness, chills, abdominal problems, coughing and shortness of breath, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 1 in 3 people who contract the virus die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prompt diagnosis and treatment can increase a person’s chance of survival, but testing is “only available in specialized laboratories, making early recognition challenging,” health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="B300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;California is familiar with the deadly rodent-borne illness.

In some cases, a supplement might interfere with your prescription drug. In other situations, an herb might slow metabolism of the medicine and increase the possibility of side effects. It’s better to know which pills don’t get along well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could listen through your local public radio station or get the live stream at 7 am EDT on your computer or smart phone (&lt;a href="https://www.wunc.org"&gt;wunc.org&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;a href="https://www.peoplespharmacy.com/find-a-radio-station"&gt;Here is a link&lt;/a&gt;  so you can find which stations carry our broadcast. If you can’t listen to the broadcast, you may wish to hear the podcast later. You can subscribe through your favorite podcast provider, download the mp3 using the link at the bottom of the page, or listen to the stream on this post starting on April 7, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting Information on Supplements &amp;amp; Herbs:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you have a question about supplements or herbs, you probably go to the web for answers. But while there is plenty of information out there, not all of it is reliable. We start this episode by talking with a pharmacist who does research for one of the sites we use as a favorite resource, &lt;a href="https://examine.com"&gt;Examine.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The site has long provided information on what a product is supposed to do and how well it might do that thing. It also offers information on dosing and on quality. For example, if you look up turmeric, you’ll learn that Meriva and BCM95 are standardized extracts that have been used in a number of randomized controlled trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Examine is going beyond efficacy and looking at safety. Because there is less information available about safety, even for medications, this has been more challenging. We especially appreciate that the summaries are succinct and easy to understand and that the statements are supported by peer-reviewed research. Checking Examine.com is a good place to start learning about potential incompatibilities among supplements, herbs and medicines you are taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Does Grapefruit Have to Do with It?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recognize that grapefruit is not an herb or a supplement. It is certainly not a medication, although it is a great source of vitamin C and regular consumption of grapefruit can help control cholesterol (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22304836/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;, July 2012&lt;/a&gt;).  Nonetheless, it is important to our topic, because scientists discovered a potent interaction between grapefruit juice and certain prescription drug many decades ago (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1671113/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt;, Feb. 2, 1991&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although grapefruit inhibits the CYP3A4 enzyme that metabolizes many medicines, it is not the only plant product that can affect them. This was a wake-up call for us and for many health professionals to pay attention to interactions among supplements, herbs and medicines. Like grapefruit, both ginger and berberine inhibit CYP3A4. St. John’s wort, on the other hand, induces the enzyme, which means that the target medication may be less effective. If it is an oral contraceptive or a drug to prevent transplant rejection, you need to know that!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Pharmacists Can Help:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pharmacists stand ready to help people review their supplements, herbs and medicines to see if there are potential interactions, redundancies, adverse reactions or other problems. Technically, everyone on Medicare is entitled to a comprehensive medication review annually. Some pharmacists like to conduct that as a “brown bag review,” in which the patient brings in everything they are taking–OTC med, prescription drugs, herbs, vitamins and other dietary supplements–so the pharmacist gets a complete picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, it may even be helpful to talk about food and drink. We already mentioned grapefruit. During this interview, we also bring up research showing that hibiscus tea (which can lower blood pressure) could interact with the cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin (&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28925046/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Clinical Pharmacy and Therapeutics&lt;/em&gt;, Dec. 2017&lt;/a&gt;).  Hibiscus tea itself lowers cholesterol well. However, it interacts with simvastatin and reduces the drug’s effectiveness. The authors of the study advise against co-administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;This Week’s Guests:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katie Jantz, MS, RPh is a researcher on the staff for &lt;a href="https://examine.com/"&gt;Examine.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="attachment_134649" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-134649" class="size-full wp-image-134649" src="https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/peoplespharmacy/Katie_Jantz_RPh.jpg" alt="Katie Jantz, RPh, for Examine describes interactions of supplements, herbs and medicines" srcset="https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/peoplespharmacy/znVY7BKb-Katie_Jantz_RPh-150x150.jpg 150w, https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/peoplespharmacy/Katie_Jantz_RPh-200x200.jpg 200w, https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/peoplespharmacy/znVY7BKb-Katie_Jantz_RPh-120x120.jpg 120w, https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/peoplespharmacy/Katie_Jantz_RPh-240x240.jpg 240w, https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/peoplespharmacy/Katie_Jantz_RPh.jpg 256w" sizes="(max-width: 256px) 100vw, 256px"&gt;&lt;p id="caption-attachment-134649" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Katie Jantz, MS, RPh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stefanie Ferreri, PharmD, is the Henry L.

After it is placed in or on the heart, it’s paired with another small, patch-like device worn on the patient’s chest. When the device on the chest detects irregular heartbeats it emits pulses of light into the chest that activate the pacemaker, delivering electrical stimulation to the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device is designed for patients who need a pacemaker only temporarily. It dissolves into the patient’s body once it’s no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineers were initially inspired to create the device for infants with congenital heart defects. About&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heart-defects/data/index.html#:~:text=Babies%20born%20with%20heart%20defects&amp;amp;text=Heart%20defects%20affect%20nearly%201,year%20in%20the%20United%20States.&amp;amp;text=The%20prevalence%20of%20some%20heart,is%20a%20ventricular%20septal%20defect."&gt; 40,000 babies in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; are born with heart defects each year, and about a fourth of those “generally need surgery or other procedures in their first year of life,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After surgery, the infants typically need a pacemaker for about a week while their hearts heal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some adults also need temporary pacemakers, such as after an aortic valve replacement or bypass surgery, Efimov said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In such cases, surgeons now must often sew a wire onto the heart that’s attached to an external box that delivers a current to control the heart’s rhythm. When the pacemaker is no longer needed, surgeons must remove the wire from the heart, which can introduce complications such as bleeding, damage to the heart muscle and infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a complication contributed to the death of astronaut Neil Armstrong in 2012, when he started bleeding internally as wires of a temporary pacemaker were being removed, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/us/neil-armstrong-wrongful-death-settlement.html"&gt;the New York Times reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Even though it’s exceedingly rare, it could be lethal,” Efimov said of complications of removing traditional, temporary pacemakers. “We wanted to create a pacemaker which would be, first of all, much, much smaller compared to what it is now, fully implantable so there’s nothing external, so there’s no risk of infections, but more importantly, it’s transient. It serves a purpose for whatever number of days or weeks it’s required, and after that it will dissolve.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper published Wednesday showed how researchers have used the small, implantable device so far in mice, rats, a dog and in hearts from deceased humans and pigs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the team hopes to get approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to begin clinical trials in humans. Efimov and Northwestern bioelectrics expert John Rogers, who co-authored the study and led development of the device, co-founded a company at Northwestern called NuSera Biosystems that will work to further develop the device and eventually bring it to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gaurav Upadhyay, an electrophysiologist and associate professor of medicine at the University of Chicago, called the study “exciting.” Upadhyay was not involved in the device’s development or the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new pacemaker is “impressively smaller than anything else we have available,” Upadhyay said. “If this can be confirmed in clinical trials, I think that there are incredible applications for short-term pacing requirements, which will have the potential to be used in a variety of clinical settings.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest TikTok beauty craze is eggs-actly what dermatologists don’t want you to try: rubbing raw egg whites on your face.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/01/05/expert-warns-against-viral-skincare-trend-using-egg-whites-to-remove-blackheads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;DIY skincare hype&lt;/a&gt; on the platform, experts warn raw egg white facials have more risks than rewards — plus, no clinical evidence they erase bags, creases and folds.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While supporters claim that these one-ingredient masks reduce wrinkles and shrink pores, experts caution against applying these to your visage due to possible allergic reactions, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/23/business/costco-egg-recall-raised-to-highest-risk-level-due-to-salmonella-concerns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;salmonella&lt;/a&gt; exposure, and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/07/13/tiktok-microwave-egg-hack-literally-blows-up-in-womans-face/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;skin irritation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
Although DIY skincare trends like these are popular on social media, specialists caution that using raw egg white facials carries significant risks and lacks scientific proof of reducing under-eye bags, wrinkles, and fine lines. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;TikTok / @byzareefa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Egg whites are rich in protein and collagen, which benefit your skin when consumed, rather than applied as a face mask, according to Melanie Abeyta, an aesthetic nurse practitioner, licensed master injector, and owner of Harmony Aesthetics Center in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She &lt;a href="https://www.hola.com/us/beauty/20250331823492/egg-whites-facial-beauty-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;shared with ¡Hola!&lt;/a&gt; that she is “not a huge supporter of this trend” that has resurfaced on TikTok over the past few weeks, believing that the “risks outweigh the benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“One of the main risks is an allergic reaction,” Abeyta stressed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She added that “many people are allergic to eggs; therefore, if you are allergic to eating them, you should definitely stay away from putting them on your face.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although you might not have a confirmed allergy, you could still be sensitive to egg whites, she said, noting the “potential for a small amount to be ingested which will cause significant discomfort.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The aesthetics specialist went on to say that using egg whites topically can likely cause skin irritation, even if you don’t have an allergy, sensitivity, or intolerance to them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Experts advise against putting unprocessed food on your skin, particularly if you have sensitive or irritated areas, or open sores from acne, due to the risk of infection. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;TikTok / @selinadasilvaa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s never recommended to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/28/lifestyle/beauty-influencers-are-rubbing-garlic-on-their-faces-to-clear-acne-heres-what-the-experts-say/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;apply raw food to your skin&lt;/a&gt;, especially if you have sensitive skin, irritated skin or open wounds (like from acne) as there is always the potential for infection,” she warned. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The outlet additionally shared that Dr. Adil Sheraz, a specialist in skin conditions, informed The Sun that the likelihood of getting infections like Salmonella is significant when using raw egg facials, especially for those who are immunocompromised, children, and pregnant women.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, Sheraz noted that there is no evidence from trials to support the idea that raw egg whites can lessen the appearance of wrinkles. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Using raw egg whites for facials can pose a high risk of infections such as Salmonella, particularly for individuals with weakened immune systems, children, and pregnant women. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;TikTok / @byzareefa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Joshua Zeichner, director of cosmetic and clinical research in Dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, agreed, &lt;a href="https://www.byrdie.com/egg-whites-for-acne-5079149" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;telling Byrdie&lt;/a&gt;, “The information we have on the use of egg whites is all anecdotal and I have not seen any scientific studies showing any definitive data.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On TikTok, influencer @byzareefa recently &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@byzareefa/video/7478157248238193966" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;filmed herself&lt;/a&gt;  breaking an egg into a bowl. She then removed the yolk to access the egg whites, whipped them with a fork until they appeared “soapy,” and applied the concoction to her face with her fingers, claiming it would minimize pores.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fellow content creator @selinadasilvaa also &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@selinadasilvaa/video/7479541019239861526" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;made a video&lt;/a&gt; last month for the same reason, and applied her egg white facial with a makeup brush. She noted that she often leaves the mask on for ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A key risk of using this mask is an allergic reaction. Even without a known allergy, you might still be sensitive to egg whites, possibly leading to discomfort if a small amount is ingested. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images/iStockphoto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This spring, user @booombala &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@booombala/video/7485131546865749270?q=egg%20white%20face&amp;amp;t=1743699444592" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; a well-known technique popular among BeautyTok enthusiasts — applying egg whites to the face, then placing two layers of tissue paper on top, creating a sandwich effect with more egg whites in between.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, if you really want smoother, more supple skin, it’s best to skip the raw eggs altogether and stick to actual skincare products, Abeyta advised. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There are many better skincare solutions, such as using ingredients that are meant for your skincare, such as hyaluronic acid, peptides, niacinamide, vitamin C, and retinol,” she explained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;
For truly smoother and more supple skin, it’s advisable to avoid using raw eggs and tissue paper tricks altogether and instead rely on genuine skincare products, according to specialists. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;TikTok / @booombala&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;




&lt;p&gt;However, if you’re determined to smear on kitchen staples, Abeyta has some safer suggestions. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;She revealed that you can try using oatmeal, which can be a “great exfoliator,” or classic cucumbers for &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/03/health/massage-therapist-tricks-for-spa-level-relaxation-at-home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;soothing your eye area&lt;/a&gt; on a budget.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can also opt for “cold” green tea bags for relieving puffiness around your peepers, as well as “honey for hydration” in dry areas of the face. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given that diet significantly impacts our overall health, including the condition of our skin, she further  recommended &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/27/health/celeb-dermatologists-3-day-nutritional-facelift-diet-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;prioritizing an anti-inflammatory&lt;/a&gt;, probiotic-rich diet rich in fresh fruits and water. &lt;/p&gt;

But a lot of risk factors are still a total mystery. Recently, scientists uncovered a new one, and it’s probably not one that's on your radar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, where you live can actually influence how likely you are to develop dementia, according to a new study published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000213464" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Neurology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Neurology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Yep, your neighborhood plays a bigger role in your disease risk than people thought. But suddenly moving houses isn’t an option for most people, so, what can you do about it? Neurologists break down the findings and explain what they mean for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil, DO;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil, DO&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA; &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev, MD, MS;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev, MD, MS&lt;/a&gt;, medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the study, researchers analyzed data from 6,781 people with an average age of 72 who lived in four different communities in Chicago. The participants were given tests for thinking and memory skills at the beginning of the study, as well as every three years for at least six years. During the study, 2,534 people were also evaluated for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers took that information and compared it to U.S. Census data to look at how disadvantaged each neighborhood was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the study, 11 percent of people who lived in the least disadvantaged neighborhoods developed Alzheimer’s disease, while 22 percent of people in the most disadvantaged neighborhood received a diagnosis. In the neighborhoods in-between these two, the rates increased with the level of disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for a slew of factors that can influence dementia risk, like age, sex, and education level, the researchers discovered that people in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods were more than twice as likely to develop dementia compared to those who lived in nicer areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is dementia risk linked with certain types of neighborhoods?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to point out that the study simply found an association between where you live and a higher dementia risk. So that means it didn’t &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; that living in certain neighborhoods causes dementia—just that there’s a link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, “zip code is a major determinant of overall health,” says &lt;a href="https://neurology.msu.edu/directory/amit-sachdev" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Amit Sachdev, MD,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Amit Sachdev, MD,&lt;/a&gt; medical director in the Department of Neurology at Michigan State University. It specifically falls under something known as a “&lt;a href="https://odphp.health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/social-determinants-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:social determinant of health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;social determinant of health&lt;/a&gt;,” which is a non-medical factor that influences a person’s health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who live in disadvantaged neighborhoods tend to have a greater risk of developing conditions like diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure, and those are also risk factors for dementia, points out &lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/profile/203880-clifford-segil" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Clifford Segil, DO;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Clifford Segil, DO&lt;/a&gt;, a neurologist at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else raises your dementia risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few risk factors for dementia to keep in mind. While some, like your genetics, age, and race, are out of your control, there are certain lifestyle factors that will raise your risk of dementia. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimers.gov/life-with-dementia/can-i-prevent-dementia#what-are-risk-factors" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Institute on Aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Institute on Aging&lt;/a&gt; (NIA), those include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;High blood pressure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lack of physical activity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uncontrolled diabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having overweight or obesity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being socially isolated or lonely&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the NIA also points out that researchers haven’t proven that avoiding certain behaviors or lifestyle factors will actually prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I best protect my brain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to support good brain health is to focus on your overall health, Dr. Sachdev says. “The brain that is very healthy is usually supported by a very healthy body,” he says. “A brain that is very healthy will be able to withstand changes more robustly than a brain that is less healthy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structure is also important for brain health, Dr. Segil says. “Find activities that stimulate both your mind and your body,” he says. “Do them in regular weekly routine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to your risk of developing dementia, doctors generally agree that you should just do what you can to stay healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 19:39:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxOUHBiWFk3Wjk2U3g2ZjA5Z2pWR1VWNGthemV4X1JBejF2QVp4UF9FQWw2cEppMVBkaVVIVnNHeDVWeGhUeExpcmt4eVl6NS1XZzFmY2FiTUY0M1pBeTY4eERqWE1VQ3RCcm45MTNNakxTMGUzM25zV05tOWVYZkFOa1ZNOA</guid></item><item><title>Former Arcata Resident Featured in BBC News Story Exploring Medically Assisted Death in California - Lost Coast Outpost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXkFVX3lxTFB0eXFCNEtscld0VnUzVmpIMGUycFBWOEducHBoZTlxdG5nYmdLT29keG5xenpvQUFmYW5NNm02emI5UWhFUjJsNURxRUM5QlFueTFBYmROWGdtU3IxbEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-text" class="article-text"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As members of the British Parliament debate proposed legislation that would allow medically assisted death for terminally ill adults in England and Wales, &lt;i&gt;BBC News&lt;/i&gt; published an article this week detailing one man’s experience with the process here in California. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thought-provoking piece — &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rgd4yrz3eo"&gt;linked here&lt;/a&gt; — tells the story of 80-year-old Wayne Hawkins, a former resident of Arcata, who, after suffering from chronic pain, heart failure and “a myriad of other health issues,” decided to pursue medical aid-in-dying, which was legalized in California through the End of Life Options Act of 2016. The law allows terminally ill adults with a life expectancy of six months or less and the mental capacity to make the choice to request medication that will hasten their death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Hawkins’ request was approved by two doctors, he invited&lt;i&gt; BBC News&lt;/i&gt; to his San Diego home to share his perspective on the controversial aid-in-dying process and observe his final day alongside his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Britain is pretty good with freedoms and this is just another one,” Hawkins told &lt;i&gt;BBC News&lt;/i&gt;. “People should be able to choose the time of their death as long as they meet the rules like six months to live or less.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While proponents of medically assisted death — often dubbed “death with dignity” — view the process as a compassionate option for people facing terminal illness and suffering, opponents argue that it is morally wrong. Dr. Vincent Nguyen, a palliative care specialist interviewed in the &lt;i&gt;BBC’s&lt;/i&gt; article, asserted that aid-in-dying laws “lead to ‘silent coercion’ whereby vulnerable people think their only option is to die.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The article’s author, Medical Editor Fergus Walsh, continues:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a story about one man’s death in California - it’s about what could become a reality here in England and Wales for those who qualify for an assisted death and choose to die this way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re for or against the proposed new Westminster law, the death of a loved one is a deeply personal and emotional time for a family. Each death leaves an imprint, as will Wayne’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;LINK: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rgd4yrz3eo"&gt;California man invites BBC to witness his death as MPs debate assisted dying&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                            &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A switch of just two weeks from a traditional African diet to a Western diet causes inflammation, reduces the immune response to pathogens, and activates processes associated with lifestyle diseases. Conversely, an African diet rich in vegetables, fiber, and fermented foods has positive effects. This study, published in Nature Medicine, highlights the significant impact of diet on the immune system and metabolism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and chronic inflammatory conditions are surging across Africa, posing a growing challenge to healthcare systems throughout the continent. Increasing economic development, urbanization and wider availability of processed foods have accelerated the adoption of Western eating habits in Africa. To understand the health consequences of this shift, researchers from Radboud university medical center and KCMC University in Tanzania have studied the effects of such dietary changes on health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle diseases&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seventy-seven healthy men from Tanzania, both urban and rural residents, participated in the study. Some participants who traditionally ate an African diet switched to a Western diet for two weeks, while others who ate a Western diet adopted a traditional African diet. A third group consumed a fermented banana drink daily. As a control, ten participants maintained their usual diet. The researchers comprehensively analyzed the function of the immune system, blood inflammation markers, and metabolic processes at baseline, after the two-week intervention, and again four weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Participants who switched to a Western diet exhibited an increase in inflammatory proteins in their blood, alongside activation of biological processes linked to lifestyle diseases. Their immune cells also responded less effectively to pathogens. Meanwhile, those who switched to a traditional African diet or consumed the fermented drink showed a reduction in inflammatory markers. Some of these effects persisted even four weeks later, indicating that short-term dietary changes can have long-lasting effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insights from Africa&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first study to comprehensively map the health effects of a traditional African diet. 'Previous research has focused on other traditional diets, such as the Japanese or Mediterranean diet', says internist Quirijn de Mast from Radboudumc. 'However, there is just as much to learn from traditional African diets, especially now, as lifestyles in many African regions are rapidly changing and lifestyle diseases are increasing. Africa's rich diversity in traditional diets offers unique opportunities to gain valuable insights into how food influences health.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;De Mast finds it remarkable how significant the effects of diet are, even after just two weeks. 'The African diet includes plenty of vegetables, fruits, beans, whole grains, and fermented foods. Our study highlights the benefits of these traditional food products for inflammation and metabolic processes in the body. At the same time, we show how harmful an unhealthy Western diet can be. It typically consists of processed and high-calorie foods, such as French fries and white bread, with excessive salt, refined sugars, and saturated fats. Inflammation is at the root of many chronic conditions, which makes this study highly relevant for Western countries as well.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radboudumc and KCMC University collaborated on this study with international partners from Bonn and Florence. The research was funded by ZonMw/JPI-HDHL. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have discovered a new mechanism that acts via an immune cell and points toward a different way of treating chronic pain. Female hormones can suppress pain by making immune cells near the spinal cord produce opioids, a new study by researchers at UC San Francisco has found. This stops pain signals before they get to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The discovery could help with developing new treatments for chronic pain. It may also explain why some painkillers work better for women than men and why &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/postmenopausal+women/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;postmenopausal women&lt;/a&gt; experience more pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work reveals an entirely new role for T-regulatory &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt; (T-regs), which are known for their ability to reduce inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The fact that there's a sex-dependent influence on these cells—driven by estrogen and progesterone—and that it's not related at all to any immune function is very unusual," said Elora Midavaine, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow. She is the first author of the study, which &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adq6531" target="_blank"&gt;appears&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at T-regs in the protective layers that encase the brain and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/spinal+cord/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;spinal cord&lt;/a&gt; in mice. Until now, scientists thought these tissues, called the meninges, only served to protect the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/central+nervous+system/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;central nervous system&lt;/a&gt; and eliminate waste. T-regs were only discovered there in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What we are showing now is that the immune system actually uses the meninges to communicate with distant neurons that detect sensation on the skin," said Sakeen Kashem, MD, Ph.D., an assistant professor of dermatology. "This is something we hadn't known before."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;That communication begins when a neuron, often near the skin, senses something that could cause pain. The neuron then sends a signal to the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team found that the meninges surrounding the lower part of the spinal cord harbor an abundance of T-regs. To learn what their function was, the researchers knocked the cells out with a toxin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect was striking: Without the T-regs, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/female+mice/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;female mice&lt;/a&gt; became more sensitive to pain, while male mice did not. This sex-specific difference suggested that female mice rely more on T-regs to manage pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It was both fascinating and puzzling," said Kashem, who co-led the study with Allan Basbaum, Ph.D. "It actually made me skeptical initially."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further experiments revealed a relationship between T-regs and female hormones that no one had seen before: Estrogen and progesterone were prompting the cells to churn out painkilling enkephalin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly how the hormones do this is a question the team hopes to answer in a future study. But even without that understanding, the awareness of this sex-dependent pathway is likely to lead to much-needed new approaches for treating pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the short run, it may help physicians choose medications that could be more effective for a patient, depending on their sex. Certain migraine treatments, for example, are known to work better on women than men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be particularly helpful for women who have gone through menopause and no longer produce estrogen and progesterone, many of whom experience chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers have begun looking into the possibility of engineering T-regs to produce enkephalin on a constant basis in both men and women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If that approach is successful, it could really change the lives of the nearly 20% of Americans who experience &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/chronic+pain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;chronic pain&lt;/a&gt; that is not adequately treated," Basbaum said.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Thirty previously laid-off staff members at the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Division of Intramural Research—including 11 lab heads—should “immediately return to work,” according to an NINDS Office of Human Resources email sent to top administration at the institute Wednesday evening. Some of the layoff notices sent this week were the result of a coding error that mislabeled some employees with incorrect position codes, according to an NINDS employee who is not authorized to speak publicly and requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who should return to work include the &lt;a href="https://www.thetransmitter.org/science-and-society/u-s-health-agency-purge-includes-10-lab-heads-at-national-institute-of-neurological-disorders-and-stroke/"&gt;10 NINDS lab heads&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Transmitter&lt;/em&gt; reported on yesterday; an additional principal investigator not included in that report, &lt;a href="https://research.ninds.nih.gov/staff-directory/zu-hang-sheng-phd" target="_blank"&gt;Zu-Hang Sheng&lt;/a&gt;, was also reinstated, according to the email. The lab heads who were sent reduction-in-force notices had been incorrectly labeled with job codes that differ from the job code for other principal investigators within the institute, the anonymous NINDS employee says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The email—a photo of which was shared with &lt;em&gt;The Transmitter—&lt;/em&gt;lists the 30 staff members and reads, “NIH leadership has informed us that the individuals below should be contacted ASAP and told immediately return to work.” Three senior scientists and staff in the Office of Research Training and Career Development, in the Office of the Scientific Director and in building facilities were also among those on the list. Almost all of the 30 people received the reduction-in-force notice earlier this week, but a few were probationary employees who had been laid off in February, the source says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am infuriated at the inefficiency of the time wasted by staff running around having to respond to these events, heartbroken for the emotional cost for hardworking, dedicated civil servants and scientific trainees just starting their careers,” the anonymous NINDS employee says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The email says that the employees’ reduction-in-force notices “are not cancelled, however, NIH leadership is actively working on a long-term solution.” The Office of Human Resources “leadership and staff have no additional information to provide and asks that questions be directed to your leadership,” the email continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thousands of employees across federal health agencies &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/trump-administration-purges-u-s-health-agency-leaders" target="_blank"&gt;received reduction-in-force notices&lt;/a&gt; this week following &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-human-services-layoffs-restructuring-rfk-jr-fa4e89285e668a3939e20b6cf4c26fd4" target="_blank"&gt;last week’s announcement&lt;/a&gt; from Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services that he would restructure the department and lay off 10,000 workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 1,200 National Institutes of Health (NIH) probationary employees also received &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/more-nih-job-cuts-coming-agency-scientists-already-reeling-after-week-firings" target="_blank"&gt;termination notices&lt;/a&gt; in February, but some have since been &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/nih-reinstates-some-its-early-career-scientists" target="_blank"&gt;reinstated&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The rash usually begins as flat red spots that appear on the face at the hairline and spread downward to the neck, torso, arms, legs, and feet. Measles can also cause serious complications, such as pneumonia and encephalitis (swelling of the brain), and can lead to miscarriage in pregnant people, premature birth, or a low-birth-weight baby.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News 12 - New Jersey</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 17:00:36 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixgFBVV95cUxQTm9EQ0hHTll0Ny1iTmJwME04OVFvT0ZwcHFZN1UtOWluWnV5SnFySGZPNHlHaWpIcmR4UVUwLWxHaldtcElkeDNNS0hzamxneXlraHJOVHhCSXNydWhSRnV4RmM1S1ljWHlrM05uM3psQzFxQ2JDelg3V3RnOE1FalZRenl0d3dLVktIRnZFVDhHSndicllKZ0RGanljQkVWX2xNYzNMU0QtZkc4dEROdmN6bXUyeENmY1VSZjVKbnFMOHRSNlE</guid></item><item><title>Seven signs you’re deficient in B12 and how to fix it - The Telegraph</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxQdGtsTzVmSWVBbHFuT1NPWW5RdG8zRmgxRUpFa2dhT0tod2JXakNGeXdhRzg1eGxfc3l0UHZqcl9SbFlhRE1WM0pBVUN0aXllYTgycm84UmpuLUVPeUFRXzlOaVp3UUZtMmhfQzlhRHNkemVyak9iOWNxNUpLTE9hVEN5azVHbTJfRm9KVFpYWnlHcjhKY0E1MVNGRm4xU09lbXNKcWUzcWdTVVdf?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="component article-body-text    " data-test="article-body-text"&gt;
  
  

	

	
	

	
	



  
  
    &lt;p&gt;Fatigue and muscle weakness. Memory loss and confusion. Pins and needles. The &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/vitamin-b12-deficiency/"&gt;signs of B12 deficiency&lt;/a&gt; are vague, wide-ranging and usually develop gradually. It’s something that tends to impacts us as we age – but young people can suffer with it too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And new evidence suggests that, as we age, even those who are not “deficient” could be unknowingly experiencing symptoms and would benefit from a higher intake. A &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27200" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;recent American study&lt;/a&gt; of 231 healthy volunteers, whose median age was 71, found that &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/01/01/vitamin-deficiencies-surge-hospital-admission-poverty-nhs/"&gt;those with lower B12 levels&lt;/a&gt; (but still in the normal range) showed signs of neurological and cognitive decline when performing a battery of timed tests in comparison with participants with higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what is B12 doing for us and how do we keep our levels up?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;The seven vitamin B12 deficiency symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“B12 is essential for a functioning nervous system, healthy red blood cell formation and DNA synthesis,” says Dr Sabine Donnai, GP and longevity doctor. “It plays a role in the conversion of protein and fat into energy, and the formation of neurotransmitters and hormones that control our brain function.” B12 is closely linked to folate (also known as B9). They play similar roles in the body and B12 is crucial for folate metabolism – a vital bodily process that allows cells to function properly – and vice versa. “It’s like your right and left arm, they need to be together,” says Donnai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deficiency has a very wide impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;1. Lack of energy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unexplained &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/supplements/vitamin-b12-brain-fog-deficiency-iron-rich-diet/"&gt;general tiredness and fatigue&lt;/a&gt;, maybe breathlessness too, can be a sign of Vitamin B12 deficiency,” says Donnai. “If B12 levels are low, the red blood cells will struggle to form, which means you won’t have enough oxygen delivered to any part of your body or your organs, whether it’s kidneys, brain, heart or lungs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;2. Strange sensations&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These could include burning, numbness or pins and needles in hands, legs and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need B12 to make the ‘myelin sheath’, the protective layer that surrounds nerve cells,” says Dr Geoff Mullan, functional medicine practitioner at Human People. That layer allows for the efficient transmission of our nerve signals. “Without it, you stop conducting so well. If it goes on for long enough, the nerve damage can be permanent.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;3. Unsteadiness on the legs...&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;...Or other difficulties with coordination. This damage to the nerves and spinal cord can also lead to impaired balance and unsteadiness, as well as difficulty with motor skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;4. Memory loss&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need B12 to make new neurotransmitters,” says Mullan. The nerve damage and brain atrophy caused by a B12 deficiency can mirror the symptoms of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;5. Brain fog&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Difficulty thinking and reasoning. People with a vitamin B12 deficiency will often describe being unable to focus or concentrate, and experience difficulties completing tasks. “You’ll struggle to ‘activate’, i.e. start tasks, and also ‘do’, i.e. continue tasks,” says Mullan, “as all your mental and physical systems are struggling.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;6. Depression, agitation, anxiety and mood swings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“B12 is important in the formation of serotonin, which helps regulate mood, sleep and appetite,” says Mullan. It’s also involved in the production of dopamine and norepinephrine, other neurotransmitters that play a key role in mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;7. Poor oral health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recurrent mouth ulcers, painful cracks at the corners of the mouth and a sore, inflamed tongue. “In serious cases, the tongue almost becomes smooth and glossy like the inside of your cheeks, where usually the tongue should be rough,” says Donnai. (This is called “glossitis” and is probably caused by lack of oxygen and nutrients reaching the tongue.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How to diagnose a B12 deficiency&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to test your B12 level through your GP or pharmacy – you can buy at-home tests too. “If you are going to use the at-home tests, make sure they have the CE mark,” says Donnai. One problem with at-home finger-prick tests is that, if not done properly, you can squeeze out serum, dilute the result and get an inaccurate reading. Any results should be taken to the doctor. Understanding whether you have a deficiency is more complicated than a single number, says Donnai. “We usually conduct tests that won’t be done in isolation. It will require measuring haemoglobin levels and red blood cells too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;How to treat a B12 deficiency&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Injection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fastest way to correct a serious deficiency is through a course of B12 injections called hydroxocobalamin, typically given every other day over a two-week period. Injections are the only treatment for people whose deficiency is a result of a condition called pernicious anaemia which prevents the absorption of B12 in the intestine (see “What causes B12 deficiency?”, below). With injection, B12 is delivered directly to the bloodstream, bypassing the digestive system. In cases of pernicious anaemia, injections are required for life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Nasal spray&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an option for people who don’t like injections, again bypassing the digestive system and delivering B12 directly to the bloodstream through the nasal lining. “I am not a fan of sprays as dosing with them can be erratic although absorption is often high,” says Mullan. “The only patients I have seen with dangerously high vitamin D levels are people using sprays.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Tablet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For most people whose B12 deficiency is dietary-related, a high strength tablet works just as well as injections and they are a lot less expensive,” says Mullan. “The best ones are those that are absorbed in the mouth and come in its active form, methylcobalamin.” For adults with diet-related B12 deficiency, the usual dose is 50 to 150 micrograms taken once a day. For adults with a B12 deficiency not caused by diet, it’s one or two 1,000-microgram tablets taken once or twice a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What causes B12 deficiency?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Diet&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/07/11/vitamin-b12-deficiency-warning-nice-elderly-brain-fog-vegan/"&gt;A vegan diet&lt;/a&gt; is probably the biggest cause,” says Donnai. “A B12 deficiency is one of the biggest problems a vegan can face.” B12 is found mainly in animal products – meat, fish and dairy. (Dairy is important, even if you eat fish and meat, as it makes B12 more “bio-available”.) However, high-meat, low-veg diets can also be a problem. “People on Atkins-type diets restrict the intake of foods that are rich in folate, like fruits, vegetables and wholegrains, and if you are lacking folate, your B12 can’t work properly,” explains Donnai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Low stomach acid&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are on proton pump inhibitors to reduce acid in their stomach – which is 10 per cent of the population – are at risk of B12 deficiency. “It’s a massive cause,” says Mullan. “When you eat a piece of protein, B12 is bound on and you need stomach acid to release it. If you don’t have the acid, it doesn’t happen.” (This is why B12 supplements that are absorbed in the mouth work better when the stomach isn’t doing its job.) Metformin, the medication taken for Type 2 diabetes, can also lead to B12 deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Coeliac disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;B12 deficiency is common in cases of &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/diet/nutrition/hidden-signs-coeliac-disease/"&gt;coeliac disease&lt;/a&gt;, especially when untreated. The damage caused by coeliac disease to the small intestine can prevent the absorption of nutrients. Other conditions that can cause B12 deficiency include &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/01/24/talking-therapy-treatment-bowel-disorders-crohns-disease/"&gt;Crohn’s disease&lt;/a&gt; and chronic pancreatitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin B12 deficiency becomes more common as we age, affecting around one in 10 people aged 75 or over and one in 20 people aged over 65. This is partly because digestion slows down and stomach acid decreases so the capacity to absorb B12 declines too. “Ageing itself requires more energy and more repairing needs to be done and so the need for B12 is higher,” says Donnai. “At the same time, as we age, we tend to eat a less varied diet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Alcohol&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol affects B12 levels in many ways. It decreases stomach acid which we need to release B12 from food, and also irritates the lining of the stomach and intestines, leading to gastritis which also reduces absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-colour"&gt;Pernicious anaemia&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pernicious anaemia is an autoimmune disease which prevents the absorption of B12. When B12 is released from food, it binds on to a transporter called intrinsic factor, which then transports the B12 through the small intestine where it will be absorbed. When someone has pernicious anaemia, the body attacks the cells which produce this intrinsic factor. Without this key transporter, the B12 can’t be transported and utilised. Although the condition can occur at any age, peak occurrence is at 60 years of age and it’s more prevalent in women. Anyone with a confirmed B12 deficiency should also be tested for intrinsic factor antibodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;What foods are highest in B12?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You need to be eating as varied a diet as possible in order to keep your B12 and folate levels up together,” says Nicola Shubrook, a nutritionist with Urban Wellness. “For B12, it’s animal products – meat, fish and dairy. If you’re a vegan, there is fortified nutritional yeast. Folate-rich foods are leafy green vegetables, broccoli, peas, citrus fruits, chickpeas and kidney beans.” Marmite is another vegetarian source of B12, although with a very high salt content. One 8g serving provides 76 per cent of the recommended B12 daily intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The NHS guidelines recommend 1.5mcg of B12 for adults each day,” says Shubrook.&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/29/rfk-jr-body-shames-west-virginia-governor" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;visited West Virginia&lt;/a&gt; on March 28 to promote his “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) agenda at an event where he cruelly criticized state Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s weight. Kennedy suggested that he would host a public weigh-in and celebration once Morrisey had shed 30 pounds, and Kennedy had an idea about how the governor could do it: “We’re going to put him on a carnivore diet,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Weeks before, science journalist and meat enthusiast Nina Teicholz argued in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece titled “&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/meat-will-make-america-healthy-again-federal-guidelines-nutrition-reform-protein-eded2b3e"&gt;Meat Will Make America Healthy Again&lt;/a&gt;” that when the US government updates its dietary guidelines this year, it needs to keep meat firmly at the center of the plate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--block-placement _80slsf2 _80slsf0 duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--highlight _1agbrixl _1lbxzst0"&gt;&lt;p class="_1lbxzst1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="_1lbxzst4"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1 _1lbxzst7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have questions or comments on this newsletter?&lt;/strong&gt; Email us at futureperfect@vox.com!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;“The Trump administration can ensure that federal dietary guidelines recognize the role of high-quality protein in improving Americans’ health,” Teicholz wrote. (In her view, “high-quality protein” comes from animals, while protein from plants is “inferior.”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Meat industry groups, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/HHS-OASH-2024-0017-9142"&gt;National Cattlemen’s Beef Association&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.regulations.gov/comment/HHS-OASH-2024-0017-8961"&gt;National Pork Board&lt;/a&gt;, have made similar pleas. Lucky for them, Kennedy and US Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins — who so far has &lt;a href="https://www.rfdtv.com/ag-sec-brooke-rollins-has-taken-hpai-vaccines-off-the-table"&gt;acted&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="/future-perfect/405972/trump-slaughter-line-speed-poultry-pork"&gt;lockstep&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href="https://nppc.org/news/nppc-congratulates-appreciates-usda-secretary-rollins-commitment-to-fixing-prop-12/"&gt;meat industry&lt;/a&gt; — are in charge of publishing the new federal dietary guidelines, which are updated every five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But the push to get Americans to eat more meat goes against what the government’s own nutrition experts recommend. In December, a government-commissioned expert committee &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/Scientific_Report_of_the_2025_Dietary_Guidelines_Advisory_Committee_508c.pdf"&gt;recommended the federal dietary guidelines be updated&lt;/a&gt; to encourage Americans to eat less red and processed meat and more protein from plant-based sources, like beans and lentils. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And it’s unclear what era of meat supremacy Teicholz means to invoke when she says meat will make America healthy again. Americans are eating more meat — and other animal products — than ever, and it doesn’t seem to be making us any healthier, though, as rates of diet-related diseases like cancer, heart disease, and Type 2 diabetes remain high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Teasing apart cause and effect in nutrition research is notoriously messy and complicated, and our high levels of meat consumption alone can’t explain America’s high rates of chronic disease — other factors, like consumption of highly processed sugary and salty foods, along with rates of exercise, alcohol and tobacco intake, health care access, and exposure to pollution, also determine health outcomes. But study after study has found that high meat consumption can increase our risk of diet-related chronic diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While many Americans might like to hear that our abnormally high levels of meat consumption is actually healthy and virtuous — and that we need to eat even more of it — nutrition research largely shows that we would be better off if we did the very opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="make-america-eat-more-plants" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make America eat more plants &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-023-03093-1"&gt;significant body&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8604150/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; shows that when people &lt;a href="https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-023-00877-2"&gt;eat more healthy plant-based foods&lt;/a&gt;, like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes, they can lower their risk of &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/11/3952"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-023-00877-2"&gt;certain types of cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2738784"&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-023-00877-2"&gt;premature death&lt;/a&gt;.

It has also driven the EAT-Lancet Commission, a large, global committee of nutrition and sustainability experts, to &lt;a href="https://eatforum.org/lancet-commission/eatinghealthyandsustainable/"&gt;advocate for a diet&lt;/a&gt; that would reduce the average American’s consumption of meat by about 75 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;For a time, going in that direction seemed like it might be possible. Americans ate less meat during the Great Recession, even if it was done primarily to save money rather than improve personal health. And through the 2010s, the term “flexitarian” rose to prominence as a &lt;a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2018/consumers-cite-health-concerns-cost-as-reasons-they-eat-less-meat"&gt;significant share&lt;/a&gt; of Americans &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/282779/nearly-one-four-cut-back-eating-meat.aspx"&gt;told pollsters&lt;/a&gt; they were cutting back on meat while the benefits of plant-based eating entered the zeitgeist thanks to celebrities like &lt;a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/review-i-tried-beyonce-22-days-nutrition-vegan-meal-plan-217895"&gt;Beyoncé&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/lizzo-good-as-hell-peta-vegan-video-1235119429/"&gt;Lizzo&lt;/a&gt;. By the early 2020s, the &lt;a href="/2019/5/28/18626859/meatless-meat-explained-vegan-impossible-burger"&gt;hype around new-and-improved plant-based meat and milk products&lt;/a&gt; from startup darlings Beyond Meat, Oatly, and Impossible Foods became inescapable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But this all proved to be more show than substance — American consumption of meat, dairy, and eggs has only increased over the last decade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And the proverbial vibe has shifted from the days of buzzy Impossible burgers and skipping meat on Mondays. The health halo around “plant-based” products has worn thin — in part due to &lt;a href="/future-perfect/391795/ultra-processed-foods-science-vegan-meat-rfk-maha"&gt;flimsy science&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90931204/beyond-impossible-disinformation-mystery-berman"&gt;mass PR campaign&lt;/a&gt; funded by the meat industry — while meat consumption is once again culturally ascendant, as &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/03/meat-boom-trump-rfk-jr/682150/"&gt;The Atlantic’s Yasmin Tayag&lt;/a&gt; captured last week. The signs are everywhere, Tayag notes: declining plant-based meat sales, America’s protein fixation, the rise of the “manosphere,” and the belief of some of its loudest voices that masculinity requires eating lots of meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Messages of moderation in the annals of American nutrition research appear to be no match against the &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/02/is-an-all-meat-diet-what-nature-intended"&gt;popularity of carnivore diet devotees&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.grubstreet.com/article/high-protein-diet-food-grocery-stores.html"&gt;protein maxxing&lt;/a&gt;, and MAHA-aligned health influencers who rail against cooking with seed oils while praising butter and beef tallow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;After decades of government hesitance to confront the roots of America’s biggest diet-related health crises, Kennedy and the MAHA coalition’s promises to challenge large food companies and address chronic disease head-on is refreshing. But its prescription is more vibes and anecdotes than evidence. The MAHA coalition doesn’t appear to ever question our high levels of animal product consumption, for example, but rather wants to increase it, and in supposedly “natural” forms: &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2025/02/04/raw-milk-mom-influencers-rfk-jr-dangers-bird-flu/78019020007/"&gt;raw milk&lt;/a&gt; over nondairy milk, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/mar/29/rfk-jr-says-they-are-poisoning-us-influencers-call-them-unnatural-but-what-is-the-truth-about-seed-oils"&gt;butter and beef tallow&lt;/a&gt; over seed oils, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo7ZgOAQyJ0"&gt;grass-fed beef&lt;/a&gt; over feedlot beef.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In this way, many MAHA supporters fall prey to the same fallacy of many liberal food reformers: the belief that &lt;a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/193307/nature-solutionism-vaccines-beef-climate"&gt;only what is “natural” is good&lt;/a&gt;. But milk is now pasteurized because raw milk can make people terribly sick, plant-based seed oils are likely healthier than butter, and grass-fed beef is &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2025/03/17/grass-fed-beef-health-emissions/"&gt;worse for the planet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/is-grass-fed-beef-really-better-for-you-the-animal-and-the-planet/2015/02/23/92733524-b6d1-11e4-9423-f3d0a1ec335c_story.html"&gt;hardly better&lt;/a&gt; for you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;While beans and lentils are less protein-dense than meat — and are less easily digested, as Teicholz rightly points out in her op-ed, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/10/31/animal-plant-protein-absorption-digestion/"&gt;if only slightly&lt;/a&gt; — they’re also free of cholesterol, extremely low in saturated fat, and loaded with fiber, which, unlike protein, more than &lt;a href="https://nutrition.org/most-americans-are-not-getting-enough-fiber-in-our-diets/"&gt;90 percent&lt;/a&gt; of Americans are deficient in. (And they’re still a great source of protein.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Calls to make America healthy again by eating more meat than ever may be politically popular — who doesn’t want to feel empowered to do something that for so long people have been made to feel bad about? But there is a cost to this collective dismissal of nutrition and public health research: &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.26.23300536v1"&gt;Some research&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1523119113"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt; that countries would save on health care costs if their citizens ate more plant-rich diets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;If the Trump administration is sincere about cost cutting, and RFK Jr. is sincere about making America healthier, they both ought to take that advice to heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vox</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 16:45:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxPXzF1TW9yZXBLM0xGbzllbWgzREdZT3BqakNDblIwRU9IdTNXUE82WHRMY3RqQkU0Q3FUMFN0UmNjYlZrQ1pDZG11RmpNam05a2xOMWJ1cnA4aHhwRE44VHVEZy1hTmk2aU5abFVjaEpDY3A2dzMtVmxDQW1oRVpaQkJaa3Z2dEE</guid></item><item><title>Cardiologists have announced THIS vegetable as #1 for heart health - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi6AFBVV95cUxNOEZIS1lPUm5ZcHU1LVZoVEg5S3NYdThwaE5GOTBmQXg1RkRQSjR5aVdPT2pyRUYtMnJlNS11M3U3bE9ROE1RTE12Vm5oOHB1M2dFVXVjVmJVVk03MF81SGNxMzRpRDhGRUlVWXJwUk1FRG42cDdIVWQzWVU1V3BGNDZXRlRXMkhSVWhiX3V1LUU2UDdzVXVzZ1pkZ3Z0RmtIaW1ZSVp2b0JqWTBPRXl3eXpfVWNTNUZUTi1YbDlSclVNVVFoUS0wS2FJMWJyemdKdDMtaFhyV2dGLTVwajQ5cWtFakJLc2F6?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, no one would be surprised to find that vegetables are one of the most recommended objects of consumption for good heart health. According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, with an estimated 17.9 million deaths each year. Most of these deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and their leading reasons are unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and addiction to tobacco and alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most cardiologists prescribe a healthy diet filled with fruits and vegetables for a healthy heart. However, now the cardiologists have lifted the veil from the #1 vegetable that you should eat to have a healthy and happy heart. And that vegetable is (cue the drum sounds) Brussels sprouts!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These cabbage-like veggies are so beneficial for your heart that Carl Lavie Jr, M.D., FACC, medical director of Cardiac Rehabilitation and Prevention at Ochsner Health, said that they’re one of his top choices for heart health, as “It’s one many do not consider!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brussels sprouts are rich in fibre&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fibre is one important nutrient that many of us don’t get enough of, and brussels sprouts are filled with them. A cup of these vegetables contains 6 gms of fibre, which can help you get the recommended 25-38 gms of the nutrient you need each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11906-022-01216-2" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, fibre-rich diets can lead to alterations in the gut bacteria that help in decreasing the blood pressure. The gut microbes consume the fibre to produce beneficial compounds called short-chain fatty acids, which improve heart health by reducing blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brussels Sprouts are rich in Vitamin K&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin that helps the blood clot and maintains bone strength. It is mostly found in the green leafy veggies, but brussels sprouts are the best vegetable choice if you want to increase your vitamin K intake. One cup of cooked brussels sprouts provides two-and-a-half times the vitamin K you need in a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mgid_country_osv_parent"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that vitamin K can interact with some medications, such as blood thinners, so in case you are taking medication for the same, consult your doctor before increasing your intake of veggies rich in this vitamin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brussels Sprouts are rich in Nitrates&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

They are a debatable topic in the nutrition field; however, as per &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-024-03577-8" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, natural nitrates found in vegetables such as brussels sprouts can be healthy for the heart. When nitrates enter the body, it converts them into nitric oxide, which helps expand the blood vessels. Thus, blood inside the body is able to flow freely, improving circulation and decreasing pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brussels sprouts are rich in Vitamin C&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cup of cooked brussels sprouts can provide the consumer a day’s worth of vitamin C. This vitamin fights the free radicals in the body that target the heart and lead to conditions such as atherosclerosis, wherein a plaque composed of fat, cholesterol and other substances forms in the artery walls, leading to their narrowing and then potentially blocking the blood flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brussels sprouts are rich in Potassium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many of us overlook the consumption of potassium in our diet, this nutrient is also good for the heart. A cup of cooked brussels sprouts has roughly 10% of the daily value of potassium. Thus, consuming these veggies will help in regulating your blood pressure by countering the impact of sodium, which most of us consume a lot of. Additionally, as per the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/salt/sodium-potassium-health/index.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, it also protects the body from heart diseases and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you may have been overlooking the purchase of brussels sprouts in your weekly grocery shopping and consuming them in your daily diet, their advantages must serve as an eye-opener for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 16:34:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi6AFBVV95cUxNOEZIS1lPUm5ZcHU1LVZoVEg5S3NYdThwaE5GOTBmQXg1RkRQSjR5aVdPT2pyRUYtMnJlNS11M3U3bE9ROE1RTE12Vm5oOHB1M2dFVXVjVmJVVk03MF81SGNxMzRpRDhGRUlVWXJwUk1FRG42cDdIVWQzWVU1V3BGNDZXRlRXMkhSVWhiX3V1LUU2UDdzVXVzZ1pkZ3Z0RmtIaW1ZSVp2b0JqWTBPRXl3eXpfVWNTNUZUTi1YbDlSclVNVVFoUS0wS2FJMWJyemdKdDMtaFhyV2dGLTVwajQ5cWtFakJLc2F6</guid></item><item><title>Do You Need a Measles Booster Shot?

              &lt;p&gt;Measles has been making an unwelcome comeback in the &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/eye-popping-who-report-shows-measles-surging-across-the-globe-2000576089"&gt;U.S. and world&lt;/a&gt; lately. Its resurgence might be enough to make many of us reasonably wonder: Just how protected am I from measles? And should I think about getting a booster vaccine shot?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s important to emphasize that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine is highly effective—providing 97% protection from measles with the standard two-shot series. Most Americans have and are still getting vaccinated with the MMR vaccine, thanks to routine childhood programs that were established nationwide &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4388794/#:~:text=In%201969%2C%20only%2017%20states%20had%20school%20laws%20that%20included%20measles%3B%20by%201980%2C%20all%2050%20states%20had%20them."&gt;starting in the 1980s.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These programs require children to receive several vaccines to attend public school, but families can obtain medical or personal exemptions depending on the state. As of the 2023-2024 school year, roughly 93% of school-age children in the U.S. have &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#cdc_data_surveillance_section_7-mmr-vaccine-coverage-for-kindergarteners-by-school-year-2009%e2%80%932024:~:text=However%2C%20vaccination%20coverage%20among%20U.S.%20kindergartners%20has%20decreased%20from%2095.2%25%20during%20the%202019%E2%80%932020%20school%20year%20to%2092.7%25%20in%20the%202023%E2%80%932024%20school%20year%2C%20leaving%20approximately%20280%2C000%20kindergartners%20at%20risk%20during%20the%202023%E2%80%932024%20school%20year.%20To%20dive%20into%20vaccine%20coverage%20data%20for%20MMR%2C%20visit%20VaxView."&gt;received&lt;/a&gt; their MMR shots. That said, this percentage has slightly dipped in recent years and is now below the threshold of herd, or community, immunity needed to prevent the highly contagious virus from spreading widely in any given area. Hence the recent outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-measles-outbreaks-arent-going-away-soon-cdc-warns-2000575136"&gt;current measles outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; in Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma, &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/childhood-vaccines/new-cases-push-us-measles-total-past-500"&gt;now officially over 500 cases&lt;/a&gt;, are occurring almost entirely among pockets of unvaccinated people, and it’s the unvaccinated who are much more vulnerable to measles, particularly very young children. But there are certain situations in which you might want or need a catch-up vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Walter Orenstein, a professor at the &lt;span class="il"&gt;Emory&lt;/span&gt; University School of Medicine and former director of the U.S. immunization program at CDC, notes that there were two types of measles vaccine that first became available in the U.S. in 1963.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One was a live, weakened virus vaccine—the same type used today, though later modified to be milder—and the other was an inactivated, or killed, measles virus vaccine. Unfortunately, the inactivated vaccine didn’t provide lasting immunity and increased the risk of a severe form of measles, known as &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/336928"&gt;atypical measles&lt;/a&gt;, in people who later caught the virus naturally. It was pulled by 1967—but some people who got it are still around today.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“So if someone was vaccinated between 1963 and 1967 with this vaccine, or an unknown vaccine, it’s reasonable to get another dose of the measles vaccine that’s actually effective,” Orenstein told Gizmodo. People who received this vaccine or are unsure of which vaccine they received during this time period are recommended to get at least one dose of the standard measles vaccine.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Practically everyone born before 1957 is likely to have contracted measles, which also provides long-lasting immunity, so they’re generally fine. The Centers for Disease Control has said that healthcare personnel born before 1957 with no evidence of measles infection (either in their records or from lab tests) &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fvpd%2Fmmr%2Fpublic%2Findex.html#:~:text=Healthcare%20personnel%20born%20before%201957%20without%20laboratory%20evidence%20of%20immunity%20or%20disease%20should%20consider%20getting%202%20doses%20of%20MMR%20vaccine."&gt;should consider&lt;/a&gt; the standard two-dose series.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that Americans born between 1968 and 1989 received only one shot of the MMR vaccine. Even a single shot is highly effective—about 93%—so most people in this scenario are well protected. But the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/questions.html#:~:text=If%20you%20were,a%20measles%20outbreak"&gt;does recommend&lt;/a&gt; that adults at higher risk for measles exposure get their second shot if they haven’t already. These higher-risk groups include college students, healthcare personnel, people traveling internationally, and anyone else who’s deemed to be at risk by public health officials, such as people living near active outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The nearly 100% protection provided by full MMR vaccination does still leave open some tiny room for vulnerability, of course. Sometimes, a fully vaccinated person, exposed to measles during an outbreak, will get sick. This might happen because the person’s immune system didn’t mount a full protective response at the time of vaccination, or because a person’s immunity has waned over time.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Thankfully, waning immunity isn’t a major individual concern. Studies have estimated that somewhere between &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X23009507"&gt;0.22%&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(24)00181-6/fulltext"&gt;0.04%&lt;/a&gt; of the vaccine’s effectiveness declines yearly. This means it would take between five and 25 years for the average person to be 1% less protected than they were right after their MMR shots.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are concerned about your susceptibility to measles, or you don’t know your vaccination status, you can always talk to your primary care doctor. Your doctor might run a blood test to check for measles antibodies—or even proactively recommend an MMR dose. While no one likes a needle, the MMR vaccine is perfectly safe, so getting an extra shot is fine even if you might already be well-protected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“One of the pluses, if someone happens to be already immune, is that nothing would happen because their bodies would kill the vaccine virus before anything can happen,” Orenstein said.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Outside of a few corner situations, though, measles remains a more serious threat to the unvaccinated, including people who are too young or medically unable to get vaccinated, such as people with severely weakened immune systems. The best way to keep the virus contained, he notes, is to make sure everyone who can get vaccinated does.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“That’s why it’s so critical that we get very high immunization levels in our communities. Because for the measles virus to survive, it needs to be transmitted from an infectious person to a susceptible person. And if the infectious person only comes in contact with immune people, that chain of transmission is broken and indirectly protects people who can’t be vaccinated because they have legitimate medical contradictions—they’re all protected if they’re not exposed,” Orenstein said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Children are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; to get their first MMR shot between 12 and 15 months of age, and their second shot between 4 and 6 years of age, though children at risk of exposure &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/kids-health/measles-vaccine-can-young-children-get-early-dose-mmr-shot-rcna198038"&gt;during an outbreak or international travel&lt;/a&gt; may receive them earlier and/or an extra dose.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Measles is no joke—it’s highly contagious and can be dangerous especially for kids and people who can’t get vaccinated.

&lt;p&gt;I once stood within the halls of academia, benefiting from the generous funding of the &lt;a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/tag/National-Institutes-of-Health"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;. I was part of the system, a researcher fueled by grants that were supposed to propel scientific progress.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But after years inside the machine, I have come to a sobering conclusion: &lt;a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2025/03/11/trumps-pick-head-nih-did-not-follow-covid-herd/"&gt;The NIH&lt;/a&gt; is fundamentally broken and morally corrupted. Corruption, waste, and fraud are not occasional lapses but systemic failures. The agency must be gutted and reformed if we are to salvage scientific integrity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the most damning indictments against &lt;a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2023/05/09/exclusive-republicans-demand-answers-nih-transgender-youth-experiments-study-left-2-dead-others-sterilized/"&gt;the NIH&lt;/a&gt; is the reproducibility crisis. Science is supposed to be built on verifiable, repeatable results, yet the vast majority of research funded by the NIH fails this basic test.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A widely cited survey in the journal Nature found that a staggering 70% of scientists surveyed reported failing to reproduce published research. Worse still, in a landmark study by Dr. Glenn Begley, only 11% of oncology studies that were reviewed could be replicated—meaning that 89% of these supposedly groundbreaking cancer studies were essentially worthless.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While these statistics are of studies in general and not just of those funded by the NIH, this shows that many in the scientific community, including many of those funded by the NIH, are working with potentially unreliable data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This crisis is not just a theoretical concern; it has real-world consequences. False leads misdirect entire fields, wasting billions of taxpayer dollars and delaying real medical breakthroughs. And yet, despite these revelations, the NIH continues to funnel money into the same broken system without demanding accountability or reform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem extends beyond faulty studies—it is exacerbated by the complicity of major academic journals. If a study aligns with a prevailing political narrative, it often gets published regardless of scientific rigor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nowhere was this clearer than in the handling &lt;a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2023/09/01/covid-19-origins-a-steady-drip-of-intriguing-revelations/"&gt;of COVID-19’s&lt;/a&gt; origins. Prestigious journals like Science and Nature Medicine published papers that promoted the politically convenient theory that the virus originated from a wet market, despite glaring holes in the data. Subsequent email leaks revealed that former NIH Director Francis Collins and Anthony Fauci actively pushed this misleading narrative.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This was not an accident. These journals, reliant on grants and government ties, have abandoned scientific objectivity. They do not face consequences for publishing fraudulent research. When a study is eventually debunked, at most, a quiet retraction is issued—long after the damage has been done. Even today, these journals refuse to retract the faulty &lt;a href="https://www.dailysignal.com/2024/05/23/in-covid-19-oversight-house-republicans-deliver-a-win-for-accountability/"&gt;COVID-19 origin&lt;/a&gt; studies, underscoring their unwillingness to prioritize truth over ideology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond the issue of fraudulent studies, the NIH’s grant distribution system is a financial disaster. I saw firsthand how NIH grants—often exceeding a million dollars each—are handed out to principal investigators who have no training in financial or personnel management.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These researchers, brilliant in their fields but clueless in budgeting, routinely squander taxpayer money. Lab managers (often research assistants with no financial expertise) oversee massive budgets with little to no oversight. The result? Expensive lab equipment gathering dust, unnecessary purchases of antibodies and reagents, and a total lack of accountability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s worse, principal investigators often manipulate the system to justify continued funding. One of the most common fraudulent tactics is using old data—research conducted before receiving the grant—to fabricate progress. Since there is virtually no oversight from the NIH on how grant money is actually spent, this deceit is easy to execute and nearly impossible to detect. It is a free-for-all with taxpayer money, and there is no mechanism in place to hold bad actors accountable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even when fraud is exposed, punishment is nonexistent. Universities and researchers caught red-handed in scientific misconduct face no real repercussions. Journals simply issue retractions, and the guilty parties move on to prestigious positions elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consider the scandal at Duke University, where researchers were caught in 2018 engaging in massive scientific fraud, allegedly submitting falsified research data to keep and win multimillion-dollar research grants from the NIH and the Environmental Protection Agency. While Duke paid the federal government $112.5 million to settle the case, instead of severe consequences, those involved simply moved on. One of the key figures even landed in a leadership role at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another example is the fraudulent Alzheimer’s research that misled the entire field for years. Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, President Donald Trump’s nominee for NIH director, recently highlighted during his confirmation hearing how a series of falsified studies led to a cascade of misleading research that set back Alzheimer’s treatment by decades. Hundreds of studies, all built on a foundation of lies, consumed untold amounts of funding and diverted resources away from legitimate research. Yet, those responsible faced little more than a tarnished reputation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, what’s the solution?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NIH, as it stands today, is beyond reform. It is not simply suffering from mismanagement; it is an institution riddled with systemic corruption. The solution is drastic but necessary: The NIH must be gutted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Funding should be stripped from ineffective programs, and a new oversight mechanism must be established to ensure transparency and accountability. Grants should no longer be handed out to researchers with no financial acumen. Journals that publish fraudulent research should face consequences beyond a mere retraction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, the scientific community must reclaim its integrity. If research cannot be replicated, it should not be funded. If fraud is uncovered, there must be real consequences. The American people deserve better than a corrupt, self-serving bureaucracy that prioritizes its own survival over genuine scientific advancement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I once believed in the NIH. I sure did. I still believe in the power of research to change lives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But after seeing the corruption, waste, and deceit firsthand, I can no longer stay silent. The NIH is not the solution to our scientific woes—it is the problem. Until it is torn down and rebuilt with accountability and merit at its core, science will continue to fail the very people it claims to serve.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although a plethora of medications and therapies now exist for major depression, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-10-transcranial-current-home-significant-reductions.html"&gt;roughly one in three&lt;/a&gt; diagnosed patients still suffer from treatment-resistant depression (TRD)—a form of the disorder that does not respond to first-line antidepressants. Even when traditional drugs work, they often take weeks to kick in, delaying relief for people in crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;In response to this need, scientists have recently begun investigating whether fast-acting substances with different neurological effects could serve as alternative antidepressants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Encouraged by &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-023-01629-w" target="_blank"&gt;initial successes with ketamine&lt;/a&gt;, researchers including Peter Nagele, MD, Professor of Anesthesia and Critical Care and Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience at the University of Chicago, turned to another anesthetic: &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/nitrous+oxide/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;nitrous oxide&lt;/a&gt;, better known as "laughing gas."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early clinical studies showed promise, so Nagele and his collaborators wanted to understand more about what exactly happens inside the brain during and after laughing gas treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a study published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-57951-y" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they pinpoint a novel neurological mechanism that helps explain how a gas that exits the body in minutes can trigger lasting improvements in mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Figuring out how the observed antidepressant effects work at a neural and molecular level is an important step toward clinical acceptance and implementation," said Nagele, the senior author of the new paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A new use for a familiar anesthetic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people associate laughing gas with dentists' offices, where it's used to ease anxiety and dull pain. While its nickname hints at euphoric effects, at the low doses used for depression research, it acts as a sedative, giving people a temporary feeling of calm rather than making them feel giddy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Nitrous oxide is the oldest anesthetic we've got—it's been used worldwide for over 180 years, costs about $20 a tank, and yet we're still learning what it can do," said first author Joseph Cichon, MD, Ph.D., an assistant professor of Anesthesiology and Critical Care at the University of Pennsylvania. "I felt like Indiana Jones, going back in time to crack the mystery of this ancient drug."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2021-06-doses-gas-fast-effective-treatment.html"&gt;preliminary clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; led by Nagele and researchers at Washington University in St. Louis, even a single inhalation session could bring positive change to patients who hadn't responded to other treatments, with effects lasting up to two weeks in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The results were striking," Nagele said. "We saw people who had been struggling for years experience meaningful improvement within hours that lasted for weeks. It made us wonder what, exactly, was happening in the brain to cause this."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;Defying expectations about brain activity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years, scientists assumed the antidepressant effects of both nitrous oxide and ketamine were tied to the drugs' ability to block specific proteins on brain cells involved in memory and learning: N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while this theory was widely accepted, it had never been fully tested in living brain circuits. More importantly, it didn't fully explain why nitrous oxide, which leaves the body very quickly, could produce lasting effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate, the researchers from UChicago, UPenn and WashU used advanced calcium imaging to observe &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/brain+activity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;brain activity&lt;/a&gt; in mice that inhaled nitrous oxide after being exposed to chronic stress—a common model for depression. Looking at the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cingulate+cortex/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cingulate cortex&lt;/a&gt;, a brain region associated with emotional regulation and mood, they zeroed in on a specific group of neurons known as layer V (L5) &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/pyramidal+neurons/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;pyramidal neurons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Particularly in stress-related depression, we usually see that these L5 neurons are underactive in both mice and humans," Nagele said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the experimental mice, however, the researchers saw that nitrous oxide quickly and selectively activated L5 neurons, pulling them out of their state of stress-induced inactivity even after the gas left mice's bodies. The previously-stressed mice almost immediately perked up and started doing more enjoyable activities like sipping sugar water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This 'disinhibition' effect'—where the brain becomes less suppressed and more engaged—looks to be a crucial reason for the drug's antidepressant benefits," Nagele explained. "It helps reactivate &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neural+circuits/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neural circuits&lt;/a&gt; dulled by stress and depression without needing to form entirely new brain connections."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key turned out to be specialized &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/potassium+channels/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;potassium channels&lt;/a&gt; found in L5 neurons, called SK2 channels. Under normal conditions, these channels help shut down neuron activity, but nitrous oxide blocks the SK2 channels, preventing them from silencing the L5 cells. As a result, the neurons remain active and the surrounding brain circuit shifts into a more excitable, energized state.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;h2&gt;Steps toward a new generation of depression treatments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These results show us there might be more than one path to the desired outcome in depression treatment," Nagele said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"NMDA receptors matter, but what we're seeing with nitrous oxide suggests there's another way to spark the brain's circuitry back into action. It's an exciting discovery because it widens our understanding of how we can tackle depression from multiple angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers caution that while the findings are promising, more studies are needed to understand how long the neurological effects of laughing gas last and whether they contribute to deeper, more permanent recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this fresh understanding of how fast-acting antidepressants might work—without relying solely on NMDA-receptor mechanisms—opens the door to future drug development. For example, rather than relying on an inhaled gas that must be clinically administered, scientists might one day design oral medications that mimic this mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This study brings us one step closer to understanding how nitrous oxide can help patients who haven't responded to anything else," Nagele said. "If we can isolate the exact pathways involved, we could create new depression treatments that are more accessible and longer-lasting."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So residents of Wales born on either side of the dividing date were matched according to their use of preventative health services, past diagnoses, and educational level. The incidence of dementia was then compared between people on either side of September 2, 1933. As a first step, the researchers confirmed that the vaccine was effective at reducing the incidence of shingles, with numbers similar to those in the vaccine's clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, being eligible for the vaccine was associated with a 1.3 percent reduction in the absolute risk of a dementia diagnosis. That translates to a 8.5 percent reduction of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_risk"&gt;relative risk&lt;/a&gt;; when scaled to account for the fact that fewer than half of those eligible received the vaccine, that works out to be a 20 percent reduction in relative risk, which is pretty substantial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make sure that it was real, the researchers repeated the analysis using a difference-in-difference approach and came up with roughly the same numbers. That also eliminates the possibility that people who came in for health care (for shingles or some other condition) were more likely to incidentally receive a dementia diagnosis. They also compared the before-and-after populations in terms of a collection of common health outcomes and found that none of those showed any change in the two populations. And nothing else related to NHS policy was changed based on the September 2 date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, in &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.08.23295225v1"&gt;a draft manuscript&lt;/a&gt; the researchers posted on the Med arXiv, the researchers find a similar effect when using UK HNS data to search for a protective effect of the shingles vaccines when it comes to deaths diagnosed to result from dementia. So by all indications, the effect was real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s going on?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest three potential explanations. One of them is the obvious: Suppressing the reactivation of the varicella zoster virus reduces dementia onset. But it's also possible that the effect is indirect—that dementia is associated with immune activity, and the vaccine alters that in some way. Finally, there's the possibility that being treated for shingles could promote the onset of dementia or increase the frequency of diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;

          
                  &lt;/div&gt;

If you have a &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-meal-kit-delivery-service/" target="_self"&gt;balanced diet&lt;/a&gt;, chances are you're already getting enough nutrients, but that can change as we age. Older people are at an increased risk for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2682456/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;low vitamin consumption&lt;/a&gt; -- partly because our bodies can no longer effectively absorb certain nutrients. So, if you're dealing with deficiencies, are on specific medications or have particular health conditions, your doctor may advise you to take certain supplements to make sure your body has all the nutrients it needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="u-speakableText-p2"&gt;These are the top six vitamins and minerals that doctors recommend you focus on for healthy aging. Just be sure to talk to your doctor first before adjusting your diet or trying new supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Magnesium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnesium is a mineral that provides several key functions in the body. It keeps your muscles strong, regulates blood sugar levels and contributes to heart health. &lt;a href="https://www.vitality101.com/about-dr-teitelbaum" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Dr. Jacob Teitelbaum&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified internist in integrative medicine, told us that "magnesium is critical for well over 300 reactions in the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said an unprocessed diet has about 600 mg of magnesium daily, but the average American diet has less than 250 mg of magnesium after processing. For reference, the daily recommended amount of magnesium is &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/are-you-getting-enough-magnesium" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;400 to 420 mg per day for adult men&lt;/a&gt; and 310 to 320 mg for women, but more is needed for those who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-all-top spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teitelbaum warned that the effects of low magnesium may include an &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/circulationaha.105.588327" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increased risk of metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. This can lead to heart attacks, strokes and dementia. You may also feel exhausted or experience widespread muscle pain if you're not getting enough magnesium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find magnesium in a wide range of ingredients. &lt;a href="https://fatlotofgood.com.au/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Dr. Peter Brukner&lt;/a&gt;, a specialist sports and exercise physician, said you can find magnesium in nuts, seeds, whole grains and leafy green vegetables like spinach. In extra yummy news, you can also get magnesium from dark chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some older adults or those who take specific medicines (such as diuretics or drugs for acid reflux) may not receive enough magnesium from their diet and might need &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/5-best-magnesium-supplements/" target="_self"&gt;a supplement&lt;/a&gt;," he said. "However, too much magnesium can cause stomach issues, so be careful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. B vitamins&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Laurie Ambrose/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You also need a range of B Vitamins, including B12 and folate (also called folic acid), to maintain your health as you age. Vitamin B-12 works with folate to help your body make new cells, including blood cells and nerve cells. While you don't usually require more B12 as you age, your &lt;a href="https://aging.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Nutrition-Needs_Vitamin-B12_FINAL-2.18.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;body cannot absorb it as well&lt;/a&gt; when you get older. Brukner said this is because "stomachs make less acid, and this acid is necessary to take the vitamin from food into the body."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teitelbaum said B vitamins are critical for energy production, and suboptimal levels can affect your health. He warns that B vitamin deficiency has been associated with "a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8079632/#s5" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;marked increase of dementia&lt;/a&gt; (especially folic acid) and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749379715000732" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increased risk of heart attack and stroke&lt;/a&gt; (especially in those with elevated homocysteine levels)." Symptoms of B12 deficiency include weakness or poor balance, loss of appetite and numbness and tingling in the hands and feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B12 is found in animal proteins like meat, fish and eggs. Brukner said that if you don't eat these foods, you may want to turn to foods like cereals and nutritional yeast with added B12. "Older people, especially those having certain stomach issues or taking medicine that lowers stomach acid, might need to take a B12 vitamin supplement," he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amelia-ti/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Amelia Ti&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian and diabetes educator in New York, who is also part of &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/how-we-ensure-accurate-and-reliable-medical-information/" target="_self"&gt;CNET's Medical Review Board&lt;/a&gt;, adds that people taking medicine that blocks B12 absorption, like omeprazole or metformin, may also need a vitamin B12 supplement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Calcium&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Institute on Aging says that calcium is especially important for &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/vitamins-and-supplements/vitamins-and-minerals-older-adults#calcium" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;older people at risk for bone loss&lt;/a&gt;. The Institute recommends 1,000 mg each day for men between the ages of 51 and 70, and 1,200 mg per day for men 71 and older. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/best-vitamins-for-women-50-plus/" target="_self"&gt;Women aged 51 and up&lt;/a&gt; are recommended to take 1,200 mg each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Calcium is well-known for making bones strong, but it is also crucial for muscles to work right," Brukner said. "As people become older, their bodies take in less calcium from food, which can cause bones to become weaker." You can get calcium naturally from sources like milk, yogurt and cheese. The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health notes that &lt;a href="https://nutritionsource.hsph.harvard.edu/calcium/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;calcium is also available&lt;/a&gt; in kale, salmon, tofu, almonds and spinach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for supplements, Brukner said, "If you are at risk for bone troubles or don't get enough calcium in your food, taking supplements might be useful. But too much calcium can cause other issues like kidney stones, so talk with your doctor first."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Vitamin D&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-large"&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt; &lt;span class="c-shortcodeImage_credit g-inner-spacing-right-small g-outer-spacing-top-xsmall g-color-text-meta g-text-xxxsmall"&gt;Malorny/Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D is often called the sunshine vitamin because you typically absorb it through the skin just by being outside. However, during winter months, if you live in a cloudy climate or avoid natural sunlight as you age, you may not get enough. Your body &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/vitamin-d-supplements-explained-who-should-take-them/" target="_self"&gt;needs vitamin D to properly absorb calcium&lt;/a&gt;, making it an important nutrient for bone health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brukner says that in addition to sunshine, you can get vitamin D from fatty fish like salmon and mackerel, fortified milk and cereals. Your doctor may also recommend a supplement if you're experiencing bone loss or at risk of osteoporosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to bone health, Teitelbaum said vitamin D can help you fight off disease. He said, "Suboptimal vitamin D is associated with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6047889/#S8" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increased autoimmunity,&lt;/a&gt; higher risk of severe infectious diseases (&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/supplements-white-house-advisor-fauci-takes-every-day-to-help-keep-his-immune-system-healthy.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;Dr. Fauci noted that he took vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; during the COVID pandemic) and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3440651/#:~:text=Vitamin%20D%20deficiency%20has%20been,it%20a%20potential%20risk%20factor." rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;increased cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Omega-3s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids are essential to many of your body's functions. They play a role in both heart and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/multivitamins-memory-and-aging-everything-to-know/" target="_self"&gt;brain health&lt;/a&gt;. However, as Cleveland Clinic points out, your body &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/17290-omega-3-fatty-acids" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;isn't able to produce enough omega-3s on its own&lt;/a&gt;. This means you need to get more from &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/nutrition/reap-the-benefits-of-omega-3s-with-these-heart-healthy-foods/" target="_self"&gt;the foods you eat&lt;/a&gt; or supplements you take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Omega-3 fatty acids are very good for heart health and can help lessen swelling, which is important for older people," Brukner explained. "They are also beneficial for brain well-being and might help guard against memory loss and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4019002/#:~:text=More%20than%20a%20dozen%20epidemiological,as%20Alzheimer's%20disease%20(AD)." rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;diseases such as Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt;." Ti adds that omega-3s help lessen swelling by reducing inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatty fish like salmon are a good source of omega-3 fatty acids. Brukner said you can also turn to flaxseeds, chia seeds and walnuts but added a warning: "These give a different type of omega-3 that the body does not use so easily." Fish oil and algae oil can also serve as supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Zinc&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/pba.v5.25592" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)" class="c-regularLink"&gt;2015 paper&lt;/a&gt;, published in Pathobiology of Aging and Age-related Diseases, calls zinc an "essential micronutrient for human health in general, and particularly for the elderly." The authors say zinc plays "an important role in the aging process" and that zinc deficiency may be connected to several age-related chronic illnesses, which include hardening of the arteries, degenerative diseases of the nervous system, age-related changes to the immune system and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement" class="c-adDisplay_container c-pageArticle_ad c-pageArticle_ad-90 g-outer-spacing-bottom-medium c-adDisplay_container_incontent-ad-plus-billboard-middle spaced blank"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="c-shortcodeImage u-clearfix c-shortcodeImage-small c-shortcodeImage-pullRight"&gt;&lt;a rel href="https://www.cnet.com/health-tips/" target="_blank" class="c-shortcodeImage_imageContainer"&gt;   &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we get older, our immune system becomes weaker, and if we don't have enough zinc, this can make it even worse," Brukner explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find zinc in shellfish, red meat, poultry, beans, nuts and seeds. Brukner said oysters are particularly zinc-rich. He added, "Some older people might find zinc supplements helpful, especially if they often get sick or do not eat enough foods high in zinc. But taking too much zinc can cause problems with other minerals in the body, so it's important to follow advised amounts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-ad-callout="Advertisement"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating well can help boost your bones, immune system and more as you age. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/pumping-iron-is-key-for-healthy-aging-heres-how-to-start/" target="_self"&gt;Along with exercise&lt;/a&gt; and other good habits, getting the right minerals and vitamins may improve your health. Try to get enough magnesium, B vitamins, calcium, vitamin D, omega-3s and zinc in your diet each day. Talk to your doctor before you take any supplements to find out how they may interact with your existing medications and health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>CNET</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 14:24:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxQQkhHYlJZNmo3Q2xqdVVvMXRtTEdyVG1mQTdaa1c1Mm5Td2RHRFcwOVU3OFh2WWJoLUhsYk15RzJFQnlYYlNxdlNFVmZLZllUNlIwQ1RRQTNFeHBoVGx0OWVWN1REcG01VThUNVotcFByTW1XMFhwakJqT0xnejE0NHpuSnV0TE1nS2JTZmxWaVpVSGJveFAtVG41emsycDFOc0tIYkRUYw</guid></item><item><title>‘World’s smallest pacemaker’ is implanted with a syringe and dissolves when it’s no longer needed - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxPRFdJT2VWX3RoTC11NWpOaWVkYnEyTTc5ZlJQMHpMbkhORGJTekVYUWFJUFpJMEdTQUNZZXo3ZTFoUjBpaV9rVjdmOFlvZm05bXJickRRS01oQ0w0UXQteGxWWDVvU0YtVTRKcktTaHdTTzRaamc5YjdjMnZvNHRQUXNmaWdBb3FlTGl0dmd3R0NKeER6R2c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;The world’s tiniest pacemaker — smaller than a grain of rice — could help save babies born with heart defects, say scientists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The miniature device can be inserted with a syringe and dissolves after it’s no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although it can work with hearts of all sizes, the engineers who created it at &lt;a href="https://news.feinberg.northwestern.edu/2025/04/02/worlds-smallest-pacemaker-is-activated-by-light/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Northwestern University&lt;/a&gt; say it is particularly well-suited to the tiny, fragile hearts of new-born babies with congenital heart defects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Scientists at Northwestern have invented the “world’s smallest pacemaker,” tinier than a grain of rice. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;JohnARogers/NorthwesternUni/SWNS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It measures just 1.8 millimeters in width, 3.5 millimeters in length and one millimeter in thickness, but it still delivers as much stimulation as a full-sized pacemaker.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tiny pacemaker is paired with a small, soft, flexible, wireless, wearable device that mounts onto a patient’s chest to control pacing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the wearable device detects an irregular heartbeat, it automatically shines a light pulse to activate the pacemaker.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The short pulses — which penetrate through the patient’s skin, breastbone and muscles — control the pacing.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;Designed for patients who only need temporary pacing, the pacemaker simply dissolves after it’s no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team of engineers from Northwestern explained that the pacemaker’s components are biocompatible, so they naturally dissolve into the body’s biofluids, bypassing the need for surgical extraction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08726-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; shows the device’s efficiency across several large and small animal models as well as human hearts from deceased organ donors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We have developed what is, to our knowledge, the world’s smallest pacemaker,” Northwestern bioelectronics pioneer Professor John Rogers, who led the development project, said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“There’s a crucial need for temporary pacemakers in the context of pediatric heart surgeries, and that’s a use case where size miniaturization is incredibly important. In terms of the device load on the body — the smaller, the better.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;It’s activated by light and dissolves when it is no longer needed. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;JohnARogers/NorthwesternUni/SWNS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Northwestern experimental cardiologist Professor Igor Efimov, who co-led the study, said their “major motivation” was children.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“About 1% of children are born with congenital heart defects, regardless of whether they live in a low-resource or high-resource country,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“The good news is that these children only need temporary pacing after a surgery. In about seven days or so, most patients’ hearts will self-repair. But those seven days are absolutely critical.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Now, we can place this tiny pacemaker on a child’s heart and stimulate it with a soft, gentle, wearable device.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“And no additional surgery is necessary to remove it.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The project builds on a previous collaboration between Prof Rogers and Prof Efimov, in which they developed the first dissolvable device for temporary pacing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many patients require temporary pacemakers after heart surgery, either while waiting for a permanent pacemaker or to help restore normal heart rate during their recovery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Although it can work with hearts of all sizes, the engineers say it is particularly well-suited to the tiny, fragile hearts of new-born babies with congenital heart defects. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;John A. Rogers/Northwestern University&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the current standard of care, surgeons sew the electrodes onto the heart muscle during surgery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wires from the electrodes exit the front of a patient’s chest, where they connect to an external pacing box that delivers a current to control the heart’s rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;When the temporary pacemaker is no longer needed, surgeons remove the pacemaker electrodes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But potential complications include infection, dislodgment, torn or damaged tissues, bleeding and blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Wires literally protrude from the body, attached to a pacemaker outside the body,” Efimov said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When the pacemaker is no longer needed, a physician pulls it out. The wires can become enveloped in scar tissue. So, when the wires are pulled out, that can potentially damage the heart muscle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That’s actually how Neil Armstrong died. He had a temporary pacemaker after a bypass surgery. When the wires were removed, he experienced internal bleeding.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rogers said that their original pacemaker worked well, but the size of its receiver antenna limited their ability to miniaturize it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;That it dissolves also eliminates the scar tissue usually created by removal. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;John A. Rogers/Northwestern University&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Instead of using the radio frequency scheme for wireless control, we developed a light-based scheme for turning the pacemaker on and delivering stimulation pulses to the surface of the heart,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This is one feature that allowed us to dramatically reduce the size.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research team also reimagined its power source.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Instead of using near-field communication to supply power, the new pacemaker operates through the action of a galvanic cell, a simple battery that transforms chemical energy into electrical energy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When the pacemaker is implanted into the body, the surrounding biofluids act as the conducting electrolyte that electrically joins those two metal pads to form the battery,” Rogers said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A very tiny light-activated switch on the opposite side from the battery allows us to turn the device from its ‘off’ state to an ‘on’ state upon delivery of light that passes through the patient’s body from the skin-mounted patch.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the patient’s heart rate drops below a certain rate, the wearable device detects the event and automatically activates a light-emitting diode.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“Because it’s so small, this pacemaker can be integrated with almost any kind of implantable device,” one of the scientists said. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;JohnARogers/NorthwesternUni/SWNS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The light then flashes on and off at a rate that corresponds to the normal heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Infrared light penetrates very well through the body,” Efimov siad. “If you put a flashlight against your palm, you will see the light glow through the other side of your hand.”&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Rogers added explained that the heart requires a tiny amount of electrical stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“By minimizing the size, we dramatically simplify the implantation procedures, we reduce trauma and risk to the patient and, with the dissolvable nature of the device, we eliminate any need for secondary surgical extraction procedures,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We could incorporate our pacemakers into other medical devices like heart valve replacements, which can cause heart block,” Efimov added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Northwestern team say the technology’s versatility opens other possibilities for use in bioelectronic medicines, including helping nerves and bones heal, treating wounds and blocking pain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Because it’s so small, this pacemaker can be integrated with almost any kind of implantable device,” Rogers said.&lt;/p&gt;

Dr. Harrison was not involved in the new study, but has done &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03201-5" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;other research&lt;/a&gt; indicating that shingles vaccines lower dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Whether the protection can last beyond seven years can only be determined with further research. But with few currently effective treatments or preventions, Dr. Harrison said, shingles vaccines appear to have “some of the strongest potential protective effects against dementia that we know of that are potentially usable in practice.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Shingles cases stem from the virus that causes childhood chickenpox, varicella-zoster, which typically remains dormant in nerve cells for decades. As people age and their immune systems weaken, the virus can reactivate and cause shingles, with symptoms like burning, tingling, painful blisters and numbness. The nerve pain can become chronic and disabling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

While good listening improves how people feel about a conversation and reduces defensiveness, it doesn’t enhance the impact of persuasive messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the study found that sharing compelling personal narratives—especially on polarizing topics like immigration—significantly and durably shifts attitudes. This suggests that &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; is said may matter more than &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; empathetically it’s delivered, at least when it comes to changing deeply held political beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narratives Persuade:&lt;/strong&gt; Personal stories changed views more than active listening.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listening Builds Rapport:&lt;/strong&gt; It reduced defensiveness but didn’t increase persuasion.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Narrative-driven conversations led to lasting attitude shifts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Hebrew University of Jerusalem&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study reveals that while high-quality, nonjudgmental listening improves how people feel about a conversation—reducing defensiveness and enhancing perceptions of the listener—it does not make persuasive messages more effective at changing attitudes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a large-scale field experiment on immigration, the researchers found that sharing a compelling personal narrative significantly and durably shifted participants’ views, regardless of whether the speaker practiced active listening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108373"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/listening-trust-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/listening-trust-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/listening-trust-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/listening-trust-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/listening-trust-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/listening-trust-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/listening-trust-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/listening-trust-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows two people talking." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/listening-trust-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/listening-trust-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/listening-trust-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/listening-trust-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/listening-trust-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/listening-trust-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/listening-trust-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;But does listening actually change minds? Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This challenges the widespread belief that listening is essential for persuasion, suggesting instead that what is said may matter more than how empathetically it is delivered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their study, published in the &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&lt;/em&gt;, challenges long-held beliefs about the power of listening to facilitate persuasion. The research was led by Dr. Roni Porat from the Department of International Relations and Political Science at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, in collaboration with Dr. Erik Santoro (Columbia University), Dr. David E. Broockman (University of California), and Dr. Joshua L. Kalla (Yale University).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For decades, scholars and practitioners have promoted the idea that high-quality, nonjudgmental listening can reduce defensiveness and increase openness during difficult conversations, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of persuasion. But does listening actually change minds?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To rigorously test this assumption, the research team conducted a large-scale, preregistered field experiment involving nearly 1,500 U.S. participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants engaged in 10-minute video conversations with trained canvassers acting as confederates. The topic was in-state tuition for unauthorized immigrants—a highly contentious and socially relevant issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a randomized design—a technique that previous work has established is effective at persuasion—the study included some conversations that included a persuasive personal narrative about an undocumented immigrant, while others did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independently, some canvassers practiced high-quality nonjudgmental listening, while others did not. Researchers measured participants’ attitudes both immediately after the conversation and five weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were striking. Persuasive narratives alone led to meaningful, lasting changes in attitudes toward undocumented immigrants and related policy positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-quality listening, while it improved perceptions of the persuader and reduced emotional defensiveness, did not enhance the persuasive effect of the narrative. These findings suggest that while listening can foster better interpersonal connection, it may not directly amplify persuasion as commonly assumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This challenges a foundational assumption in how we approach dialogue across divides,” said Dr. Porat. “While listening has clear interpersonal value, its role in changing minds may be more limited than previously thought.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study has important implications for political organizers, conflict mediators, and anyone working to bridge social and ideological divides. It suggests that the content of what is said—particularly personal narratives—may matter more for persuasion than how it is said, at least when it comes to deeply held political attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychology research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.huji.ac.il/huji/eng/index_e.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Roni Porat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.huji.ac.il/huji/eng/index_e.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Hebrew University of Jerusalem&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Roni Porat – Hebrew University of Jerusalem&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2421982122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Listen for a change?

A longitudinal field experiment on listening’s potential to enhance persuasion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scholars and practitioners widely posit that listening to other people enhances efforts to persuade them. Listening may enhance persuasion by promoting cognitive processing, reducing defensiveness, and improving perceptions of the persuader. However, empirical tests of this widely theorized hypothesis are surprisingly scarce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We review the case for and against this hypothesis, arguing previous research has not sufficiently attended to reasons why listening may not enhance persuasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We test this hypothesis using a preregistered, well-powered field experiment in which trained professional canvassers, acting as confederates, had ∼10 min video conversations with U.S. participants (&lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 1,485) about unauthorized immigration, a salient topic of disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We independently randomized whether confederates shared a persuasive narrative about an undocumented immigrant and whether they practiced high-quality nonjudgmental listening to participants’ opinions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We measured outcomes immediately after the conversation and again five weeks later. Sharing a persuasive narrative meaningfully and durably reduced prejudice and changed policy attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The listening manipulation also successfully improved perceptions of the persuader and increased processing. Surprisingly, however, the listening manipulation did not enhance persuasion: Sharing a persuasive narrative was just as effective in the absence of high-quality listening. We discuss theoretical and practical implications.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 13:20:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE5na0VNdFJzOU9HLUN0MkdPUUdBV0tjenBGcjlhZDl1WFVjTTdlbWR4RHVlMmc5bHNWSHlEMm5WSVhKal9wOHlQdHdUTHBIamN4OXJtMkhqQWY5QkxHdUJQWWNZeFlCbnlvaElFQ1FzRQ</guid></item><item><title>Nutritionist reveals why intermittent fasting may be MORE effective for weight loss than cutting calories - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxQRV9PYVgxN2hib3lvcm8zTVlJSllTWTBfMHFxenNMVHBOTXZuUkRNeEdTeWtLT1o3ZG05NUdZXy1TZThtUjVkdHZBR3c3cm9BX2Q2dC1naGNWblB5NWszZzZnUGltLUd1WExQZXp4SEo3X05VemdIYWpFQnBEclFzYWNBY3FzTHNEQk5vU3laREVWYTJkaEE0cE05WmhVS1FhRmEzQUZUakJHandvWmNvQdIBtgFBVV95cUxQUmtwUUZlOWdGTVl4NWE2Vi1IdUxyWnplanFnaFRuWWM3WlNXOGdhRkJlS0Y1bkJBbkFpekNmaUFUMWN1MjdfMGQwTTE1al9wLWtnUEY1RzhjbFBhY3UyOWpQeUxaSDNTZ210bVJMVWtPczVYUGQ3MXZkakwzNk53SldmZmxqNWhKeS0tNkRHQWRXc1JhTk9rM0YyTF83LU8yRC14elVwdTBiZHM4RWhVcGh4LVJfZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If you've tried to &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/weight_loss/index.html" id="mol-fd8aa060-0fc5-11f0-82c0-c75d4ffa30e6"&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt; before, odds are you've tried just about everything. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the end of the day, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14140345/guide-weight-loss-jabs-experts-latest-science-health-revolution.html"&gt;most weight loss experts&lt;/a&gt; agree that as long as you're in a 'calorie deficit' - eating less calories than is required for your body to maintain its current weight - you should see results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while this seems simple in theory, it's not always as simple in execution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In fact, researchers are finding that intermittent fasting - one of the many weight loss 'hacks' you've probably tried - might be more efficient than simply cutting calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Intermittent fasting usually means cycling between periods of eating and not eating (fasting),' director of clinical education at Seca and registered dietician/nutritionist &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://thepcc.org/profiles/nina-crowley/"&gt;Nina Crowley&lt;/a&gt; told DailyMail.com. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained that the most common formats for intermittent fasting include 16:8 (where you fast for 16 hours and eat during an eight-hour window) or 5:2.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These patterns are designed to help people reduce overall energy intake without tracking every calorie,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/ANNALS-24-01631"&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, used a version called 4:3 intermittent fasting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dietician and nutritionist Nina Crowley said intermittent fasting may work for some because it feels less overwhelming than daily calorie restriction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Crowley explained that in this case, participants followed a 80 percent calories restriction on three (non-consecutive) days a week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And on the other four days, they ate without calorie targets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The control group had a daily calorie restriction - and both groups were match for overall weekly calorie deficit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But their approaches were different, proving intermittent fasting to be more effective.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This approach may feel less overwhelming for some people compared to daily calorie restriction, as it allows for more flexibility and less constant focus on food,' Crowley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The intermittent fasting group lost 7.6 percent of their body fat over 52 weeks while the calorie deficit group lost five percent.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Crowley suggested one explanation could be that the intermittent fasting group didn't have to restrict their eating every day - reducing decision fatigue and improving adherence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The [intermittent fasting] group also had lower dropout rates (19 percent vs. 27 percent), suggesting it may have been more sustainable for some,' Crowley said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;While typical intermittent fasting follows a 16:8 method, this study used a 4:3 structure (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'From a behavior change lens, people may find intermittent fasting easier to integrate because it defines boundaries (fast vs. eat) rather than asking for constant moderation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And from a metabolic standpoint, alternating fasting and feeding days may influence hormonal responses related to hunger and fat oxidation.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Crowley said that weight-loss methods should be evaluated in a more complex way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained that in this particular study, fat mass and fat-free mass were not directly assessed, which can vary whether or not people would want to use a specific method like intermittent fasting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We know from other research that prolonged or aggressive energy restriction - even in structured plans - may result in unwanted loss from muscle, especially without adequate protein intake or resistance training,' Crowley said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said a way to combat this in future studies is to couple any dietary strategy with body composition monitoring.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When we assess fat mass, muscle mass, and hydration status, we get a much more complete picture of someone's health progress,' Crowley said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sustainable weight loss should protect muscle and support energy and function - not just reduce the number on the scale.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Crowley said this study didn't take body composition or muscle mass into account (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While she agreed that intermittent fasting can be helpful for some people, she also pointed out that it's important to consider how realistically it may fit into daily life,  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Meals often serve social and emotional purposes beyond nutrition, and fasting windows may not always align with family routines, social events, or workout schedules,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Crowley also explained that those who are physically active may also rely on the timing of their meals for performance and recovery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But this is why it's important for each individual to find something that works for them and their own, unique long-term health and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'When a plan feels flexible, realistic, and aligned with someone's lifestyle, it's more likely to lead to sustainable progress - not just in weight, but in overall health and quality of life,' Crowley said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;mol-permabox id="mol-66556140-0fc9-11f0-82c0-c75d4ffa30e6"&gt;&lt;div class=" mol-factbox art-ins femail" data-version="2" id="mol-306aa300-4f00-11e9-8cac-6f0dfc36d1de" data-permabox-url="/health/fb-6847595/WHAT-INTERMITTENT-FASTING-16-8-DIET.html"&gt;&lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Intermittent fasting involves switching between days of fasting and days of eating normally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Intermittent fasting diets fall generally into two categories - time-restricted feeding, which narrows eating times to 6-8 hours per day, also known as the 16:8 diet, and 5:2 intermittent fasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 16:8 diet is a form of intermittent fasting, also known as Time Restricted Eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Followers of the eating plan fast for 16 hours a day, and eat whatever they want in the remaining eight hours - typically between 10am and 6pm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This may be more tolerable than the well-known 5:2 diet - where followers restrict their calories to 500–to-600 a day for two days a week and then eat as normal for the remaining five days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to weight loss, 16:8 intermittent fasting is believed to improve blood sugar control, boost brain function and help us live longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Many prefer to eat between noon and 8pm as this means they only need to fast overnight and skip breakfast, but can still eat lunch and dinner, along with a few snacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When you do eat, it is best to opt for healthy options like fruits, vegetables and whole grains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And drink water and unsweetened beverages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Drawbacks of the fasting plan may be that people overindulge in the hours they can eat, leading to weight gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It can also result in digestive problems over the long-term, as well as hunger, fatigue and weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/mol-permabox&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
