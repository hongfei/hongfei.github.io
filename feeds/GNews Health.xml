However, when high doses of acetaminophen are taken, or if glutathione levels are low from factors like &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alcohol/index.html" id="mol-aa5e1f00-5784-11f0-8c41-85aceef8cdd2"&gt;alcohol&lt;/a&gt; use or malnutrition, the liver's capacity to process and eliminate NAPQI becomes overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When NAPQI is not properly detoxified, it can accumulate in the liver and bind to essential cellular proteins, leading to cell injury and potentially liver failure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A top doctor has warned how a common medication could cause lasting damage in the long-term, with organ failure and dementia being among the side effects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr Melillo says the risk of liver damage increases significantly when the dose of acetaminophen exceeds 4,000mg daily in adults. This equates to more than eight Tylenol PM pills. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;He highlights that acetaminophen is an ingredient in many medicines, not just Tylenol PM, so he recommends checking to see which products contain it and the quantities. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;He doesn't recommend against acetaminophen completely but says it should be used sparingly and not habitually. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says the prevalence of it is one of the reasons why there is so much liver damage in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Liver disease in some form affects one in three Americans, adding up to 100million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In January 2011, the FDA asked manufacturers of combination drugs containing acetaminophen to limit acetaminophen doses to no more than 325 mg in each tablet or capsule. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is because there's no data showing that taking more than 325 mg per dosage unit provides additional benefit while outweighing the increased risk of liver injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the recommendations, each Tylenol PM tablet contains 500 mg of acetaminophen to relieve pain and 25 mg diphenhydramine to help you go to sleep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research also found that acetaminophen could &lt;span&gt;alter the perception of risk by making certain activities seem less dangerous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Participants in the study ingested two acetaminophen tablets (1,000 mg) of the drug or a placebo and were asked to rate certain activities based on risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those under the influence of the of the drug rated activities like bungee jumping, skydiving or starting a new career in your mid-30s as less risky than those who took the placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 2020 study, conducted by The Ohio State University, built on previous work that determined acetaminophen impacts the user's psychosis, as it was found to reduce positive and negative emotions, such as hurt feelings, concern of other's suffering and even their own joy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Melillo also dislikes Tylenol PM for its other main ingredient, diphenhydramine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This is an antihistamine, which means it blocks histamine, a chemical in the body that promotes wakefulness, leading to drowsiness and helping with sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Melillo says that most people will be more familiar with the medication by its brand name, Benadryl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Explaining why he isn't a fan of diphenhydramine, he said it could 'possibly cause memory loss.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Diphenhydramine is an anticholinergic medication, meaning it blocks the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is essential for memory and cognitive function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It is one of America's top-selling nighttime painkillers and it grosses sales close to $1 billion each year. But Dr Melillo warns that the over-the-counter (OTC) medication designed to provide temporary relief from occasional headaches and minor aches and pains is 'misused' by many patients&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By blocking its action, diphenhydramine can impair these functions, leading to memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study found that taking an anticholinergic for the equivalent of three years or more on a daily basis was associated with a 54 percent higher dementia risk than taking the same dose for three months or less. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The other side effects of diphenhydramine, Dr Melillo says, include dry mouth and urinary retention (an inability to empty the bladder).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He says for older patients, these symptoms can prove particularly troublesome as they could trigger other age-related health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If people need help sleeping, the pharmacist advises talking to a doctor about prescription medications that are available instead of turning to Tylenol PM or Benadryl, which they could become dependent upon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He adds: 'If you're someone who takes this on a blue moon, then that's fine, it's not a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But this should not be your go to medication for sleep every night... because you're gonna want to prevent long term complications.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 12:50:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxQTUx6YzhTWXFITEgwZDM2NWlvb2xsQWdMV1FwZUZzLU9tVHp2aHp1RUEwVUE1SWNCOEhkSDFjOU5aLWtxUUJydmdoT2NWTzE2SXQ3WHNkd1o2SHZDRVF0NW9qdU5MNk5kYldxYkRRUEhabUUzWnp5VW1JaWJ5bjBsZDZBOHFKdkVxc0NQVnpURWtVVDjSAZgBQVVfeXFMTnhaUExEQlYzb0xaU0JRN2hMTFlveWVwcDhiRlotWFhtc3cxLTZ4ZUZmTGptWDI1RkhCWVdUdTN2cURfT2dHOFZpU0pQZnZMeEpaOTNYOUYxTUJhZXhCMk5TWE5pX3ZCWkREX1FIb19qbUZub3NCRGtBb2R0OVBNY1B6NkNDQU8yeEtRRlRSRUNXTl91TFM1MGs</guid></item><item><title>肯塔基州麻疹爆发加剧了幼儿园儿童的恐惧-新闻 | Kentucky Measles Outbreak Raises Fear for Kindergarteners - Newser</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxOQXVOdlA5OFViU2N6Qi0zUndEenprZ1dLQnRwczU4eGZRQ3ZSYTdYSU5yRktSREJGcWFZc3I0eWYyeUctRHFUc1BIRFlQUERrRXZkQTRFdHRybFVEZ3BxdE96d1VYcnFZc1VZUjNfOEtuamRNWlpUcXBlRUkyazVGYi1Cc0N3a1FPdEtrWnIyUlVsUUhoVEFXT05IbGNpelU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="divStoryBodyAbove"&gt;

                                        A measles outbreak has emerged in central Kentucky. There are four confirmed cases: Three were confirmed in Woodford County before a fourth emerged in nearby Fayette County, per &lt;a href="https://www.wkyt.com/2025/06/30/officials-announce-measles-outbreak-central-kentucky/"&gt;WKYT&lt;/a&gt;. The Kentucky Department of Public Health has also reported a confirmed measles exposure in Jessamine County. Officials say one measles case confirmed in Todd County last week is not related to the outbreak. Kentucky's total measles cases for the year is now at 7. Six cases occurred in people who were unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unknown, with one appearing in an individual with just one dose of the two-dose measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, which is 97% effective against preventing infection.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

                                        A dozen US states are experiencing active measles outbreaks, involving three or more related cases. Major outbreaks are occurring in Texas, New Mexico, in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Alberta, and in Chihuahua, Mexico. Texas confirmed three more cases on Tuesday, bringing its total to 753, though fewer than 10 are actively infectious, per the &lt;a href="https://www.newser.com/article/e5d928e41fd6b3dc6ade087662d61c5c/kentucky-confirms-measles-outbreak-as-us-nears-its-highest-case-count-in-more-than-30-years.html"&gt;AP&lt;/a&gt;. New Mexico had counted 94 cases as of Friday. Officials in Kentucky are especially concerned because the vaccination rate among kindergartners is below 87%, compared to the national average of 93%, per &lt;a href="https://www.wtvq.com/health-officials-warn-of-measles-exposure-risk-in-central-kentucky-as-outbreak-grows/"&gt;WTVQ&lt;/a&gt;. Dr. Steven Stack, Kentucky's secretary for Health and Family Services, notes one infected person can spread measles to up to 18 others who are unvaccinated, so "the message is real simple: Get vaccinated."
                                    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3v09t005b27pff67p1v28@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After trying to conceive for 18 years, one couple is now pregnant with their first child thanks to the power of artificial intelligence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000k3b6nrr2y9w57@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The couple had undergone several rounds of in vitro fertilization, or IVF, visiting fertility centers around the world in the hopes of having a baby.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmf201m00053b6m9awjjxfe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The IVF process involves removing a woman’s egg and combining it with sperm in a laboratory to create an embryo, which is then implanted in the womb.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbu8oa00093b6nf0ghsnlj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But for this couple, the IVF attempts were unsuccessful due to azoospermia, a rare condition in which no measurable sperm are present in the male partner’s semen, which can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK578191/" target="_blank"&gt;male infertility&lt;/a&gt;. A typical semen sample contains hundreds of millions of sperm, but men with azoospermia have such low counts that no sperm cells can be found, even after hours of meticulous searching under a microscope.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000l3b6n3lvqcy8p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So the couple, who wish to remain anonymous to protect their privacy, went to the Columbia University Fertility Center to try a novel approach.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmdnudj00013b6m68o4dsgg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s called the STAR method, and it uses AI to help identify and recover hidden sperm in men who once thought they had no sperm at all. All the husband had to do was leave a semen sample with the medical team.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmbx31v000i3b6n338hjj9h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We kept our hopes to a minimum after so many disappointments,” the wife said in an emailed statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000m3b6nphdol06y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers at the fertility center analyzed the semen sample with the AI system. Three hidden sperm were found, recovered and used to fertilize the wife’s eggs via IVF, and she became the first successful pregnancy enabled by the STAR method.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcme7brl00003b6n519tsg40@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The baby is due in December.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000p3b6ne6bxhskd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It took me two days to believe I was actually pregnant,” she said. “I still wake up in the morning and can’t believe if this is true or not. I still don’t believe I am pregnant until I see the scans.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmdkgvw00003b6makwzv38y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Artificial intelligence has advanced the field of fertility care in the United States: More medical facilities are using AI to help assess egg quality or screen for healthy embryos when patients are undergoing IVF. There’s still more research and testing needed,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;but AI may now be making advancements in male infertility, in particular.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn00053b6nbppfof31@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Zev Williams, director of the &lt;a href="https://www.obgyn.columbia.edu/profile/s-z-williams-md" target="_blank"&gt;Columbia University Fertility Center&lt;/a&gt;, and his colleagues spent five years developing the STAR method to help detect and recover&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;sperm in semen samples from people who had azoospermia.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmcocek001g3b6nb5iw4wtz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            They were struck by the system’s results.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn00063b6n53a8t9tu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A patient provided a sample, and highly skilled technicians looked for two days through that sample to try to find sperm. They didn’t find any. We brought it to the AI-based STAR System. In one hour, it found 44 sperm. So right then, we realized, ‘Wow, this is really a game-changer. This is going to make such a big difference for patients,’ ” said Williams, who led the research team.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn00073b6n5b0i8yv9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When a semen sample is placed on a specially designed chip under a microscope, the STAR system – which stands for Sperm Tracking and Recovery – connects to the microscope through a high-speed camera and high-powered imaging technology to scan the sample, taking more than 8 million images in under an hour to find what it has been trained to identify as a sperm cell.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmdwait000a3b6m9d9vwgat@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The system instantly isolates that sperm cell into a tiny droplet of media, allowing embryologists to recover cells that they may never have been able&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to find or identify with their own eyes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000a3b6nr2rsfwqm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s like searching for a needle scattered across a thousand haystacks, completing the search in under an hour and doing it so gently, without any harmful lasers or stains, that the sperm can still be used to fertilize an egg,” Williams said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000b3b6neqpgfn97@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “What’s remarkable is that instead of the usual [200 million] to 300 million sperm in a typical sample, these patients may have just two or three. Not 2 [million] or 3 million, literally two or three,” he said. “But with the precision of the STAR system and the expertise of our embryologists, even those few can be used to successfully fertilize an egg.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmcm3z7z2001h3b6nobm6mw1c@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="shocking-and-unexpected-diagnosis" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        ‘Shocking and unexpected diagnosis’
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000c3b6njwx4o87g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s estimated that the male partner accounts for &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK562258/" target="_blank"&gt;up to 40% of all infertility cases&lt;/a&gt; in the United States, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8304267/" target="_blank"&gt;up to 10% of men with infertility&lt;/a&gt; are azoospermic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000d3b6n566ixjxe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This often is a really heartbreaking and shocking and unexpected diagnosis,” Williams said. “Most men who have azoospermia feel completely healthy and normal. There’s no impairment of their sexual function, and the semen looks normal, too. The difference is that when you look at it under a microscope, instead of seeing literally hundreds of millions of sperm swimming, you just see cell debris and fragments but no sperm.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000e3b6n2kkpl6pw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Treatment options for azoospermia traditionally have included uncomfortable surgery to retrieve sperm directly from a patient’s testes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000f3b6n1f32g6kj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A part of the testes gets removed and broken into little pieces, and you try to find sperm there,” Williams said. “It’s invasive. You can only do it a couple of times before there could be permanent scarring and damage to the testes, and it’s painful.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000g3b6nlayijq6r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other treatment options may include prescription hormone medications – but that will be effective only if the person has an imbalance of hormones. If no other treatment options are successful, couples may use donor sperm to have a child.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000h3b6nfazdmddn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Williams said the STAR method can be a new option.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000r3b6nzmr8x1iz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It really was a team effort to develop this, and that’s what really drove and motivated everybody, the fact that you can now help couples who otherwise couldn’t have that opportunity,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmd0ojx001k3b6nboa02uji@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the method is currently available only at the Columbia University Fertility Center, Williams and his colleagues want to publish their work and share it with other fertility centers. Using the STAR method to find, isolate and freeze sperm for a patient would cost a little under $3,000 total, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljn000s3b6n77914d6x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Infertility is unique in a way in that it’s such an ancient part of the human experience. It’s literally biblical. It’s something we’ve had to contend with through all of human history,” he said. “It’s amazing to think that the most advanced technologies that we currently have are being used to solve this really ancient problem.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo000u3b6nqagmocpi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s not the first time doctors have turned to AI to help men with azoospermia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo000v3b6nb4j8uy2q@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A separate &lt;a href="https://www.med.ubc.ca/news/could-ai-and-lab-grown-sperm-solve-male-infertility/" target="_blank"&gt;research team in Canada built an AI model&lt;/a&gt; that could automate and accelerate the process of searching for rare sperm in samples from men with the condition.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo000w3b6nvrjhuvqr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The reason AI is so well-suited for this is AI really relies on learning – showing it an image of what a sperm looks like, what the shape is, what characteristics it should have – and then being able to use that learning algorithm to help identify that specific image that you’re looking for,” said Dr. Sevann Helo, a urologist at Mayo Clinic with specialty interest in male infertility and male sexual dysfunction, who was not involved in the STAR method or the research in Canada.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo000x3b6n6g3k9zc2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s very exciting,” she said. “AI, in general, at least in the medical community, I think is a whole new landscape and really will revolutionize the way we look at a lot of problems in medicine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo000y3b6nreexycws@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The STAR method is a novel approach to identifying sperm, but AI has been used in many other ways within fertility medicine too, said Dr. Aimee Eyvazzadeh, a San Francisco-based reproductive endocrinologist and host of the podcast “The Egg Whisperer Show.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo000z3b6nhoja2dm4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “AI is helping us see what our eyes can’t,” Eyvazzadeh, who was not involved in the development of STAR, wrote in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcmd8au2001n3b6n70uul4j5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For instance, AI algorithms, such as one called &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36543475/" target="_blank"&gt;Stork-A&lt;/a&gt;, have been used to analyze early-stage embryos and predict with “surprising accuracy” which ones are likely to be healthy. Another AI tool, &lt;a href="https://fairtility.com/chloe-oq-for-egg-freezing/" target="_blank"&gt;CHLOE&lt;/a&gt;, can assess the quality of a woman’s eggs before she may freeze them for future use.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “AI is being used to &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-024-69165-1)&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7Cjacqueline.howard%40cnn.com%7C57301b9705d140e3eea608ddb863de2d%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638869461590674962%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=WfIPNAt%2BkdC3VLsu8oCloN1BLlfIetvapZnKGcDGRI8%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;personalize IVF medication protocols&lt;/a&gt;, making cycles more efficient and less of a guessing game. It’s also helping with sperm selection, identifying the healthiest sperm even in difficult samples. And AI can now even predict IVF success rates with more precision than ever before, using massive data sets to give patients personalized guidance,” Eyvazzadeh said. “The common thread? Better decisions, more confidence, and a more compassionate experience for patients.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo00113b6nosmdqou5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The new STAR system is “a game-changer,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo00123b6nbahldhut@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “AI isn’t creating sperm – it’s helping us find the rare, viable ones that are already there but nearly invisible,” she said. “It’s a breakthrough not because it replaces human expertise, but because it amplifies it – and that’s the future of fertility care.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo00133b6n259x5wq6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But there is also a growing concern that the rushed application of AI in reproductive medicine could give false hope to patients, said Dr. Gianpiero Palermo, professor of embryology and director of andrology and assisted fertilization at Weill Cornell Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo00143b6n7vkza32k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “AI is gaining a lot of traction nowadays to offer unbiased evaluation on embryos by looking at embryo morphology,” Palermo said in an email. “However, current available models are still somewhat inconsistent and require additional validation.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo00153b6nlg6c7r0x@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Palermo said the STAR approach needs to be validated and would still require human embryologists to pick up sperm and inject them into an egg to create an embryo for patients undergoing IVF.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm5nlno00003b6mtrtqj5v0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Maybe the AI addition may help to retrieve the spermatozoon a little faster and maybe one more than the embryologist,” said Palermo, who was not involved in the development of STAR but was the first to describe the method of injecting sperm directly into an egg. Since he &lt;a href="https://weillcornell.org/gianpiero-palermo-md" target="_blank"&gt;pioneered that method&lt;/a&gt;, it has become the most-utilized assisted reproductive technology in the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3vljo00163b6nmy8typeo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In my opinion, this approach is faulty because inevitably some men will have no spermatozoa,” Palermo said of the STAR method, “doesn’t matter how their specimens are screened whether by humans or a machine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Alcohol-related deaths generally, which include myriad other causes besides liver problems, &lt;a href="/story/news/health/2025/01/10/wisconsins-alcohol-related-deaths-more-than-tripled-since-1999/77575822007/" data-t-l=":b|e|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;increased three-fold in Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; between 1999 and 2020, a January analysis from the Journal Sentinel found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But experts say multidisciplinary treatment, reduced stigma around alcohol use disorder, and a renewed emphasis on education and prevention could improve the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"I think the narrative often in Wisconsin is just, 'Oh, we're just big drinkers,' and that's all there is," said Maureen Busalacchi, director of the Wisconsin Alcohol Policy Project at the Medical College of Wisconsin. "The message is not that you can't drink at all. It's more, really think about it, and just drink less."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;How does excessive alcohol consumption affect the liver?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/alcohol/info" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;dietary guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for alcohol urge people of drinking age to limit consumption to one drink or fewer per day for women and two drinks or fewer per day for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When people consume significant amounts of alcohol over a prolonged period of time, fat begins to turn up in the liver, and then scar tissue, which can lead to cirrhosis, said Dr. Rita German, a transplant hepatologist at UW Health in Madison. Many times, German said, liver disease symptoms such as jaundice, fever and confusion don't show themselves until the disease has progressed, making it harder to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;What does the data show?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Nearly 3,000 Wisconsinites died from alcohol-related liver diseases from 2019 to 2023, CDC data show. The large majority — 2,072 — were from cirrhosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Deaths from most types of liver diseases due to alcohol consumption increased in those years, including alcoholic fatty liver and alcoholic hepatic failure in addition to cirrhosis. Deaths from alcoholic hepatitis fell slightly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Busalacchi called the numbers a huge concern. Most of these deaths are preventable, she contended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;Why are these diseases showing up in younger adults?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Doctors used to think of alcohol-related liver diseases as affecting people past middle age, German said. But increasingly, that age is dropping. At UW Health's &lt;a href="https://www.uwhealth.org/locations/digestive-health-center-254/digestive-health-center-alcohol-related-liver-disease-and-alcohol-use-disorder-clinic" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;multidisciplinary clinic&lt;/a&gt; for patients with such diseases, she said, the average age is now 45, and she's treated some as young as 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;That may seem to conflict with recent research showing young people, &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/why-gen-z-is-drinking-less" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;particularly Gen Z, drinking less&lt;/a&gt;. But while some are cutting back, those who do drink are drinking more heavily, Busalacchi said. And while alcohol use among Wisconsin high schoolers has generally decreased in recent years, more than one in 10 reported binge drinking in the last 30 days on the state's &lt;a href="https://dpi.wi.gov/sites/default/files/imce/sspw/pdf/WI_2023_YRBS_Summary.pdf" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;most recent Youth Risk Behavior Survey, done in 2023.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The JAMA study noted, in particular, increases in alcohol-related liver disease deaths among adults ages 25-44. Deaths among women also increased disproportionately. Women absorb more alcohol into their bloodstream because they're generally smaller than men and because women's bodies have &lt;a href="https://adp.sa.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2021-05/alcohol_-_genderdifferences.pdf" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;less gastric alcohol dehydrogenase&lt;/a&gt;, the enzyme that breaks down alcohol in the stomach, German said. Thus, they're at greater risk for liver damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;The Medical College of Wisconsin's liver transplant team reports younger and younger women needing transplants due to alcohol consumption, Busalacchi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;How could Wisconsin turn the tide?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;To catch alcohol-related liver diseases earlier, German said, it's critical that patients be forthcoming about their alcohol use at the doctor's office. And for that to happen, she said, doctors must view alcohol use disorder for what it is — a disease, not a personal failing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People who are concerned about their alcohol consumption may also request an ultrasound of their liver, German said. From there, they can begin treatment if need be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;She also sees the benefits in treatment that is comprehensive. At UW Health's clinic, patients not only see doctors like German who attend to the liver, but addiction specialists and counselors to treat underlying mental health conditions that can drive alcohol use. The clinic has treated between 250 and 300 people since it began in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;If it's caught in time, fat and scarring in the liver can be reversed by abstaining from alcohol, German said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Busalacchi's work continues to focus on changing societal perceptions on drinking culture. She sees encouraging signs around the state from communities that are offering more education about the consequences of excessive drinking, especially for youth. Some are taking a harder stance on age compliance checks for alcohol sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Madeline Heim covers health and the environment for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Contact her at 920-996-7266 or &lt;a href="mailto:mheim@gannett.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;mheim@gannett.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s25"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s50"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s75"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_s gnt_ar_s100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 10:03:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiwwFBVV95cUxObEQ4SmpOMFlGOUU2OWlxeUtfSkRiUmhjZmNxbzFkRlBMaWV4bXgwRzRlWUVCX2lIWEgzRjJxV2tUamprZTg0bl9Od2Z0ZU1JYjJqay1pVDZwT0cwUkNQSk1ob3QwME5SNEE3UzA4NlZHUEV4d2k2dGk5aFRPQUR6T2EtSl84ZkNMZlFjQXlIWHBYY1BhSS1wOUhITjZ1Rm14dlc5R3E5TmY4TDR3cmxmcUl1ejBTSThKbHZUel9PdVROZlk</guid></item><item><title>饮酒对老年人的影响-《纽约时报》 | How Drinking Alcohol Affects You in Older Age - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE5YcU83eWQ0S0xWZENoMVpkaUNpY2F4d2lBRGo1VEJycnBPbEJWSG1MdEc1QWNvYjVkWHlaV1lWblJsVHpPSjJCbUo0bnNMeC03NVZSeTRnT1JFYmo0TGRab01Jbmh0X2hHZTBaMmhNbkt1NDJMUEtv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jul 2025 09:00:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE5YcU83eWQ0S0xWZENoMVpkaUNpY2F4d2lBRGo1VEJycnBPbEJWSG1MdEc1QWNvYjVkWHlaV1lWblJsVHpPSjJCbUo0bnNMeC03NVZSeTRnT1JFYmo0TGRab01Jbmh0X2hHZTBaMmhNbkt1NDJMUEtv</guid></item><item><title>您是葡萄糖“勺子”吗？以下是如何修复高血糖和低血糖的方法- NPR | Are you a glucose 'dipper'?

   &lt;p&gt;By all measurements, Judy Freeman, age 76, is in fantastic health. She doesn't have diabetes or heart disease. She's not overweight. She stays active.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I try to walk at least four or five times a week," says Freeman, who's a well-known potter in Alpine, Texas. "I also work about 20 hours in the studio." &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But in the past year or so, Freeman hasn't felt like herself. She's been more tired and sluggish. And she has had more trouble shedding a little extra weight. "I try and I can't lose it," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So Freeman decided to experiment with a new technology for a few weeks: a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/09/nx-s1-5418465/blood-sugar-glucose-monitor-metabolic-health" target="_blank"&gt;continuous glucose monitor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;It's a small patch that inserts a needle into your skin. The device estimates your blood sugar every few minutes and sends the value to an app on your phone. You can track how various foods you eat alter your blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Freeman wondered if the extra information about her blood sugar might give her insight into why she felt so sluggish and stuck in her weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-75283" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;On the first day, she uncovered a big clue: About two hours after lunch, her blood sugar nosedived below her baseline levels.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;Dips trigger overeating&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Studies &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38363342/" target="_blank"&gt;have shown conclusively&lt;/a&gt; that these monitors greatly help&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6712232/" target="_blank"&gt; people manage diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. But in 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-over-counter-continuous-glucose-monitor" target="_blank"&gt;the FDA approved &lt;/a&gt;the first continuous glucose monitors for people without diabetes. Now, two companies, Dexcom and Abbott, sell and market the devices to anyone who wants to track their blood sugar. They cost about $50 and last for a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But scientists are still trying to figure out if — and how — these monitors could help people without diabetes. Can the data motivate people to eat a healthier diet by helping them learn how food affects their bodies?&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;One of the scientists leading this effort is &lt;a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/sarah-berry" target="_blank"&gt;Sarah Berry, a nutritionist &lt;/a&gt;at King's College London. She's also chief scientist at the &lt;a href="https://zoe.com/en-us" target="_blank"&gt;company Zoe&lt;/a&gt;, which sells personalized nutrition plans that incorporate these devices.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In collaboration with Massachusetts General Hospital and Stanford University, Berry and her colleagues led two&lt;a href="https://zoe.com/our-studies" target="_blank"&gt; large studies&lt;/a&gt; in which thousands of people without diabetes wear continuous glucose monitors while they eat tens of thousands of meals.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;After analyzing all of their data, Berry says one finding stands out: "A big proportion of people are what we call dippers," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;If you're a dipper, your blood sugar sometimes acts in a specific way: After eating carbohydrates, it rises quickly, and then about two to three hours later, it sometimes plummets low, below your baseline, or fasting, level.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So you'll have this big increase followed by this big crash," Berry says. "Not everyone gets these dips, but we see that quite a high proportion of people do."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These dips can trigger overeating, their study found, so it may make it harder to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If you are dipping, then you feel &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/10/30/1208883691/diet-ozempic-wegovy-weight-loss-fiber-glp-1-diabetes-barley" target="_blank"&gt;more hungry more quickly&lt;/a&gt;, and on average you tend to eat 80 calories more at the next meal and 320 calories more over a whole day," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;But eating more wasn't the only problem with dips. Berry's team has found that the sugar crashes also correlated with a person's mood. During a dip, people tended to feel less alert and more fatigued, she and her colleagues &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-021-00383-x" target="_blank"&gt;reported in the journal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;These conclusions line up with previous studies on people with diabetes, says &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/dalia-perelman" target="_blank"&gt;Dalia Perelman&lt;/a&gt;, who's a research dietitian at Stanford University and wasn't involved in this research.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When your blood sugar is high, people tend to be lethargic, fatigued, and thirsty," Perelman says. "You're just like, ugh."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When your blood sugar is low, you're jittery. You can have heart palpitations. And you become super hungry. "Low blood sugar gives your body very strong signals," she says. "You really feel terrible,"  which brings us back to Judy Freeman in Alpine, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The first day Freeman wore the glucose monitor, she ate lunch as usual. About two hours later, she started to feel horrible. "I had this really sinking feeling. It was a sort of anxiety or depression. I felt like if I don't get up, I'm just going to stop breathing and die. It was so overpowering," Freeman says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;When Freeman glanced at the monitor, she could hardly believe what she saw: "My blood sugar had shot up at some point, and then it plummeted down to the lowest point."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This sinking feeling wasn't new to Freeman. She's had it from time to time. "I just never, ever thought it was in any way correlated with what I ate or anything like that.&lt;em&gt;"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If you are concerned that your blood sugar may be fluctuating wildly and you want to even things out, here are three things you can try:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;1. Put some clothes on those carbs&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Don't eat meals and snacks that consist mostly of carbohydrates, Perelman says. "Don't eat naked carbs."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Instead, eat them with protein and healthy fats. That means oils from vegetables, seeds and nuts, but also fats from fish. So add eggs to breakfast, canned fish for lunch or tofu for dinner.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;On top of that,&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/09/19/1196977677/easy-ways-to-add-more-fiber-to-your-diet" target="_blank"&gt; add more fiber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;— &lt;em&gt;lots more.&lt;/em&gt; For that, the go-to ingredient is beans, says &lt;a href="https://twu.edu/faculty-profiles/college-of-health-sciences/mindy-a-patterson-phd-rdn/" target="_blank"&gt;nutritionist Mindy Patterson&lt;/a&gt; at the Texas Woman's University. "You really have to eat beans to get enough fiber in your diet," she says. (Chia seeds are another great source of fiber.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Fiber and protein together&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/10/30/1208883691/diet-ozempic-wegovy-weight-loss-fiber-glp-1-diabetes-barley" target="_blank"&gt; put a speed bump &lt;/a&gt;on your digestion," says clinical &lt;a href="https://www.realfood-matters.net/" target="_blank"&gt;nutritionist Karen Kennedy&lt;/a&gt;. "They really stabilize your blood sugar."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;2. Sprinkle the carbs throughout the day&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To prevent dips, you want your gut to slowly drip carbs into your blood, not douse it with a deluge of sugars, Perelman says. So don't eat a bunch of carbohydrates all at one meal.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For preventing dips, "it doesn't matter how many carbs you ate throughout the day," she says. "It matters how many carbs you've had at each meal."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;3. Pay attention to what you eat first at a meal&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;With food, order matters, too. Eat the protein, fiber and fat &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; at a meal and the carbs &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt;, Kennedy says.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Say you're having a steak, salad and baked potato for dinner. "If you eat the salad and the steak first, and then the potato, you'll see that you don't have as much of a spike in blood sugar or as much of a drop afterwards," she says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;If your blood sugar keeps a more even keel, then your mood and hunger will do the same.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And here's the great part: You don't need to buy a glucose monitor to figure this out, says Sarah Berry at King's College London. Simply pay attention to how you feel about two hours after a meal. If you get moody, anxious or super hungry, you're probably a dipper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Alarming projections by the National Cancer Institute estimate that in 2025 alone, there will be 313,780 new cases of prostate cancer—accounting for 15.4% of all new cancer diagnoses in men—and approximately 35,770 deaths, representing 5.8% of all cancer-related fatalities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These figures aren’t just numbers, they're a wake-up call. They point up the pressing need to raise awareness, enhance early detection, and prioritise treatment strategies for a disease that begins in the prostate—a small but vital gland in the male reproductive system. As the global burden of prostate cancer continues to rise, understanding its implications is no longer optional as it’s essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is prostate cancer?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prostate is a small but essential gland in the male reproductive system, located just below the bladder and above the pelvic muscles. About the size of a chestnut, it weighs approximately 30 grams and plays a crucial role in producing the fluid that forms a key component of semen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer arises when cells grow uncontrollably, disrupting the body’s normal functioning. Prostate cancer, similarly, develops when cells in the prostate gland begin to multiply in an unregulated and abnormal manner, potentially leading to serious health complications if not detected and treated early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is &lt;keyword id="27604823" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="early-stage-prostate-cancer" source="keywords"&gt;early-stage prostate cancer&lt;/keyword&gt;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staging of cancer Staging describes or classifies a cancer based on how much cancer there is in the body and where it is when first diagnosed. When prostate cancer cells remain confined to the gland itself—or have only slightly extended beyond it without spreading to distant parts of the body—the condition is referred to as localised prostate cancer. However, once the cancer spreads beyond nearby tissues, it progresses into what's commonly called advanced prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under TNN system given by AJCC (American Joint Committee on Cancer, Prostate cancer is generally classified into four stages by :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early Stage (Stages I &amp;amp; II): The tumor is limited to the prostate and hasn’t spread elsewhere. This is also known as “localized prostate cancer” and is often more responsive to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Locally Advanced (Stage III): The cancer has begun to grow beyond the prostate, invading nearby tissues such as the seminal vesicles, but has not reached distant organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advanced or Metastatic (Stage IV): The cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, such as the bones, liver, or lungs. This stage is more challenging to treat and is commonly referred to as advanced prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;keyword id="26911286" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="symptoms-of-prostate-cancer" source="keywords"&gt;Symptoms of prostate cancer&lt;/keyword&gt;: Warning signs to watch for&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most cases, prostate cancer does not provide noticeable symptoms in its early stages.

While medical professionals haven’t deciphered the exact causes behind the same, several risk factors have been identified by them that may increase the potential of developing prostate cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Major Risk Factors:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age: Risk of prostate cancer is directly proportional to the age of a man, it rises majorly after age 50. The prostate naturally enlarges with age, increasing vulnerability (American Cancer Society).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Family History: According to the American Cancer Society, “Having a father or brother with prostate cancer more than doubles a man’s risk of developing this disease. (The risk is higher for men who have a brother with the disease than for those who have a father with it.) The risk is much higher for men with several affected relatives, particularly if their relatives were young when the cancer was found.” Therefore, a close relative (father, brother, grandfather) with prostate cancer increases one’s risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inherited Gene Mutations: BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene (both play an important role in DNA repair) changes, often linked to breast and ovarian cancers, can also raise prostate cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obesity: Obese individuals may face more aggressive forms of prostate cancer and a higher chance of recurrence after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smoking: In the study on Cigarette smoking and prostate cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies published in National Library of Medicine, Data from observational studies suggest that cigarette smoking has an inverse association with prostate cancer incidence. Basically, suggesting that smokers have a higher risk of recurrence of prostate cancer and metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How is prostate cancer diagnosed&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors use the following tests to check for signs of prostate cancer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Digital Rectal Exam (DRE)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Test&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Imaging Tests&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prostate Biopsy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Healthy habits that help prevent prostate cancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s always better to focus on prevention when it comes to your health.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating a protein-rich diet can have several health benefits. If you struggle to get enough protein to meet your body’s needs, incorporating high-protein foods into snacks can help you reach your protein goal. We spoke with registered dietitians to find out why protein is so important—plus, which high-protein foods should make it into your snack rotation.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Protein is an essential macronutrient that is important for health and well-being. “Protein plays a key role in the body’s ability to build muscle, repair tissue, regulate hormones and perform other cellular functions like metabolism,” says &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cayleigh-mckenna-rd-ldn-81b7551a8/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cayleigh McKenna, RD&lt;/a&gt;, nutrition consultant at Houston Family Nutrition.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because protein is essential for building and maintaining muscle, physically active people should emphasize protein in their meals and snacks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding protein to snacks can offer several benefits, including long-lasting energy and increased satiety. “Protein-rich snacks can help you feel fuller for longer, promoting a sense of nourishment and satisfaction,” says &lt;a href="https://www.honesthealthandwellness.com/#about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Andrea Hinojosa, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Honest Health &amp;amp; Wellness. “Many high-protein snacks are also rich in other essential nutrients, contributing to overall health and well-being,” she adds. Eating protein with snacks may also balance blood sugar, improve heart health and reduce cravings later in the day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned fish is a quick high-protein option for snacks. You can even purchase “canned” fish in travel-friendly pouches, making them the perfect protein-rich snack when you’re on the go. Canned salmon has about 18 grams of protein per 3-ounce serving, while canned tuna has about 22 grams per serving.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “They also provide omega-3 fatty acids, beneficial for heart health and brain function,” adds Hinojosa.

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another portable and easy option for snacking is string cheese. One stick has about 8 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “For high-protein snacks, I love a turkey and cheese roll-up. I use a cheese stick and two slices of deli turkey or chicken and roll it up together. It’s really satisfying,” says &lt;a href="http://linkedin.com/in/katie-d-78a88838" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Katie Drakeford, M.A., RD&lt;/a&gt;, owner of Drakeford Consulting.

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Jerky is a great high-protein snack option—and it’s especially handy if you can’t keep things cold.

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Deli turkey is another high-protein snack option. Just one slice of deli turkey has 6 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Enjoy a couple of slices on crackers, layer a few slices with cheese on top of cucumber slices or make a grown-up snack box with turkey, cheese, grapes and crackers.

And it’s worth it to do so: 1 cup of low-fat cottage cheese has about 24 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “A cup of cottage cheese with berries or pineapple is another go-to when looking to up protein intake,” says Drakeford.

			&lt;p&gt;Simply using your food packaging in the manner it's supposed to be used is enough to contaminate your comestibles with a sprinkling of microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A painstaking review of 103 scientific studies on microplastic food contamination found actions as simple as opening a plastic drink bottle or using a plastic chopping board can shave off tiny particles of common polymers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even glass bottles that use a plastic gasket, plastic-lined pizza boxes, plastic-lined disposable  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/how-does-caffeine-wake-you-up" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73115" data-postid="166048" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;coffee&lt;/a&gt; cups, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-single-tea-bag-could-release-billions-of-microplastics-into-the-body"&gt;plastic tea bags&lt;/a&gt;, plastic wrappings, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microwaving-safe-plastics-can-release-billions-of-particles-scientists-warn"&gt;microwaveable plastic containers&lt;/a&gt; shed microplastic like a Persian cat sheds fur in spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem, a team led by biologist Lisa Zimmermann of the non-profit Food Packaging Forum in Switzerland says, is ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-could-accumulate-in-our-brains-more-than-in-kidneys-and-livers?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Microplastics Could Accumulate in Our Brains More Than in Kidneys And Livers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first systematic evidence of how normal and intended use of foodstuffs packaged in plastics can be contaminated with micro- and nanoplastics," &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/06/24/health/microplastics-food-packaging-study-wellness"&gt;Zimmermann told CNN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We found food packaging is actually a direct source of the micro- and nanoplastics measured in food."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more scientists look into micro- and nanoplastics, or MNPs, the more we see just how widespread they have become. These are tiny pieces of material, too small to see, released by a variety of polymers as they're used or break up in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plastic is ubiquitous in our modern society, providing a cheap, easily manufactured solution to everything from storage to clothing to furnishings. In recent decades it has become clear its resistance to degrading doesn't mean it is impervious to crumbling into smaller fragments, which easily filter through ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have found microplastics throughout the human body, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-found-in-every-human-placenta-tested-study-finds"&gt;including placentas&lt;/a&gt;. It's been found in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-infiltrate-every-organ-including-brain-study-in-mice-shows"&gt;every major organ in mice&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/microplastics-absorbed-by-fetus-persist-after-birth-study-in-mice-finds"&gt;their fetuses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this even more worrying is that we just have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/toxicologists-urge-for-research-into-the-unknown-health-risks-of-microplastic"&gt;very little idea about the health impacts&lt;/a&gt;, although it's not looking promising: A study last year found that cardiac and stroke  patients with a high concentration of microplastics in their carotid artery plaque &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822"&gt;had a significantly elevated risk of death&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zimmermann and her colleagues examined 103 studies that have investigated the presence of plastic particles in food and food simulants. From these studies, they extracted 600 entries about food contact articles, of which 96 percent reported the presence of MNPs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those entries were also compiled into a searchable and filterable &lt;a href="https://foodpackagingforum.org/resources/databases/mino"&gt;dashboard that anyone can access&lt;/a&gt;, allowing users to home in on different types of food contact articles, from packaging to baby bottles, as well as different types of plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/glass-bottles-actually-contain-more-microplastics-scientists-find?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Glass Bottles Actually Contain More Microplastics, Scientists Find&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of particular note, the researchers found, is that multiple studies found that for some reusable plastic items, such as melamine bowls, the amount of microplastics shed increased with each wash. This suggests that repeated heating and abrasion increases the rate at which these items degrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also note that ultra-processed food contains more microplastic than minimally processed food. The reason for this is simple: more processing steps mean greater exposure to plastic food-processing equipment, resulting in more MNPs in the final product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings, the researchers say, strongly indicate that not only is a lot more research warranted, but also that more needs to be done to minimize the use of plastics in food packaging and preparation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study shows that under intended or foreseeable conditions of use, plastic food contact articles can release MNPs into foodstuffs," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41538-025-00470-3"&gt;they write in their paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The contribution of plastic food contact articles to human MNP exposure is currently unclear and warrants further investigation. Further research is also necessary to establish human health impacts associated with MNP exposures, but a precautionary approach aimed at limiting human exposure to MNPs, including from food contact articles, is prudent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://foodpackagingforum.org/resources/databases/mino"&gt;access the interactive dashboard here&lt;/a&gt;, and the paper has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41538-025-00470-3"&gt;&lt;i&gt;npj Science of Food&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A small snack can benefit cardiovascular and metabolic health, as well as promote muscle protein synthesis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; You don’t have to avoid snacking at night. And that advice stands if you’re aiming to lose weight. It's the quality of your snack that matters.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dig into this creamy &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cottage-cheese-snack-jar-with-fruit-8411316" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cottage Cheese Snack Jar with Fruit&lt;/a&gt; when hunger strikes at night.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you haven’t embraced the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8056073/cottage-cheese-mustard-dip-trend-gone-too-far/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cottage cheese craze&lt;/a&gt;, here’s your opportunity. The best late-night snack for weight loss that dietitians swear by is the trendy staple that has social media buzzing. This recipe for a cottage cheese snack jar adds diced peaches and chopped pecans for a sweet and crunchy snack.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Cottage cheese and fruit is an amazing and delicious late-night snack,” says &lt;a href="https://nutritionstarringyou.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, founder of Nutrition Starring You and author of &lt;em&gt;The Everything Easy Pre-Diabetes Cookbook&lt;/em&gt;. “The slow-digesting protein, fiber from the fruit and unsaturated fats from a sprinkle of nuts is a fabulous combo to help balance blood sugar, feed your muscles while you sleep and provide an antioxidant boost,” she explains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here’s more about why this snack staple is such a superhero before bed.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Contains Sleep-Promoting Tryptophan &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just like turkey on Thanksgiving, dairy foods are a great way to up your intake of tryptophan, says registered dietitian and certified personal trainer &lt;a href="https://enjoyfoodenjoylife.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Nicole Rodriguez, RDN&lt;/a&gt;. Tryptophan is a naturally occurring amino acid that plays an important role in the production of serotonin and sleep-regulating &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-melatonin-8663994" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;melatonin&lt;/a&gt; for sleep. Thanks to this and other amino acids found in dairy, foods like cottage cheese may help support sleep quality.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s High in Protein  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Dairy is a powerhouse when it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-high-protein-foods-to-eat-as-snacks-8674784" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-quality protein&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it contains a complete package of essential amino acids. A ½-cup serving of 1% fat cottage cheese provides 14 grams of protein for just 80 calories and 1 gram of total fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, research shows that pre-sleep protein, specifically casein, can help your body build muscle when you are engaged in a strength training program.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This supports earlier research that suggested that higher-protein diets may also help with appetite and weight management.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Choosing a low-fat dairy food like cottage cheese is a great way to add a solid source of protein into your nighttime routine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It’s Packed with Vitamins and Minerals &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cottage cheese contains calcium, magnesium, zinc and B vitamins.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Magnesium and zinc, in particular, play an important supporting role in helping convert tryptophan in dairy foods into melatonin (that circadian rhythm-regulating good sleep hormone).&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One caveat when it comes to cottage cheese is its sodium content. Traditional cottage cheese is rather high in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7882895/easy-ways-to-cut-sodium-in-your-diet/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sodium&lt;/a&gt;, with a ½-cup serving clocking in at 459 milligrams, 20% of the recommended daily limit.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If you are trying to reduce the sodium in your diet, choose a no-salt-added cottage cheese or compare the sodium content between brands and pick a lower-salt product.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Has Fiber &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While cottage cheese on its own lacks fiber, the addition of fruits and nuts gives it a nice fiber boost. This recipe supplies 3 grams of fiber. Plus, when some of that fiber comes from fruit, you’re in luck. “The addition of fruit can satisfy sweet cravings that you may be trying to minimize while pursuing a weight-loss goal,” says Rodriguez.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Has Fat  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Healthy fat sources contribute to snack satiety and satisfaction, says Rodriguez. The &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/cottage-cheese-snack-jar-with-fruit-8411316" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Cottage Cheese Snack Jar with Fruit&lt;/a&gt; has 2 tablespoons of chopped pecans, though you can change up the nuts if you’d like. Other ideas include slivered almonds, walnut pieces or chopped pistachios.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-to-consider-when-choosing-a-late-night-snack"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What to Consider When Choosing a Late-Night Snack &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Late-night snacks do not have to involve heading to the pantry to grab potato chips or cookies. (Classic TV munchies, of course.) Those snacks taste good, but there are better choices that align with weight loss. “While I encourage my patients to embrace an ‘all foods fit’ philosophy, nighttime presents its own challenges,” says Rodriguez. For example, eating spicy, fatty or fried foods can cause indigestion, while foods with a lot of added sugars can cause blood glucose spikes. Both of these can disrupt your sleep, and lack of sleep can affect your appetite and may make weight loss more difficult.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But there are two nutrients you should focus on when it comes to nighttime nibbles: protein and fiber, says Harris-Pincus. These provide staying power, she says. “Sticking with these options will help to keep blood sugar levels more stable and offer an opportunity to maximize your nutrient intake for the day.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Here are the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/our-food-and-nutrition-philosophy-6746110" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nutrition parameters&lt;/a&gt; to focus on when finding a late-night snack:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calories:&lt;/strong&gt; Aim for roughly 200 calories per snack, depending on your personal energy needs, to avoid feeling overly full before bed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein:&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure your snack choice has protein. Aiming for 7 or more grams provides a good source of protein. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiber:&lt;/strong&gt; Fiber helps keep you fuller for longer, and can also support your weight-loss goals through offering satiety, meaning you’re less likely to mindlessly munch. Aim for a snack that provides some fiber, ideally 3 or more grams. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fat:&lt;/strong&gt; Fat is your friend; it also helps to satiate you. Choose a snack that packs a little bit of unsaturated fat to help provide that staying power until your morning meal. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can enjoy a late-night snack, even if weight loss is on your radar. Consider your individual calorie, protein and nutrient needs as you explore what foods will satisfy you as well. Dietitians recommend pairing low-fat cottage cheese with fruit and nuts for a late-night option that provides protein, fat and fiber, all nutrients that support weight-loss goals.

They also nudge serotonin and dopamine signaling toward a calmer set point, offering a biochemical explanation for the behavioral change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the analysis found benefits at doses as low as 250 milligrams of combined EPA and DHA, an amount found in a single soft gel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher intakes did not guarantee bigger gains, hinting that individual genetics and baseline diet modulate the response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-omega-imbalance"&gt;The omega imbalance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most Americans don’t get enough &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/13/7/2154" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;long-chain omega‑3s&lt;/a&gt; from food alone. The average U.S. diet is heavy on &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/expert-answers/omega-6/faq-20058172" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;omega‑6 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt; – often in a 10:1 ratio to omega‑3 – which may fuel inflammation and irritability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts recommend at least two servings of fatty fish a week, such as salmon or sardines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who don’t eat seafood, even a basic supplement may close the gap and improve both physical and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-supplements-that-calm-behavior"&gt;Supplements that calm behavior&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One six‑month &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4336833/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;trial&lt;/a&gt; in 8‑ to 16‑year‑olds reported a 59 percent drop in disruptive conduct that lasted half a year after the study ended. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar shifts have shown up in adult parolees and nursing‑home residents, suggesting age is no barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public‑school cafeterias could offer &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fish-like-rainbow-trout-suffer-extreme-pain-when-killed-by-air/"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; twice a week, while correctional facilities might issue capsules at intake. Raine notes that such steps are “low cost, low risk,” especially compared with medications or restraint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond behavior, omega‑3s continue to earn cardiovascular praise. In the &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1812792" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;REDUCE‑IT trial&lt;/a&gt;, 4 grams of purified EPA cut fatal heart attacks by 25 percent among statin users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A calmer mind and a stronger heart in the same pill has obvious appeal for clinicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fewer-risks-broad-access"&gt;Fewer risks, broad access&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to prescription medications for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/dopamines-role-in-male-aggression-fades-with-fighting-experience/"&gt;aggression&lt;/a&gt;, fish oil has fewer side effects and is easier to access. It doesn’t require a prescription, and many brands are available over the counter at grocery stores or online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, fish oil should not replace professional treatment when serious behavioral issues are involved. It can be a helpful addition, but therapy, structured support, and in some cases medication are still essential tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-room-to-refine-dosing"&gt;Room to refine dosing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Omega‑3 is “not a magic bullet,” Raine warned, stressing that therapy, education, and social support still matter. Most studies followed volunteers for four months; researchers need longer follow‑ups to see whether tempers stay cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists also hope to learn why some volunteers improve more than others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/genetic-supergenes-power-explosive-evolution-in-some-fish/"&gt;Genetics&lt;/a&gt; that alter fatty‑acid metabolism, baseline inflammation, and even gut microbiota may shape response. Tailored dosing could push the average benefit beyond today’s modest figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, experts say parents of an irritable child, or adults who catch themselves snapping, might consider swapping a sugary snack for &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/many-young-salmon-break-the-typical-migration-rules-boosting-survival-chances/"&gt;salmon&lt;/a&gt;, or adding a budget fish‑oil capsule to breakfast.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A gut-healthy diet was linked to a 13% lower risk of high blood pressure in U.S. adults.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating more fiber, fermented foods and plant-based options may support gut and heart health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While gut microbes weren’t directly measured, diet-based scores still showed consistent benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is one of the most common long-term health conditions worldwide, and it can lead to serious problems like heart disease, stroke and kidney issues. It’s a big concern not just for personal health, but also for healthcare systems everywhere due to the costs associated with treating and managing it.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That’s why finding ways to prevent and manage high blood pressure is so important.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One area of research getting a lot of attention lately is diet. Some studies have indicated that eating patterns like the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/16372/8-ways-to-follow-the-mediterranean-diet-for-better-health/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/30-day-dash-diet-meal-plan-for-beginners-11738768" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291622/the-health-benefits-of-eating-a-plant-based-diet-and-how-to-get-started/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;plant-based diets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291716/low-sodium-diet-plan-1500-calories/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;low-salt diets&lt;/a&gt;, may help reduce the risk of high blood pressure and improve heart health overall. Interestingly, scientists have also discovered that the collection of tiny organisms living in your gut, known as gut microbiota, might play a key role in how diet affects blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Your gut microbiota includes bacteria, fungi and viruses that help with digestion, immune health and even inflammation. When the balance of these microbes is off—often called "&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8072214/sneaky-signs-of-unhealthy-gut-according-to-gastroenterologist/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;gut dysbiosis&lt;/a&gt;"—it may increase the risk of conditions like high blood pressure. For example, studies have shown that people with hypertension tend to have less diversity in their gut microbiota and fewer helpful bacteria.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While there’s growing interest in how diet and gut health are linked to conditions like high blood pressure, there’s still more to learn, especially about how a test called DI-GM specifically relates to hypertension. DI-GM stands for Dietary Index for Gut Microbiota, and this index looks at factors like the amount of fiber, prebiotics, fermented foods and plant-based foods in your diet—all of which help grow good microorganisms and improve gut diversity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; To bridge this research gap, a new study aimed to dig deeper into the connection between blood pressure and gut health using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), and the results were published in&lt;em&gt; BMJ Nutrition, Prevention, and Health&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-the-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was The Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To evaluate the association between dietary index for gut microbiota and hypertension, researchers used data from NHANES, a large-scale survey run by the CDC to look at the health and nutrition of people living in the United States. NHANES has been collecting detailed health information every two years since 1999. For this analysis, researchers used data from six survey periods between 2007 and 2020. They focused only on participants aged 20 and older, eliminating those who didn’t have complete dietary or health data, as well as those with extremely high or low BMI or calorie intake. Pregnant participants were also excluded. After applying all these filters, a total of 20,804 participants were included in this study.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Blood pressure levels were measured regularly from 2007 to 2020 by a trained healthcare professional. High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, was defined as having an average systolic blood pressure of 130 or higher, having an average diastolic blood pressure of 80 or higher or being on blood pressure-lowering medication.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The DI-GM used in this study was created using information from NHANES. Participants shared details about what they ate over two separate 24-hour periods, spaced three to 10 days apart, to make sure the data was thorough and accurate. Researchers identified 14 key foods and nutrients that impact gut health, scoring them based on their effects on gut bacteria. If someone ate certain beneficial foods at or above the average for their gender, they earned 1 point; if they consumed too much of less gut-healthy foods, they scored 0 points. The total score ranged from 0 to 13, showing how much a person’s diet supports healthy gut bacteria. A higher score indicates more foods that positively affect gut health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did The Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After adjusting for other factors, DI-GM (a dietary index score capturing certain nutritional patterns) showed a slight protective effect against hypertension, with those in the high DI-GM group having a 13% lower chance compared to the low DI-GM group. Analysis also suggested that this relationship between DI-GM and hypertension is steady and consistent.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; An important detail to note is that this study did not directly measure the &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it looked at how diet patterns, measured using the DI-GM, might reflect gut health. The authors explain that while this method isn’t as precise as directly analyzing the microbiome, it still offers useful insights into how diet may impact gut health and, in turn, blood pressure. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another limitation to note is that the study used data from NHANES, which only provides a snapshot in time, and it's difficult to say for sure if one thing causes another. For now, it would be safer to say that a gut-healthy diet is associated with lower risk of high blood pressure. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plus, the dietary information relied on people’s self-reports, which can sometimes be inaccurate. Additionally, the DI-GM is just an indicator and doesn’t fully capture the complexity of gut microbes. While the results are relevant to U.S. adults, they might not apply to people elsewhere who have different diets or gut health profiles. Future research could build on these findings by using long-term studies and more precise methods to confirm these relationships.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Here are a few approachable diet tips for supporting your gut and overall well-being:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize fiber-rich foods.&lt;/strong&gt; Add more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables to your meals to promote a diverse and healthy gut microbiome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Include fermented foods.&lt;/strong&gt; Yogurt, kimchi, sauerkraut, and kefir are great for increasing probiotics in your diet.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explore plant-based options.&lt;/strong&gt; Swap out some animal-based meals for plant-based alternatives rich in fiber and nutrients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Small, consistent changes like these may make a big difference over time, helping to manage blood pressure and improve your overall health. After all, good health truly starts on your plate.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-our-expert-take"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Our Expert Take &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This new study published in &lt;em&gt;BMJ Nutrition, Prevention, and Health&lt;/em&gt; highlights the intriguing connection between diet, gut health and blood pressure. Researchers found that individuals who ate more gut-friendly foods were less likely to have high blood pressure. Although the study didn’t directly measure the gut microbiome, it underscores the role nutrition plays in fostering a healthy microbiota and, by extension, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/bad-things-you-should-be-doing-for-heart-health-8610881" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;supporting cardiovascular health&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As science continues to uncover the links between what we eat, our gut microbiome and overall health, the message becomes clear: small, intentional dietary changes can lead to meaningful improvements in long-term well-being. Whether it’s adding more fiber-rich foods like fruits and vegetables, incorporating fermented options like yogurt or kimchi, or shifting toward plant-based meals, these steps are accessible and impactful.&lt;br&gt;

The findings suggest that this dietary approach, often associated with weight loss and epilepsy treatment, may also enhance brain function in people without cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under normal dietary conditions, the brain relies heavily on glucose for fuel. However, when carbohydrate intake drops significantly, the body shifts into a metabolic state known as ketosis. In this state, the liver converts fat into ketone bodies—mainly β-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate, and acetone—which can cross the blood-brain barrier and serve as an alternative energy source for the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A ketogenic diet is designed to mimic the effects of fasting by drastically reducing carbohydrate intake and increasing fat consumption. Typically, this type of diet provides around 70–75% of calories from fat, 20% from protein, and only 5–10% from carbohydrates. The goal is to shift the body’s metabolism toward fat oxidation and ketone production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rationale behind the study was based on emerging evidence that ketone bodies might not only serve as a backup fuel source for the brain but could also have direct benefits for brain health. Previous research has shown that individuals with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease often have difficulty using glucose effectively in the brain. Because ketones bypass some of the pathways affected in these conditions, they may help compensate for impaired glucose metabolism and restore energy balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to acting as fuel, ketone bodies may also influence brain signaling pathways, inflammation, and the production of protective proteins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which supports neuron survival and synaptic function. The researchers wanted to find out if these benefits would also apply to cognitively healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test their hypothesis, the scientists conducted a controlled trial involving 11 cognitively healthy adults who were between the ages of 50 and 70 and classified as overweight. Each participant completed two separate three-week dietary periods in a crossover design, meaning they tried both a ketogenic diet and a standard diet in different phases of the study. There was a one-week break between the two phases. The order of diets was randomized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the ketogenic diet phase, participants consumed a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet designed to trigger the production of ketone bodies—molecules the body uses for energy when carbohydrate intake is limited. The diet was composed of approximately 75% fat, 20% protein, and only 5% carbohydrates. Participants were instructed on what to eat and monitored their blood ketone levels twice daily using a flash monitoring device. Those who did not achieve a certain level of ketones in the first week were excluded. During the standard diet phase, participants followed the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations, which emphasize a more conventional balance of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess the impact of each diet, the researchers used a combination of advanced brain imaging techniques. At the end of each diet phase, participants underwent a brain scan using positron emission tomography (PET) to measure blood flow in different regions of the brain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were also performed to help align and interpret the PET data. On the same day as the PET scan, blood samples were collected to measure levels of the ketone molecule β-hydroxybutyrate and the neurotrophic protein BDNF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that the ketogenic diet significantly elevated both ketone levels and brain-related outcomes. After three weeks on the ketogenic diet, participants’ blood levels of β-hydroxybutyrate increased more than twelvefold compared to the standard diet. This biochemical marker confirmed that participants had entered a state of nutritional ketosis. More importantly, cerebral blood flow was 22% higher on average during the ketogenic phase compared to the standard diet. This increase was observed across multiple regions of the brain and was measured with a high level of precision using PET imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to improved blood flow, the researchers found that levels of BDNF were 47% higher during the ketogenic diet phase. BDNF is a protein that plays a key role in the growth, maintenance, and survival of neurons. It is often described as “fertilizer” for the brain and is believed to support learning and memory. Reduced BDNF levels have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. While previous research had shown that ketone supplements could increase BDNF in the short term, this study demonstrated that sustained nutritional ketosis can also elevate BDNF levels over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also found a strong correlation between blood ketone levels and cerebral blood flow across the two diet phases. In other words, higher ketone concentrations in the blood were associated with greater brain perfusion. This relationship adds further weight to the idea that ketone metabolism plays a direct role in improving brain function, even in the absence of cognitive deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the sample size was small—only 11 participants completed the full protocol—the findings were consistent across individuals and backed by rigorous imaging and biochemical assessments. The authors noted that nine participants completed both PET scans, and BDNF data were available for ten participants. Importantly, no serious side effects were reported, and all participants successfully reached and maintained a ketotic state during the ketogenic phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research builds on earlier findings from studies involving people with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease, who often experience decreased cerebral blood flow. In those populations, ketogenic diets or ketone supplements have been associated with improvements in brain energy metabolism and function. However, it was previously unclear whether the same benefits would extend to healthy individuals without signs of cognitive decline. This new study fills that gap by showing that a ketogenic diet can enhance both blood flow and neurotrophic support in people without existing brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low cerebral blood flow has been linked to future cognitive decline in both patients and healthy individuals. Several studies have shown that people with lower blood flow in certain brain areas are more likely to experience memory problems and reduced executive functioning over time. By increasing cerebral perfusion, a ketogenic diet might help protect against such decline, although more research is needed to confirm that possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also highlighted the potential importance of BDNF in brain aging. BDNF helps regulate synaptic plasticity, the ability of the brain to adapt and reorganize itself, which is vital for learning and memory. Lower BDNF levels are commonly observed in people with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. Raising BDNF through diet or other interventions might improve neural resilience and delay the onset of cognitive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the study’s limitations is the small number of participants. While the crossover design helps control for individual variability, a larger sample size would be needed to confirm the generalizability of the results. Another limitation is that the study only included individuals who were overweight, which means the findings might not apply to people of normal weight or those with different metabolic profiles. Additionally, the intervention lasted just three weeks per diet phase. It is not yet known whether these effects would persist or grow stronger with longer-term adherence to a ketogenic diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could explore whether similar improvements in cerebral blood flow and BDNF occur in other populations, such as people at risk of dementia, individuals with metabolic syndrome, or even younger adults. Studies could also examine whether these physiological changes translate into measurable improvements in cognitive performance. Finally, it would be useful to compare different types of ketogenic diets, such as those based on plant-based fats versus animal fats, to assess how various nutritional sources influence brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgaf207" target="_blank"&gt;A 3-Week Ketogenic Diet Increases Global Cerebral Blood Flow and Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Thien Vinh Luong, Kim Vang Hansen, Allan Kjeldsen Hansen, Stephen C.

There are some add-on drugs approved for use alongside insulin, but Shah envisions Ozempic-like drugs as a potential firstline treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34757-insulin-resistance-develop-diabetes-heart-disease.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34757-insulin-resistance-develop-diabetes-heart-disease.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and impaired release of digestive hormones that fuel type 2 diabetes can also exist in type 1, so it does make sense to explore treatments for those, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="type-1-type-2-and-double-diabetes-3"&gt;Type 1, type 2, and double diabetes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are driven by very different mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/40894-type-2-diabetes.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/40894-type-2-diabetes.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;type 2&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, cells in the pancreas that make insulin become less sensitive to blood sugar and produce less insulin in response. Insulin normally helps usher sugar from the bloodstream into cells, so this effect causes sugar to build up in the blood.

Drugs like semaglutide, known as GLP-1 agonists, control blood sugar in type 2 by reducing a liver-made hormone that raises blood sugar, as well as slowing down digestion. This makes you feel fuller for longer and allows the pancreas more time to release the right amount of insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The primary way to control blood sugar in type 1 diabetes, however, is insulin replacement. But type 1 diabetics, especially those with obesity, often have insulin resistance and thus many of the same health issues as those with type 2 — for example, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/diabeticnerveproblems.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/diabeticnerveproblems.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;nerve damage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, foot ulcers and eye damage, all due to uncontrolled blood sugar. This condition has been termed "double diabetes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Type 1 diabetes does not exclude the presence of type 2 diabetes," Shah said. "People with the double diabetes phenotype may benefit from some of the medications that are currently approved for type 2 diabetes."&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;That was the idea behind the new trial of semaglutide, the ingredient found in the weight-loss drug Ozempic and type 2 diabetes drug Wegovy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 72 patients with type 1 diabetes and obesity, based on their &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/bmi-health-weight" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/bmi-health-weight"&gt;&lt;u&gt;BMIs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Half the participants received a weekly semaglutide injection and the other half a placebo for 26 weeks. All the participants continued using insulin as needed throughout the trial, and their blood sugar was monitored using continuous glucose monitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patients taking semaglutide had better control over their blood sugar levels, staying within an acceptable range of blood sugar levels over 70% of the time while also spending less time with low blood sugar levels. The treated individuals also lost at least 5% of their body weight. But no one in the untreated group met all three of these criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results support findings from other &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=livescience_us_2980271291255122265&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41591-024-03463-z&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fmedicine-drugs%2Fozempic-style-drugs-treat-type-1-diabetes-not-only-type-2-study-finds" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03463-z" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1590019&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41591-024-03463-z&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.livescience.com%2Fhealth%2Fmedicine-drugs%2Fozempic-style-drugs-treat-type-1-diabetes-not-only-type-2-study-finds" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="nature.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;recent trials&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, showing that these drugs used for type 2 diabetes are worth exploring in type 1 diabetics, said &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mcgill.ca/expmed/dr-ahmad-haidar" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.mcgill.ca/expmed/dr-ahmad-haidar" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ahmad Haidar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a diabetes researcher at McGill University in Canada, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an important study that adds to the existing evidence toward the safety and efficacy of the use of semaglutide in type 1, but it is not enough," Haidar told Live Science. "We need more evidence to help these drugs be approved by regulatory agencies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shah and his colleagues hope that with more clinical trials with bigger cohorts of patients, the research community will gather enough evidence to have this use of GLP-1s approved by the Food and Drug Administration and added into the American Diabetes Association standards of care for type 1. If approved, the treatments could then potentially be covered by health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And if that happens, I think this would be probably the first drug beyond insulin for people with type 1 diabetes to use," Shah said. "It's really exciting that it's moving forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-gXAJKUoEBdBCz7ETY6KvzU-gzaagZD6w2XRCqGhNjgPCNogxx47Hqjr" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-gXAJKUoEBdBCz7ETY6KvzU-gzaagZD6w2XRCqGhNjgPCNogxx47Hqjr slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      Rice enhances flavor profiles for nonalcoholic beer, reduces fermentation time, and may contribute to flavor stability.

                      &lt;/a&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He and his team—including Christian Schubert, a visiting postdoc from the Research Institute for Raw Materials and Beverage Analysis in Berlin—brewed their own non-alcoholic beers, ranging from those made with 100 percent barley malt to ones made with 100 percent rice. They conducted a volatile chemical analysis to identify specific compounds present in the beers and assembled two sensory panels of tasters (one in the US, one in Europe) to assess aromas, flavors, and mouthfeel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panelists determined the rice-brewed beers had less worty flavors, and the chemical analysis revealed why: lower levels of aldehyde compounds. Instead, other sensory attributes emerged, most notably vanilla or buttery notes. "If a brewer wanted a more neutral character, they could use nonaromatic rice," the authors wrote. Along with brewing beers with 50 percent barley/50 percent rice, this would produce non-alcoholic beers likely to appeal more broadly to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panelists also noted that higher rice content resulted in beers with a fatty/creamy mouthfeel—likely because higher rice content was correlated with increased levels of larger alcohol molecules, which are known to contribute to a pleasant mouthfeel. But it didn't raise the alcohol content above the legal threshold for a nonalcoholic beer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were cultural preferences, however. The US panelists didn't mind worty flavors as much as the European tasters did, which might explain why the former chose beers brewed with 70 percent barley/30 percent rice as the optimal mix. Their European counterparts preferred the opposite ratio (30 percent barley/70 percent rice). The explanation "may lie in the sensory expectations shaped by each region's brewing traditions," the authors wrote. Fermentation also occurred more quickly as the rice content increased because of higher levels of glucose and fructose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second study focused on testing 74 different rice cultivars to determine their extract yields, an important variable when it comes to an efficient brewing process, since higher yields mean brewers can use less grain, thereby cutting costs. This revealed that cultivars with lower amylose content cracked more easily to release sugars during the mashing process, producing the highest yields. And certain varieties also had lower gelatinization temperatures for greater ease of processing.&lt;/p&gt;

What can we learn from them to promote healthier, longer lives?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Guests&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Eric Topol&lt;/strong&gt;, cardiologist, scientist and author. Chair of the Department of Translational Medicine at Scripps Research. Author of: Super Agers: An Evidence-Based Approach to Longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Also Featured&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee Rushall&lt;/strong&gt;, a “super ager.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Transcript&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part I&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;DEBORAH BECKER: Today we're taking up an age-old question about age. Why is it that some people drastically deteriorate in their later years? While others, like 98-year-old Lee Rushall seemingly do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;LEE RUSHALL: I don't think about age myself. I am pretty much doing everything I used to do, except when I look in the mirror, there's an old lady looking back at me and I don't recognize that person too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: Lee is an artist who just had a showing of her paintings in her hometown of San Diego. She has no chronic diseases, a large group of friends, and remains independent and active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;RUSHALL: I also like to do jigsaw puzzles. 1,000 to 1,500 pieces. I knit. I read. I play games. I play cards twice a week and keep myself busy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: Lee says she really doesn't know why she's aged so well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;RUSHALL: My doctor that I used to have, she said I had good genes, but I don't see how that's possible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: Seems impossible, she says, because her parents both died of health-related issues before they were 70. Her brothers passed away decades ago. Lee says she doesn't do anything special to maintain her health, but she does maintain a positive attitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;RUSHALL: I was married for 72.5 years. And we had a wonderful life. Many ups and downs, but many joyous times. And if I can't be in my own home with my husband, I'm glad I'm here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: And Lee Rushall is defying the odds. In the U.S., about 95% of people get some type of chronic disease by the time they reach age 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;How did Lee escape that fate? This hour we're gonna talk with one of her physicians. Dr. Eric Topol is a cardiologist and scientist, he's also author of the new book titled Super Agers: An Evidence-Based Approach to Longevity. Dr. Topol and his team studied more than 1,400 people, likely people he calls super agers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;That's someone who's over 80 and has never had a chronic medical condition. Dr. Eric Topol, welcome to On Point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;ERIC TOPOL: Thank you, Deborah, and great to be with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: So you're one of Lee's doctors, not the one who told her that good genes might be why she's so vibrant at almost 100. Because your book says genes aren't really a big factor as far as we know right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;That's surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: It is surprising. It surprised us when we did that work that you just alluded to, the ['wellderly'] study, but we did whole genome sequences on all 1,400 people and we found little differences in their genomes from the elderly. That is the people over age 65 who do have age related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And the other thing, Deborah, that you mentioned, is that Lee, the patient I present in the book, had all her relatives die at much younger ages, 30, 40 years younger than her. And so that also defies that this is a genetic story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: And your book is full of research. It's terrific. About age, chronic disease, what we know about healthy aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And on the one hand you say, we're witnessing this sort of incomparable time for the life sciences. And we have a blueprint, at least, we're close to a blueprint to help prevent some of the major age-related diseases. And yet you have those statistics, right? 95% of Americans getting a chronic disease by age 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The average American having only one healthy birthday after 65. Those are really sobering numbers. So I wonder, first tell us why we're seeing those kinds of numbers in the U.S., which also has the highest health care costs, and then let's talk about what a super ager is. So we know some of the reasons why chronic disease is such a problem here, but how, what do you say about that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: It's partly because we have not adopted the ways we could prevent these diseases. We've never prevented cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and cancer. We are reactive to those and so that's not gonna help matters, when you don't prevent them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: And we have ways to prevent them, you're saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: Exactly. And as you mentioned, an incomparable time, which is right now, we've never been able to prevent them because we didn't have the tools to do that. But that's completely changed now and we've got to get on it because, as you say, the toll of people with chronic age-related major diseases in those three categories is so profound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And part of it is we have a generally a poor lifestyle and there's many factors I'm sure we'll talk about that contribute. And part of it is our medical community, our bias is not towards prevention. It's much more towards being reactive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: And so how is it that things have changed really to give us these tools to prevent these major age-related diseases?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: Yeah, that's the important thing is that we have new ways to anticipate many years before, one of these age-related diseases occurs. So all three, heart disease, cancer, neurodegenerative, specifically Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, they take 20 years or longer to incubate in our body. So we have a long runway to work with, and we now have proteins, genes, and biomarkers to be able to detect who is at high risk and to get all over those individuals regarding surveillance and prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;So essentially, we didn't have these different ways to detect high risk. We didn't have the AI to process all the data, but we do now. And so we have for the first time, a realistic exceptionally promising way to prevent the big three age related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: And so what would you say then, what do we have to change to be able to do some of these things?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;What's the main thing that we need to do to be able to take some of these preventative steps?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: For example, one of the diseases that most people dread would be Alzheimer's. And we now have a biomarker for Alzheimer's. It's called PT 217. A lot of people don't know about it, but it's been out for a couple years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And there are people who are at high risk because they have Alzheimer's in their family or because they had an APOE 4, which 20 or 25% of the population has that allele. Or they have a polygenic risk that's high for Alzheimer's. So any one of those three or all three of those factors denote possible high risk, but then they could get a P-Tau 217, nail that down, and it's modifiable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;That is exercise, healthy lifestyle brings those, the marker down and would forestall or even prevent the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: So it would really prevent, it was always my understanding that even if you found out you were at risk of some of these things, there really wasn't much you could do about it. So maybe it's better just not to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: Alright, that was the case, Deborah, until now, and that was one of the reasons I wrote the book. Because now things are so different, whereas before, let's say you had a APOE 4 or you had family history, you didn't know when you're going to get Alzheimer's. It just was yes or no risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Now we can say specifically the timing, once you have the marker, that P-Tau 217 or one of the other neuro markers, we can say exactly when you're going to develop what's called MCI cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment, a precursor to Alzheimer's. So we can not only just say yes or no, but we can give a temporal forecast very accurately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: And then what about the others? What about cardiovascular disease and cancer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: Yeah, the same thing. It's a little bit different, because the markers are different, but basically, it's a combination of defining who's at high risk and polygenic risk scores are part of that. So we have one for all of the common cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;So whether it's breast or colon or prostate or any of them, we can define who's at high risk. Again, we can't say when, just sometime in that person's lifetime, they're at high risk. And then basically we would be checking these clocks. That are now soon to be available. Organ clocks. These are also proteins in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;We can assay up to 11,000 of them with a milliliter of blood at low cost. And then we can say, there's one of these organs is aging fast. Faster than all the others in the person, and say that could be a source of potential cancer. So when you combine all these data points, which humans, doctors can't do, we really need help from AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;But when you can process all that, analyze it, you say we're gonna put this person under surveillance for, let's say it's colon cancer, because that's the organ that lights up with respect to pace of aging. We also have body-wide aging clocks. So these are the ways that we can then say someone's at high risk, and we can also do a new blood test called multi-cancer early detection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Which picks up any tumor, DNA, very low quantity, in the blood, long before it would show up on a scan like a MRI. So we have new tools we didn't have before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: But so should people be asking their doctors, can I get my polygenic risk score? Can I get a multi cancer early detection test? If we have these things, they're certainly not widely used, as far as I can tell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;So what should people do to try to see if they can get a window on some of these potential preventative measures?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: Yeah, no I lay that out thoroughly in the book. But I think the key here is that there needs to be public awareness. We're stuck in this ritualistic, like for example, cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;We do mass screening. Based only on age. Whether it's mammography or colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: Colonoscopies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: Yeah. That's so crazy. Because it's not age, that's the risk can be defined. So for example, 88% of women will never in their life develop breast cancer. 88%, but we can define the 12% who are at high risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Why are we putting all women through frequent mammograms, which often have false positives and no less even false negatives, so we can do so much better. And the problem is that the medical community is just stuck. It just needs to reboot on how we do screening for these three major diseases, and we're not doing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part II&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: We asked some of you what you think is the secret to longevity. Here's some of what you told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;FRANKIE: I'm 80 and I'm in perfect health. My doctors can never believe it. Nothing's wrong with me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;MATTHEW: After dealing with my parents in their elder years. I am convinced that genetics has much more to do with longevity than probably just about anything else.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;FRANKIE: I think my Comanche heritage helps, but I only eat organic. I get deathly ill if I eat the chemicals in American food. I was raised on a 1,000-acre farm with no chemicals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;MATTHEW: My mother passed in her mid-eighties and my father is still with us in his nineties, and both are, or were morbidly obese. They really had their health declined after their mid-forties, yet they persisted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;JON: I believe the secret to longevity is to enjoy life. When I was a motivational speaker, my tagline was, if you're not having fun, you're doing it wrong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: Those were On Point listeners, Frankie in North Carolina, Matthew in Pennsylvania, and Jon in Georgia. Today, Dr. Eric Topol is with us. Dr. Topol, what do you think when you hear those listener responses about longevity?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: It is very interesting, Deborah. Everybody has a theory. I think the data supports that the predominant reason people have this healthy aging pattern is because their immune system is so intact. And it's the immune, it's immunosenescence. As we get older, our immune system loses its protection, gets dysregulated, that is, can overreact, and also inflammation that's tied into that, because that drives the inflammation, inflammaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And so that's what sets up these age-related major diseases. And so lifestyle like the one mentioned, obesity that promotes inflammation. And things like an exercise program, decreases inflammation and improves the immune system function. So there's a model here where almost all that we know, all the different factors work through this immune system inflammation story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: And so let's talk about some of those things, some of the things people can do. We talked about what the medical system should do in terms of perhaps testing and outlining potential preventative steps, right? But what about what people can do to perhaps improve their immune systems, sleep, exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;So let's tick off some of them. Sleep first, recommended hours per night. What would you say, Dr. Topol?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: Surprisingly, the data comes in at seven hours, not eight, where most people think, but of course, that's at the population level, individuals will vary optimal sleep. The best way to determine one's optimal sleep is actually to track it for a stretch, a couple weeks or a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Ideally, that can be done with fitness bands or with rings or mattress sensors. But the point is deep sleep. Which is the slow way, sleep typically occurring early in the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;That's the precious deep sleep that we lose a lot of while as we age, and it's during deep sleep where the brain clears its waste products, its toxic metabolites, that accumulate each day, and they go through this channel, these micro channels called glymphatics, as opposed to lymphatics. And so if you don't get enough deep sleep, you're not clearing these metabolites that are inflammatory to the brain, which sets up the problem of higher risk of Alzheimer's. And other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Deep sleep is essential, and a lot of people don't know whether they have adequate, particularly as they get older. So it's not just quantity, it's quality. And one last thing is about regularity. We didn't realize how important that is until recent times, but going to bed, particularly earlier than most people might assume, and being on a regular pattern, our body wants to be in a circadian rhythm, and we defy that so frequently, but sleep regularity is tied into cardiovascular, cancer and neurodegenerative age-related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: Okay. Now let's take up exercise next. Sleep, we need it. We need to be consistent about it. We also need to be consistent about exercise. You mentioned that in particular, when it comes to inflammation and boosting the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;So 10,000 steps we've heard about over and over again, that this is the thing we need to do. But in your book, you say not necessarily. How come?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: That 10,000 step number was never validated. There have been lots of studies Deborah, on steps in the quantity, even at 4,000 steps. And we're not talking about walking around the house; we're talking about a dedicated walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;That is a beginning to show substantial benefit. And of course, the more walking, the more steps, there's also proportionate benefit, but it isn't just steps or whether that's aerobic exercise from bicycling or treadmill or other activities, jogging. The other part is that we need to have balance training and resistance training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And turns out, particularly resistance training is just as important as aerobic. To get a few sessions, a week of a half hour of resistance training is really vital, because that correlates and is an essential part of keeping our immune system intact with the prevention of these three age related diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: And you say that was something that was new to you, you used to recommend just aerobic exercise. And you didn't really focus on the resistance and strength and balance training, but you've changed. Do you think most cardiologists have changed their opinion, or is there still this focus on aerobic without emphasizing the balance training and things like that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: I think the aerobic emphasis is still there. And I think some of the younger cardiologists have figured this out. But no, I think the new data that's going to be really come about in the last few years is really compelling. So I think eventually, all cardiologists would revise their recommendations. I used to see these patients, I still do, who come in with incredibly buffed and working out with lifting weights. And I would say, don't do that. Work on aerobics. Now I can say, it's okay if you do that, but you sure don't want to miss aerobics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;So it's a whole different type of position now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: One thing I found really interesting in the book, you talk about balance and grip. And what that says about your health. Can you tell our listeners that and what is a good kind of standard exercise that someone could easily do to improve balance or test their balance?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: Yeah, our balance, the fancy term proprioception is really compromised as we get older. So it's so important that people as they get past 65, 70, work on balance, standing on one leg, one foot for at least a minute. You want to work towards that. And then when you get to that point, when you're on each, then you start to do touchdowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Touching below your shins, on one leg, or you can do it on a foam pad and make it even more challenging. But this exercise of balance is so important because it does improve not just your brain proprioception, but it also helps to prevent falls and falls are a critical problem in people of advanced age, and we want to prevent those for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: And what about grip? Because I found that very fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: The grip is fascinating, and the stronger your hand grip is, the better longevity and health span, you're gonna likely experience the problem with hand grip it probably isn't just the hand grip, it's a reflection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Since we don't have other ways to measure upper body strength. Or total body strength. The hand grip is a very convenient way to get a window into that. So yeah, I think this is important. A lot of people haven't realized how important strength is with respect to promoting health span.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: Okay let's wade into diet, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Because that's always a big factor here. And many folks think if they just eat right, they're going to be okay. So let's start with plant-based eating. Many folks are have gone to plant-based eating. They know it's better for them, it's better for the environment. Yes. Should people do that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Is that a key here, Dr. Topol?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: Yes. Plant-based eating diets are anti-inflammatory. And so every study, randomized trials, a recent large study of 105,000 people followed for 30 years, only 9% got to healthy aging at age 70. And what did they eat?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;A plant, predominantly plant-based diet. The Mediterranean diet, of course, would include not just plants, certainly, salmon, seafood. But emphasizing fruits and vegetables. And so it's fine to have occasional red meat and things that we know are pro-inflammatory, but they shouldn't be a core part of a person's diet, because they're pushing the body wide inflammation in the wrong direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: And then there's the protein issue, right? Which folks bring up when somebody is on a plant-based diet and getting enough of, but there's a lot of debate about what is enough, right? So I wonder, what does the research tell us about how much protein people should have every day?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: There's a craze right now on protein and it's unfounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;It isn't based on data. Some call it bro science, but the problem we have is that the recommendation in the country generally around the world is 0.8 grams per kilogram per day. So a body weight, so that can be upward 1, 1.2, even a little bit more than that, per gram of grams per kilogram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;That's a very good amount of protein. The problem is we have some people recommending one gram per pound. Okay. I'm 180 pounds, to get 180 grams of protein every day. That's crazy, right? So it turns out the studies show that if you have too much protein, that you are getting pro-inflammatory, the last thing you want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And experimental studies show that it promotes atherosclerosis. That's another thing we don't want. So you don't want to overdose protein, but you do want to, as you get older, because there's muscle mass loss, a small increase in protein from the recommended allowances is quite reasonable. The other thing is, if you're going to get extra protein, you don't really want to get that from animal-based protein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Plant-based protein is a better source because it's almost, it's characteristically anti-inflammatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: A lot of us know this. We do know that plant-based diets are better. We do know we should exercise. And as you point out in the book, I think. what, just about a quarter, maybe slightly more than a quarter of Americans actually do exercise regularly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;So what do you do to try to tell people and make sure that this message gets across?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: Yeah, this is something that we know doesn't work. That is when you tell all people they should follow all these things, we have a limited success. And that's why as we were discussing earlier, when you know specific risk, and you know that lifestyle will help that specific risk, whether it's for Alzheimer's, for heart disease, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;That's when you see a much better uptake of these lifestyle factors being incorporated in a person's daily life, because they're motivated, they know it's about them, and they're not taking population wide recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: You also mentioned personalized nutrition. Why is that something we should think about?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: That's something that's under study. There's a big NIH program if it doesn't get cut that's looking into that, right? 10,000 people. But basically, because each of us are unique, including our metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And when it's been looked at, the same amount of food, the same amount of time, by different people, a very different response to glucose and lipids and everything. So the question is, can we be able to match up what are the best foods either to eat or to avoid by using all the data. And of course, again, AI, because it's a lot of data in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Because again, we don't know that this one diet that's recommended for all people is the right diet for everyone. It's unlikely it is. So we're going to see over the years ahead whether this personalized diet will get legs. Right now, it's a research entity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: And so I wonder, your book also mentions environmental toxins, which, we know perhaps we can exercise more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Maybe if it is targeted to us and you say that these exercises will definitely help, because you're at risk of this specific disease. Maybe it would inspire people to exercise more and to eat better and to do the things that most of us know we should be doing anyway. But I wonder, in terms of environmental toxins, is there much we can do really about these. And can you talk a little bit more in depth about how these are affecting our health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: Yeah. The big three are air pollution, and that one of course is hard to do a lot. But of course, if you have air filtration, better air quality, whether it's at home or work, that's gonna help a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Then the next is the microplastics, nanoplastics, right? That's a really big story because it's pervasive in air and water, so we're ingesting it all the time and we know that, for example, it can increase when it gets in the artery wall, increase the risk of heart attacks gets into the brain, it appears to increase the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And there are certain things people can do to reduce the burden of microplastics like plastic bottles to avoid for water and not to have food in plastic storage, not to microwave anything in plastic, that's going to make it much worse, using wood, utensils or metal rather than plastic utensils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;So plastic is a real burden that we can do small amounts each of us individually, but we also need to tackle the much bigger problem, which is start getting these degraded. Because they're just accumulating mega tons on an almost daily basis and nothing is being done to prevent that. The third one that's really a big issue is these forever chemicals, which are also pervasive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: PFAS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: Yeah, and here again, yes. PFAS, exactly. These chemicals get in our body. They're not helping, between PFAS and microplastics. It's possible they may account for problems with fertility because they get, they affect our reproductive system, and they also affect, they're pro-inflammatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;So they increase the risk of age-related diseases, the topic of today. We could reign those in, but we have to deal with the companies that are largely responsible for them. And that's been the basic unwillingness, Deborah, is that we're not taking on, whether it's big food for ultra process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And constituents of our diet, if we're not taking on the plastics problem or the PFAS, forever chemicals, we're just letting it just get worse and worse, and we need health policy changes in order to address these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part III&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: Today we're talking about super agers. Those are people who live well into their 80s without getting chronic diseases. With us is Dr. Eric Topol, who has studied this group and studied healthy aging, which is a topic that's extremely popular right now with some incredible claims about longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;BRIAN JOHNSON: Three years ago, I asked the most unthinkable and crazy question possible. Are we the first generation that won't die?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: That's Brian Johnson, a tech entrepreneur on his YouTube channel. Back in January, a Netflix documentary outlined some of his attempts to slow the aging process. He spends about $2 million a year on biohacking medical procedures, on supplements and longevity consultants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And Johnson often speaks about and sells components of his daily routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;JOHNSON: I'll then apply a hair serum, massage my scalp for one to two minutes, and wear a red light hair cap for six minutes. I'll do a breathing exercise or meditation for five minutes to get my mind and body set for the day. Then I'll consume an eight-ounce drink consisting of blueprint longevity mix, collagen peptides, creatine, and some prebiotics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: I am here with Dr. Eric Topol. He's the author of the book, Super Agers: An Evidence-Based Approach to Longevity. Dr. Topol, what do you think is happening in terms of this kind of marketing and different ways to boost longevity?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: Yeah, this is so important, Deborah. This is maybe the principle reason I felt I had to write this book because there's so much pseudoscience out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;False claims, there are longevity companies that are charging up to $250,000 for a person to come and have plasmapheresis, which is one of the things that Brian Johnson, who's an extremist, has had and advocated, from his blood from his teenage son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;There are hyperbaric chambers and stem cells, and they're hawking all these supplements that have no basis of any data, any evidence, just like you heard from directly from Brian Johnson there, it's just all over the place. In the book I called it a circus, and it's just, it's a jungle. There's no regulation. Claims that are being made all over the place and people are falling for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Because it's a predatory thing where people do want to have a longer, healthier life, and they think that being a customer of these longevity companies, that they're gonna somehow get that. Some of them are just marketing longevity and they're doing things like getting hundreds of blood tests, getting a total body MRI, nothing that is supported by any evidence, which is, it's outrageous. It's very frustrating, because so many people are falling for this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And the number of people who are taking these putative anti-aging supplements is just extraordinary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: So we'll talk about some of those in a minute, but I guess what's, do you have an overarching piece of advice to folks to cut through some of this marketing and try to figure out what might help them aside from the basics of sleep, diet and exercise. What do you tell folks?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: What you just mentioned, sleep, diet, and exercise. They're basically free or very low cost, and they'll get you, that's where the evidence lies. That's where the big bang is for little bucks. Exercise is free, as best I can see, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;That's one thing. The second is, there are a lot of these influencers out there on longevity, who also are entrepreneurs. They have companies, they're hawking supplements. Be very wary of those, because if they're doing that, they have no data to support what they're selling, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And so that's a real problem. And I think that we should really be careful about supporting and in fact, it's really important to review the evidence firsthand. For example, in super agers, I put in 1,800 citations to back up the data where it exists or where it doesn't exist, especially too. People need to, before they get involved with procedures. Whether it's an MRI or whether it's a plasmapheresis or you name it, or take supplements, they should review the data because it usually doesn't exist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: So no supplements. You mentioned, we've heard a lot about NAD supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Senolytic supplements, that claim to help the body clear out senescent cells. There's research that does show that senescent cells contribute to age-related decline. So you might think that's a viable supplement. Maybe you should take that. But you said how, really, it's a difficult, it's a difficult field to walk into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: Let's just talk about, there's no data for the NAD+ supplements or for rapamycin, a drug that could markedly suppress your immune system. And we have no way to measure whether you're getting even from a low dose of suppression. But then, the whole idea of that you're taking a senolytic, which is supposedly eradicating these bad senescent cells from your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;It turns out we don't have any smart senolytic drugs, they can take out the good senescent cells that are very important for healing and preventing cancer. So we don't have, we don't have the tools. We have some really great science of aging, which has brought us these organ clocks, body wide clocks, biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;But we also have these companies that are doing a great job trying to reverse aging. To find smart senolytics, to do cellular reprogramming, to use stem cells. Various things that are being done in companies that are startups. Most of them are funded by the billionaires who, when they were young, they wanted to be rich, and now that they're rich, they want to be young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: (LAUGHS)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: There's some good stuff going on out there. I don't wanna discount that at all, Deborah. But that's not the stuff that's being marketed to the public. Those are companies that are doing things, most of 'em in animal models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And eventually they'll go to clinical trials. They're not marketing that stuff because they're doing some serious work to try to come up with a reverse aging strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: And one of the things that you mentioned in the book, you say it's the most life-changing, one of the most life-changing medicines in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;GLP-1s, right? Ozempic And Wegovy. That's some of the things that are on the market right now. Also, I would say, being marketed in certain ways that may be questionable, but for the most part, if you're getting it from a doctor, tell us a little bit about why you think this is so life changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Is it the treatment of obesity in general in diabetes or what's going on here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: Yeah, so first, to be clear, I've never been a pro pharma person. I took on Merck many years ago and many other pharma companies. So when I'm saying that this is the most impressive drug class in the history of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The glucagon-like peptides, GLP-1, that's, for me, that's a big deal. It turns out their mechanism of having this broad benefit that goes well beyond diabetes and obesity, heart disease, liver disease, kidney disease, recently migraine headaches, the list is on and on to addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: Parkinson's, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: Maybe three small trials for Parkinson's, ongoing trials for Alzheimer's, addiction, gambling, nicotine, nail biting. The diverse benefits here are related to marked reduction of inflammation in the body and in the brain. And what we're seeing here isn't just Ozempic or Zepbound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;What we're seeing is gut hormones. We didn't know how important they were. They talked to the brain. And they also talk to the immune system, and we're going to see a lot more of these. They're going to be in pill form, they're going to be triple receptors and all sorts of other gut hormones. There's 15 of them that are going to get mimicked, with pills eventually and combinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;So we're at the early time of a gut hormone revolution in medicine, who would ever have guessed that gut hormones could have so much impact. And so it's possible as we go forward in time, this is helping the prevention story to emphasize, because these gut hormones are going to help age related diseases to prevent them, because as we mentioned, inflammation is at the core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;An intact immune system is pivotal and these promote that. So that's one of the reasons I'm so keen that we're gonna be able to prevent diseases so much better in the future. Not just lifestyle factors, but drugs in this family and related anti-inflammatory, pro immune system medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: It's a lot of skepticism about big pharma. As you mentioned, you yourself was big skeptic. Do we know enough about the potential side effects of GLP-1s though?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: As I point out in the book, this over 20 years of experience, it's actually approaching 25 years. And now we have 12% of Americans taking one of these drugs, which is pretty startling, since the obesity indications have only been recent, and a lot of people have to pay out of pocket outrageous amounts per month to get these, because they're not covered by insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;But we don't have any, besides some muscle mass loss, which can be countered largely through resistance training. We don't know of any serious, relatively common adverse effects. There's still things that are out there dangling, but most of the things that we were concerned about, pancreatitis gallbladder issues, many things in the digestive tract. Because that's really predominantly a lot of their action, have not panned out to be significant risk. So we'll going to continue to follow that. Never think that you're gonna get all this benefit without some increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;The main risk though, which is fascinating, is the GI side effects in the first few weeks. This is a unique class of medicines, because after those first few weeks, the side effects largely go away. But the benefits don't, and we don't usually see that with medications. Usually, they track together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: One of the things you mentioned is an obstacle to all of this, right? To really, we may be really on the cusp of something big here in terms of dealing with healthy aging, but we've got some obstacles and one of them is equity, right? So what you're talking about really today is largely for people who can afford the time, right? And the money for good health care and to be able to take care of themselves and to be able to get good food into medicine and ask their doctors for the appropriate tests and all of that. How do we deal with that huge issue of equity?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: I address that as well because I share a deep concern that the people who would benefit most from the things we discussed today are the ones least likely to access them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;So we have to go out of our way to, with deliberate intent to get the people who need this the most, to get access. So we have problems, as you well know, with food deserts throughout the country. And we want to promote healthy diet. We aren't doing a good enough job as physicians regarding mapping out exercise efforts for patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;That requires taking time to go through what it would take, even if it's the weekend warrior, which we've learned is a great way to promote physical activity. We used to fear that, but now it's shown to be quite useful. But you have to really go into the details with each patient about how, when, what can they do, how can they do it at no cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;And these are the sorts of things that the medical community must do much better with patients. And certainly sleep. That's a big one that we know has a huge impact. And that's something that, again, it doesn't take much to get better sleep. People have to learn about that, learn about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;But these are some of the basic core ways, beyond social engagement, getting out in nature, that we can try to work with all people, that they are not costly things. That's not like getting plasmapheresis or a total body MRI, right? And eventually the GLP drugs that we talked about are gonna be very low cost because there'll be pills and generics and all kinds of competition that's gonna be spawned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;So if that class materializes, as we think it will, that's not going to be a barrier eventually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: But in an increasingly stressed health care system. How long do you think it might take for this, it isn't even possible for this to become a routine part of medicine where a doctor is really going to try to personalize things and break it down for people to make sure as many people can take advantage of this as possible?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: That's unfortunately the U.S. system, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;But if you look at other countries, I spent time advising the UK for the National Health system, NHS. And they have a different bent here, because they're trying to prevent diseases in their whole population. And there are many countries like that have the interest at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;We, unfortunately, we have a very fragmented system that doesn't really emphasize prevention. But that's the ultimate economic windfall benefit is you prevent these diseases. That trying to treat someone with Alzheimer's or serious heart disease, heart failure, or cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;This is where we spend all of our health care dollars. So if we got serious about this. We could do it here, but our system isn't as well set up as many other industrialized nations. I think it's imperative that we do this and this whole talk about make America healthy again. If we were serious about it, this is what we'd be doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;BECKER: I wanna go back to the start of the show in the last minute here. So we've got super agers, we've got some of them. These are people who are living into their 80s. They're not sick. They seem to be doing really well, and it looks like it's really good immune system, right? Little inflammation and it's being active and doing some of the common sense things that all of us know we should be doing to stay healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;Is that what you say is why some people seem to age better than others and what do you want to leave folks with as the key way to stay healthy longer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;TOPOL: I do agree. Just as you summarize Deborah, that's the key. We need to flip the illderly. Which is what most people past 60, 65 are, with chronic age-related diseases to the wellderly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;We can do this now. That's what's exciting. And people as we get older, we need to know what our risks are, so we can hone in on that. And have a much higher rate of adoption of these healthy lifestyles, which have expanded, but also get into prevent mode. That is surveillance, whether it's for cancer, whether it's for neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;So use the tools that we have now. That is something, it's amazing. You mentioned it earlier, how long we take to adopt a new way in medicine, takes much too long.

She grew up in rural Missouri, and lived through the Spanish Flu Pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As a child, she survived the mumps, measles, and whooping cough, said a representative for Waltonwood Carriage Park. Most recently, she survived COVID-19 in 2020, making her one of the oldest known survivors of the disease, according to the research group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Gibson married Kenneth Gibson, her high school sweetheart, in April 1930 in Oregon, Missouri; the pair married during the Great Depression. The couple lived on a farm at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"We had chickens and a huge garden and all kinds of fruit trees,” Gibson told &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/detroit/news/metro-detroit-woman-recalls-112-years-of-life/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|⚑u" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;CBS Detroit&lt;/a&gt; in July 2023. “We had plenty to eat. We just didn't have any money to spend.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;They eventually moved to Idaho, where her husband’s relative had a farm. The move is what introduced them to the potato industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"He said Kenny can help me in the field and you can be the cook,” Gibson told CBS Detroit. “I hadn't cooked a thing in my life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;After seven years of marriage, the pair had a son, Kenneth Richard, in January 1937. After that, the couple moved to Newdale, Idaho and later, Idaho Falls as her husband worked as a potato farmer. He later worked as a potato broker until he retired in 1977.

She also has three grandchildren, six great-grandchildren, and 16 great-grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Today, she loves reading and cards, watching “Price is Right” each day, and catching up with her friends at Waltonwood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/01/USAT/84432644007-image-3.jpeg?width=660&amp;amp;height=495&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/07/01/USAT/84432644007-image-3.jpeg?width=1320&amp;amp;height=990&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Bonita Gibson at her 113th birthday party on July 4, 2024."&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Bonita Gibson at her 113th birthday party on July 4, 2024." data-c-credit="Waltonwood Senior Living"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;This year, she plans to celebrate her birthday by participating in the downtown Plymouth Fourth of July Parade.

'It was so insane, just insane. I felt like I was being punished for doing the right thing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nguyen, who is from Vietnam and is studying public health in the US, added, 'In my country, the measles vaccine is free, and I thought it would be the same in the US, because this is a developed country.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family lives in Galveston, where officials have urged people to be 'vigilant' for new cases. A total of 753 people have been diagnosed with measles in Texas so far this year, in America's largest outbreak in two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Thang Nguyen revealed how his family was charged $1,400 for a measles vaccine after he got the second dose for his 4-year-old son Anh Hoang (both are pictured above)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The country has also seen its first measles deaths in a decade, after two children - 6 and 8 years old - died from the infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nguyen now says that, following the high cost of the vaccination, his family is considering flying back to Vietnam for any future inoculations, with a round-trip ticket costing about $1,000 per person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We can take advantage of being with my family and still get the children protected with the vaccines, and not feel uncomfortable about the price,' he said of the potential travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Measles is particularly dangerous for children under 5 years old, with one in five unvaccinated children being hospitalized, one in 20 developing pneumonia and one to three in 1,000 dying from the disease, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To slash this risk, the US recommends two doses of the measles vaccine, with the first administered between 12 and 15 months and the second between four and six years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The shots are generally free via health insurance or state plans in the US, but&lt;span&gt; in some cases, inoculation claims can fall through the cracks and patients wind up with hefty bills.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nguyen brought his family to the US for his public health studies, and he makes less than $57,000 a year as a researcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He has health insurance through his job, but can't afford paying $615 a month to extend his coverage to his wife and three children. His other two children are already vaccinated against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, the family signed up for a plan with insurance broker TaiAn, administered by the International Medical Group. This cost $1,841 for the year, but, unbeknownst to the family, does not cover routine vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At $1,400 for one dose of the measles vaccine, this was more than five times the CDC's estimated cost from private insurers at $278.16 and seven-and-a-half times the $186.55 the agency says the injection should cost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nguyen (second from right) is pictured above with his two 11-year-old daughters (far right and center), wife (second from left) and son (far left). The family moved to the US from Vietnam while Nguyen completes his public health studies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Prescription website GoodRx suggests that, in the area, the vaccine should cost between $285 and $326.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is unclear why the family was charged so much for the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Neither the insurer nor UTMB clinic responded to the Daily Mail's requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the bill for his son's appointment, Nguyen was &lt;span&gt;also charged $313 for the DTaP vaccine and $161 to administer it, as well as $35 for the flu vaccine and $378 to 'evaluate the patient.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nguyen said that as a public health researcher he had no concerns over getting the vaccine and was eager to protect his children.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But he warned that the monumental cost of the vaccine at some hospitals could be driving people away from getting inoculated - which could further fuel the measles outbreak.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Measles vaccination uptake declined in eight out of every 10 US counties last year, a study warned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In Texas, an estimated 94.3 percent of kindergarteners are vaccinated against measles - below the 95 percent needed to prevent an outbreak. In some counties, however, particularly in the Texas panhandle, the vaccination rate falls as low as 66.67 percent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;'I talk to people here and they say, "Yes, it is quite believable that this could happen,"' he told the Mail of the surprise bills. 'But I am in shock, this was the very first time I took my family to a healthcare clinic here.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;He initially disputed the bill with UTMB, which applied a 50 percent discount - normally offered to those with no health insurance - but that still left him with a $1,266 price for his son's appointment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Nguyen then contacted &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/bill-of-the-month-texas-measles-vaccine-insurance-charge-outbreak-international/?utm_campaign=morning_rounds&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9Mu_2CmNUknGAGvJw5hKDijsTqHIyqNYc_hWKZPEVltRb1GxWmIeSogU9hZK-x_Gf1tdcXHGIzZsrQ2TJ538kae4bXPqinfIeXb_C5E10jZdzXfpQ&amp;amp;_hsmi=369288058&amp;amp;utm_content=369288058&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;KFF News&lt;/a&gt;, who also reached out to UTMB.

Fans of the so-called fart walk—a short stroll taken up to about an hour after eating a meal—claim it aids digestion and relieves GI symptoms like gas and bloating. But what do doctors think?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;New name, old concept&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Feeling bloated after a meal is common,” says Dr. David D. Clarke, a clinical assistant professor of gastroenterology emeritus at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University and president of the Association of the Treatment of Neuroplastic Symptoms. That’s because people eat too much, or they eat too quickly and swallow excess air, or they drink beverages with dissolved gas in them like soda or beer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To counter symptoms like these and help relieve gas naturally, walking after dinner can help, doctors agree. Walking can enhance the muscle contractions of the gastrointestinal tract—a wave-like movement called peristalsis—which can help pass the gas as belches or flatulence, explains Clarke. Research has also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9325803/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:long supported;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;long supported&lt;/a&gt; taking a postprandial walk for a different reason: it helps reduce blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The varied benefits of a fart walk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is one social media trend physicians can get behind. A fart walk helps relieve symptoms of bloating and gas and promotes motility of the bowels, says Dr. Shawn Khodadadian of Manhattan Gastroenterology in New York City. Clarke agrees; mild-to-moderate exercise, such as walking, helps the stomach empty more quickly, improving transit through the intestinal tract and clearing out gas and waste through the digestive system, all of which can help alleviate issues like bloating and constipation, he says. “Walking promotes muscle contractions in the stomach and intestines that can lead to belching and farting,” he says. That quicker emptying will also “decrease the time that acid is present in the stomach,” which relieves heartburn in most people, Clarke says. (However, some people with poor tone in the sphincter muscle—at the junction of the esophagus and stomach—might experience more acid reflux when stomach contractions are stimulated by walking, he warns.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read More&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://time.com/7269178/what-is-sleepmaxxing-sleep-doctors/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:What Doctors Really Think of Sleepmaxxing;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What Doctors Really Think of Sleepmaxxing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fart walking may be particularly beneficial for those with medical conditions like &lt;a href="https://time.com/7020813/do-i-have-ibs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:irritable bowel syndrome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;irritable bowel syndrome&lt;/a&gt; (IBS) and &lt;a href="https://time.com/5023122/eating-fast-obesity/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:metabolic syndrome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt;. “There have been studies that show that mobility in general can lead to decreased sensation of gas and bloating in patients with IBS symptoms,” says Khodadadian. Plus, a post-meal stroll’s ability to  better regulate blood sugar is especially helpful for people with metabolic syndrome, he says. &lt;a href="https://time.com/6975058/backward-walking-health-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Short walks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Short walks&lt;/a&gt; after eating can also benefit the heart: helping to &lt;a href="https://time.com/4853121/muscle-weight-fat/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:stave off weight gain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;stave off weight gain&lt;/a&gt;, improve circulation, lower blood pressure, support overall cardiovascular fitness, says Khodadadian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other perks of fart walking might include reducing the risk of diabetes, Clarke says. “Walking after a meal facilitates removal of blood sugar by the muscles and thereby reduces the need for insulin secretion by the pancreas,” Clarke says, which may reduce the risk for the future development of diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A postprandial amble can also brighten your mood. “The addition of aerobic exercise has been shown to improve stress, anxiety, and mild depression,” says Khodadadian. “This can happen by reducing baseline &lt;a href="https://time.com/7267244/cortisol-levels-hormones-throughout-the-day/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cortisol levels;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cortisol levels&lt;/a&gt; over time, by improving sleep quality, and by increasing levels of chemicals such as endorphins, dopamine and serotonin in the body.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to get the most out of your fart walk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fart walks don’t have to be long to be effective. Aim for at least four to five minutes of light-to-moderate paced walking within about an hour of finishing a meal. (More is better: for more sustained GI benefits, shoot for 30–60 minutes of moderate-paced walking on most days of the week, Clarke says.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is generally healthy for everyone, and it should not be strenuous—but if you have had recent surgery, motility issues, abdominal distress, arthritis, or heart or lung issues, you should check with your doctor first before proceeding, adds Khodadadian. Based on your medical history, recommendations may vary for precisely how long you walk, he says, but the goal is ultimately to be able to engage in an appropriate level of exercise—including fart walking—for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact us&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;a href="mailto:letters@time.com?subject=(READER%20FEEDBACK)%20Is%20Taking%20a%20'Fart%20Walk'%20Good%20for%20Your%20Health?&amp;amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F7299648%2Fwhat-is-fart-walk%2F" data-ylk="slk:letters@time.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;letters@time.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 18:29:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFBkX0ZWVFdTaDk4ZlljbTN1eWdoVGluWW81ZUp6aWZZeGRYZ0J4eXVfRWxhRVRneV9icVR3SURMWkVEVzJaRDFFdlR4blY5ZjI2SjBaWkdzaUNiX1Z2c25tOV9VTWI3SnFvblk0b3V1V2g</guid></item><item><title>自闭症的创造力可能源于多动症的共同发生，而不是自闭症本身- PsyPost | Creativity in autism may stem from co-occurring ADHD, not autism itself - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxNWXVGWFltOXJGcVVDRmtDNjh0RVJUaWV5M0x6TmM2T3FGZ081Tks4dGJSTHFBU1FJb3d1SDZ2TTBNZGZnZmdBWm1sWE94eHRYOFFIMmhOS2VTajU0OF9YV3pibzZPdm45eUpQeFhzUkM5Q3FlWWdmN2Q4UnV2eXlMMElYdFVsbERPMHQ3aHlvQ1dSdUZueWZQS0sybw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, creativity has been celebrated as a possible strength in people with autism. From anecdotal reports of autistic savants to growing calls for strength-based education and employment programs, the idea that autism is linked to enhanced creativity has gained traction in research and popular media alike. But a new study published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/abn0000910" target="_blank"&gt;Journal of Psychopathology and Clinical Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; challenges this assumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After controlling for cognitive ability and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, the researchers found that autistic adults did not differ from nonautistic adults in their ability to generate novel ideas. Where differences in creative accomplishments and behaviors did appear, they were better explained by co-occurring ADHD than by autism itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study was designed to address gaps in previous research on creativity in autism. While earlier studies had hinted at a possible connection, most were based on small samples or on measures of autistic traits in the general population rather than on clinically diagnosed individuals. Some had found that people with more autistic traits came up with more original ideas in lab-based tasks, while others reported no such link. But few had examined creativity in autistic adults directly, and none had investigated how other factors—especially ADHD, which frequently co-occurs with autism and has also been linked to creativity—might account for observed differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To provide a more complete picture, the researchers recruited 352 adults in the United Kingdom, half of whom reported having a clinical autism diagnosis. The groups were closely matched on age, sex, and general cognitive ability, ensuring that any differences in creativity would not be explained by these variables. The study used a mix of performance-based and self-report measures to capture different aspects of creativity, including the ability to generate ideas, actual accomplishments, everyday behaviors, personality traits, and self-beliefs about being creative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed a well-established divergent thinking task, which asked them to list as many alternative uses for a brick as possible within two minutes. This task is commonly used in psychological research to assess how fluently and flexibly a person can come up with ideas and how original those ideas are. The researchers also measured real-world creativity using self-report tools, including a questionnaire on specific achievements across domains like art, music, and writing; a checklist of creative behaviors over the past year; and scales measuring creative personality and self-efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were clear: autistic and nonautistic participants performed similarly on the divergent thinking task. They came up with roughly the same number of ideas, showed similar flexibility in the kinds of ideas they produced, and scored similarly on originality. This finding runs counter to the idea that autism is associated with greater creative thinking in lab-based tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, autistic participants did report higher levels of real-world creativity. They indicated more creative accomplishments, such as producing artwork or writing stories, and more engagement in everyday creative behaviors compared to their nonautistic peers. But when the researchers took a closer look, they found something important: these differences disappeared when ADHD was factored in. In other words, the elevated creativity reported by autistic individuals could be explained by whether or not they also had ADHD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used both categorical and dimensional approaches to examine this relationship. They ran statistical models that considered whether a participant had a clinical ADHD diagnosis and also looked at continuous measures of ADHD traits. In both types of analyses, ADHD—but not autism—was consistently associated with higher creative output, both in terms of reported accomplishments and behaviors. Autism alone did not predict enhanced creativity, and in some cases, it was even linked to slightly lower creative personality and self-efficacy scores when traits were measured continuously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings carry significant implications for how creativity is understood and discussed in relation to autism. While it’s possible that some autistic individuals may show creativity in specific areas, this does not appear to be a general feature of autism itself. Instead, it may be more accurate to describe creativity as a strength linked to ADHD—a condition that often co-occurs with autism—rather than as an intrinsic trait of autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also highlighted some potential reasons why previous studies may have produced conflicting or inconclusive results. Many earlier studies did not account for general cognitive ability, which is known to influence creativity. Others may have overlooked the role of ADHD, which can boost creativity through traits like impulsivity, reward sensitivity, and flexible thinking. Because ADHD is underdiagnosed, especially in adults and in those who also have autism, it’s likely that some participants in earlier studies had undetected ADHD that skewed the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although autistic participants reported more creative behaviors and achievements, they did not rate themselves as having higher creative self-efficacy—that is, they did not express stronger beliefs in their own creative abilities. This could suggest a disconnect between actual creative output and how autistic individuals perceive themselves. The authors speculated that this may reflect broader difficulties with self-assessment and self-esteem that are common in autism, pointing to the potential value of interventions that help neurodivergent individuals recognize and build confidence in their strengths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also emphasizes the need for more nuanced and individualized approaches to supporting strengths in neurodivergent populations. It cautions against broadly applying the idea of “autistic creativity” in clinical or educational settings without strong evidence. If creative strengths are only present in autistic individuals who also have ADHD, then programs designed to support creativity in autism should consider this variability. One-size-fits-all strategies may not serve the needs of the entire autistic community and could even create unrealistic expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the study’s strengths—including a large, well-matched sample, multiple validated measures, and preregistered analyses—there are some limitations. The researchers relied on self-reported diagnoses and did not independently verify clinical status using gold-standard assessments. They also focused on verbal measures of creativity, which may not capture all forms of creative expression, especially in autistic individuals with limited language skills. Additionally, the sample did not include autistic individuals with intellectual disability, so the results may not generalize to that group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could explore whether different types of creativity emerge in different contexts, such as when autistic individuals work within areas of personal interest or expertise. It may also be helpful to use nonverbal creativity tasks or investigate creativity across developmental stages and cultural backgrounds. Examining the cognitive and motivational pathways that underlie creativity in ADHD could also shed light on why this group consistently shows elevated creative output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1037/abn0000910" target="_blank"&gt;Enhanced Creativity in Autism Is Due to Co-Occurring Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Emily C.

Those symptoms can include a fever higher than 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit, as well as cough, runny nose and red eyes. After about four days of the fever, people then typically start developing a rash. According to state epidemiologist Dr. Leisha Nolen, the rash usually starts in peoples’ hairline before spreading across their face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine is 97% effective in protecting people against measles if they are given two doses, according to the state department. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Last Thursday, the department announced two cases, which brought the then-total amount of infected people to five, including one child. Health officials said that in both of those new cases, the department knew those people had been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Among those first five cases, two of the infected people had been pregnant, and two had been hospitalized and released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;The department recommends that people who plan to get pregnant should get vaccinated before becoming pregnant, to protect themselves and their baby through their pregnancy. Women who are pregnant cannot get the vaccine, according to the department, and pregnant people with measles face a higher risk for miscarriages and stillbirth — as well as medical issues for the baby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Nolen said people who are still unvaccinated should talk seriously with their doctors about their choice, and stressed that adults choosing to get vaccinated help protect babies who are not yet big enough to receive the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;A higher percentage of people in southern parts of Utah are unvaccinated, Nolen said, compared with other areas of the state. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#:~:text=Measles%20is%20not%20a%20seasonal,quarters%20(like%20summer%20camp)." target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html#:~:text=Measles%20is%20not%20a%20seasonal,quarters%20(like%20summer%20camp)."&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, there have been 27 outbreaks and a total of 1,267 confirmed measles cases throughout the country as of Tuesday. Three of those people have died because of the measles. The CDC reports there were a total of 285 confirmed cases in the United States in all of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;Though the CDC says “measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000,” the disease is currently spreading because “U.S. MMR coverage among kindergarteners is now below the 95% coverage target” and is decreasing, and “global measles activity is increasing.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-raw"&gt;In Utah’s 2024-25 school year, about 10% of kindergarteners either had an exemption from receiving the MMR vaccine or did not have documents that showed they were vaccinated, according to the state health department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Salt Lake Tribune</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 17:59:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE1Wd0h3RFZpYXNPRXlzSU9XSGY2azQyR3Z1RS01NjFTOGxHT09zaXRrZ3AtSE03b3EtaEo0S1llV00xbjhFXzJkbUVDSkpLeHpvSlgxNjdnSm8tUEJaME5BaHM4NUxoamtPdUtUZmlCQ2sybUVnTDBtdXNmaUM</guid></item><item><title>性建议：我的嗅觉发生了戏剧性的转变。它让性变得难以忍受。- Slate Magazine | Sex advice: My sense of smell has taken a dramatic turn.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="80" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcm4veju00123b760nvsdws3@published"&gt;I’m a 45-year-old pansexual woman. I’m in the early stages of perimenopause and have noticed some changes to my body. Mostly, they’re not too concerning to me because perimenopause is normal, and most symptoms are easy to deal with. My vagina is a little dryer, so I use more lube and my armpits are more sweaty, so I use more antiperspirant. But there’s one symptom that’s really creating some issues for me. My sense of smell is off the charts.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="115" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcm4vel900133b76igu8wrqc@published"&gt;If I’m in the car with someone who is talking, their breath is unbearable. I can smell stinky cheese in the fridge when the fridge is closed. Worst of all, the smell of bodies has become extremely off-putting. I’m not talking about bad body odor—just regular human smells. I recently started to get serious with a lovely genderqueer person, and we have great physical chemistry. But the smell of their skin, breath, and hair turns my stomach. If I focus on the sensations in my body, I can sometimes put the smells out of my mind. But other times, I just can’t, and I avoid any physical contact or even sitting too close to them.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcm4vemw00143b76v4adusbp@published"&gt;I’ve tried showering with them before sex to see if that helps (it doesn’t) and using scented products on my own skin to see if I can drown out their smell (I can’t). I know it’s me, and they smell perfectly normal. I don’t know how to bring this up without making them feel bad or self-conscious. And I’m especially loath to mention something that the other person cannot help or change. Any ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

Though hormonal changes can often result in an &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-56565-x"&gt;impaired sense of smell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://bywinona.com/journal/smell-and-taste?srsltid=AfmBOorXiZVQzk07mKUIqYeTZcF7vkoTqcx8ioVhUxnQFc4FNXK0Q7UO"&gt;anecdotal evidence&lt;/a&gt; shows that some people report a menopause-related heightened sense of smell.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="115" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcm4vesm00183b76ib14sit1@published"&gt;But like many things that affect women, these changes are poorly understood, and thus, there are not a lot of great solutions. You might start by seeing your doctor about any perimenopause-induced changes—there are &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/perimenopause/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20354671"&gt;treatments for the vaginal dryness you mention, for example, that they might recommend&lt;/a&gt;. As for the odors, I did see that someone in a Reddit thread recommended &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DY9N6LJ?th=1"&gt;this aromatherapy diffuser&lt;/a&gt;, which is a scented silicone ring that you wear like a septum piercing to mask whatever odors are making your life hell. There are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mini-Essential-Nose-Ring-Inhaler/dp/B0DL615Y69/ref=sr_1_15?crid=2VNM81LP2CVJQ&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.lRtwMHia39Q4gQseAOh0VYPc7rP2VgIpXoompMRgREd6Ot-npIR1tJ5xkau-hfYBrMFq8ExZxedjfW_22cci63lk-HQ352H2wxS3n3LffWElewfBknSw8aX81TtN3BEqWNIenOeg_PiNy_2g-XizWTmwLq-p_vrXB9zaujKzQg0v2tq7_8iH7P4vvlfYuOTGRz-pI-m87xNTgnIN1lPmn3g1yTr7FKCtEryn5fLwLA2V9rEdZ6wUswHYHkDtZgdgA2PBEniRE1qI2LCAC60Ugwp4c5pQ8jZ6nJl_W1u3l64.hX-XZ-3mHXcPxIYaljbr1We5rt5H3OuKwLueboKb6NE&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=silicone+nose+ring+for+essential+oils&amp;amp;qid=1751224361&amp;amp;sprefix=silicone+nose+ring+for,aps,116&amp;amp;sr=8-15&amp;amp;th=1"&gt;other options&lt;/a&gt;, too. The hurdle here might be finding an essential oil that doesn’t also turn your stomach. That may be a challenge in its own right.&lt;/p&gt;

You can explain that this is something that many menopausal women have reported. Rarely has “It’s not you, it’s me” been so apt and benign. It is literally the case. This is not about you being particularly sensitive about &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; smell; it is about being sensitive to &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; smells. (Citing the cheese-in-fridge example will be useful to show that. Think about whether there are other disturbing non-human smells that you can also point to.) Perhaps your partner can try to work with fragrance on themself to help mask their musk. Another possible solution? A nose clip that could effectively cut off &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; smells. Swimmers often use these (though you’d have to be pretty confident breathing through your mouth). Of course, wearing one without explanation would be extremely curious, so a conversation would be useful there.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcm4vevq001a3b76vaie8zc5@published"&gt;Your heightened sense of smell is not your fault and it should not be taken personally by an inadvertent offender. Hopefully your partner is mature enough to understand this and attempt to work with you (or at least not hold it against you for working through it yourself). You don’t have to get super specific about being distracted during sex—just keep it general, say it’s something that is affecting all facets of your life, and frame it as an issue to overcome so that you can continue to spend time with this person that you are so fond of.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="96" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcm4vlwx001n3b76brmvoueb@published"&gt;My boyfriend ejaculates A LOT. We tried condoms early on in our relationship, but I’ve had to switch to the pill after he literally overflowed a condom on more than one occasion. He says this has been going on since he was 20 (he’s 25 now). One time, he jerked off into a disposable measuring cup, and the amount totaled just over a quarter cup. When we have sex, I have to make sure I get to the bathroom fast after we finish to avoid a mess when things begin to leak. Is it normal for him to produce so much?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="87" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcm4vlwy001q3b76yua2kgl9@published"&gt;Well, it’s &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; normal! It sounds like he has &lt;a href="https://www.health.com/hyperspermia-8746676"&gt;hyperspermia&lt;/a&gt;, a medical condition that is generally considered benign. Typically, hyperspermia refers to semen volume that is above 6 milliliters or about 1.20 teaspoons (typical volume is &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003627.htm"&gt;1.5 to 5 milliliters per ejaculation&lt;/a&gt;). It may lead to fertility issues, perhaps because of the lower sperm concentration within the high fluid content, and the cause (at least for some) may have to do with an inflamed prostate, but other than that, it’s not really a thing doctors fret over.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="113" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcm4vlwy001r3b76hhak56yc@published"&gt;Many people enjoy it—big loads are prized by some. My X feed for a few months has regularly been showing me posts from people who have added zinc to their supplement stack and now are supposedly shooting mega loads (this is anecdotal at best and not going to work for everyone—I’m not convinced it’s even working for those engagement farmers). There are a number of supplements marketed to boost semen volume (for science, I’ve tried some and seen no change in my production). There’s a whole subreddit devoted to people capturing their giant loads on film (&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Hyperspermia/"&gt;r/hyperspermia&lt;/a&gt;—NSFW obviously). And porn has done a lot to argue the inherent value in copious cum delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcm4vlwy001s3b7625x7wvgn@published"&gt;Your boyfriend has what many wish they had. One &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221892317_Seminal_Volume_in_the_Investigation_of_Male_Infertility"&gt;study of semen volume found&lt;/a&gt; only 7.88 percent of 1,521 participants had what qualified as hyperspermia. So while your boyfriend’s condition may be rare, it’s far from unheard of. Try to find the joy in his gushes of love.&lt;/p&gt;

While it’s certainly possible that your husband is not being truthful or even deceiving you, there are other potential explanations worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="103" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcm4vud700293b768a8soqzw@published"&gt;For starters, he could just be telling the truth. Parenthood can be tough for some to navigate, and it can take months or years before elements of both of your lives return to looking like they did previous to the child. The stress of new parenting will affect different people in different ways. It’s completely understandable that some men will experience a swift kick to the libido (stress is, after all, a notorious &lt;a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/how-stress-can-lead-to-low-libido-3145029"&gt;sex drive killer&lt;/a&gt;). It doesn’t mean your husband isn’t attracted to you or that he’s putting his sexual energy elsewhere—he just might not be able to muster it at all.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="134" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcm4vud7002a3b76g7mqewqt@published"&gt;For some men, it also takes a while to bounce back after the baby is born. If your husband watched you give birth, he may be experiencing what Dr. Keith Ablow described in a New York Times &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/23/health/a-perilous-journey-from-delivery-room-to-bedroom.html"&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; some 20 years ago as a “post-traumatic stress disorder, with its roots in the witnessing of an event that involves a threat to the physical integrity of self or others and responding with intense fear, helplessness or horror.” In the piece Ablow describes having seen “dozens” of male patients presenting this kind of response after seeing their significant others give birth. Recognizing this is the first step—&lt;a href="https://health.cornell.edu/sites/health/files/pdf-library/sensate-focus.pdf"&gt;sensate focus&lt;/a&gt; (mindful touching) and general mindfulness may help ease affected men back toward having sex with their partners.

I think you should give him a bit more time. If you’re feeling insecure, tell him that. Ask for reassurance that he’s still attracted to you and isn’t having an affair. Inquire about what he &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; willing to offer intimacy-wise. It could be holding, massaging, kissing, or cuddling. There is some compromise to strike between where you are right now and where he is. If you don’t see progress (or at least an acknowledgement on his part that your sex life has changed considerably and that he’s willing to explore getting back on track) within a few more months, though, consider counseling.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmcm4vx72002o3b76pargobe0@published"&gt;I’m a healthy 43-year-old male with a robust sex drive. I take blood pressure medicine that causes my erections to be slightly less than ideal—not all the way ED, but noticeably less than great. My primary care doctor prescribed me Viagra for this, which has been working great for a few years now. About a year ago, mid-pandemic, my wife left me. In the last few months I’ve begun a new relationship with a woman I feel very comfortable with, and our sex life is fantastic. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/07/telling-girlfriend-viagra-use-sex-advice.html"&gt;However, she has no idea I use Viagra…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. reportedly sided with the previous Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices which, in April, recommended Moderna's mResvia for adults ages 50 to 59 who have a high risk of developing severe respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. The virus causes coldlike symptoms in most people, but can be serious or deadly in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June, Kennedy fired all 17 members of the former ACIP and installed his own panel of experts to weigh the risks and benefits of vaccines. So, the future of Moderna's mResvia remained cloudy. But, on June 25, &lt;a href="https://endpoints.news/cdc-expands-rsv-vaccine-recommendations-siding-with-previous-panel-of-agency-advisors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Kennedy adopted&lt;/a&gt; the prior panel's recommendation, industry publication Endpoints News reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Investor's Business Daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In afternoon trades, Moderna stock 5.8% to 30.30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Expanded RSV Vaccine Market&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RSV vaccine is Moderna's second commercial product, following its original Covid vaccine. It competes against shots from &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pfizer-stock-buy-now/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pfizer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PFE" target="_blank"&gt;PFE&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;strong&gt;GSK&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a class="ticker" href="https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GSK" target="_blank"&gt;GSK&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was originally approved and recommended for adults ages 75 and older, and for adults ages 60 to 74 with an increased risk of developing severe RSV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision Wednesday expands the market for mResvia which, in the first quarter, widely missed sales forecasts. The biopharma industry was watching Kennedy's decision as an indicator of how closely Kennedy could follow the ACIP's nonbinding recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moderna stock is currently trading above its &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/what-is-the-50-day-moving-average-when-to-buy-or-sell-growth-stocks/"&gt;50-day moving average&lt;/a&gt;, but below its &lt;a href="https://www.investors.com/how-to-invest/investors-corner/moving-averages-provide-effective-tool-for-your-trading/"&gt;200-day line&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;a href="https://get.investors.com/marketsurge/?src=apa1bq"&gt;MarketSurge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Pop culture references such as Ebenezer Scrooge attributing the ghosts that visit him to “a crumb of cheese” in “A Christmas Carol,” and a 20th-century comic strip depicting people’s unsettling dreams as the result of feasting on Welsh rarebit — a cheese-on-toast dish — have only perpetuated that idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1544475/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1544475/full"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal Frontiers in Psychology put to the test those long-held assumptions about dairy-related sleeping problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Researchers at MacEwan University surveyed 1,082 students to test people’s perceptions of how food impacts their dreams. The survey asked the students about their eating habits in general and before bed, food sensitivity, and sleep habits and quality, including dreams and nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="The-findings-..." class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;The findings ...&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Almost half of the surveyed participants reported that certain foods either worsened or improved their sleep. While 20% said food improved their sleep, nearly 25% agreed it worsened their sleep, and 5% noted it affected their dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;According to the researchers, those who perceived food-dependent dreaming experienced more frequent and disturbing dreams and often ignored hunger cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The majority of participants who attributed their poor sleep to food believed that sweets, spicy foods or dairy were to blame. Sweets were blamed the most, at 31%, whereas dairy was 22%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="5604" data-height="3736"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/E7LSTPGHAFFKRPSK5ZFGTNJC3Y.jpg?auth=564ef522561c9a091513ac826d22ddba1b1d610b493453b4680ef25eb0635172&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/E7LSTPGHAFFKRPSK5ZFGTNJC3Y.jpg?auth=564ef522561c9a091513ac826d22ddba1b1d610b493453b4680ef25eb0635172&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Snickers bars from Brazil are displayed for sale at Economy Candy in New York's Lower East Side, Friday, April 4, 2025. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Richard Drew, Associated Press &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;However, worse sleep perceptions were tied to lactose intolerance and gastrointestinal symptoms as well as late-night snacking. About 30% percent of people who believed their diet negatively affected their sleep were lactose intolerant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;“These new findings imply that changing eating habits for people with some food sensitivities could alleviate nightmares,” Dr. Tore Nielsen of Université de Montréal, lead author of the article, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1088938?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" title="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1088938?"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; released with the published article. “They could also explain why people so often blame dairy for bad dreams!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Consuming dairy might trigger gastrointestinal disturbances, and the resulting discomfort could impact people’s dreams and the quality of their rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="Foods-that-improve-sleep" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Foods that improve sleep&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;As recorded in the study, some participants reported improved sleep when consuming fruits and vegetables. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Nearly 18% of people that eat fruit regularly reported improved sleep, as did 12% of those who consume a lot of vegetables and 13% of those who drink herbal tea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="5472" data-height="3648"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/CY5JOSK34ZETFMAJ57QDTFYS4U.jpg?auth=9fde9b4a12f29d0f15b80c239a7825c253dfee235e587ac00da68c8df4295c01&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=533" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/CY5JOSK34ZETFMAJ57QDTFYS4U.jpg?auth=9fde9b4a12f29d0f15b80c239a7825c253dfee235e587ac00da68c8df4295c01&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1066 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;Vegetables are displayed for sale at a grocery store in River Ridge, La., on Wednesday, July 11, 2018. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| Gerald Herbert, Associated Press &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id="Dietary-restrictions" class="dn-article-body__h3"&gt;Dietary restrictions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;The research confirmed a strong link between food and sleep, with food sensitivities such as lactose intolerance as contributors to nightmare prevalence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;However, the exact relationship between diet and sleep is unclear. People might sleep poorly due to poor diet, or vice versa, or another factor could affect both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Suggesting that tummy troubles from dairy could cause strange or unsettling dreams, these findings opened the door for new research into how food affects dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="c-paragraph"&gt;Meanwhile, the implications might be enough for some individuals to adjust their own diets without professional intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="dn-article-body__image-wrapper" data-width="3696" data-height="2862"&gt;&lt;figure class="c-media-item dn-article-body__image"&gt;&lt;img data-chromatic="ignore" alt="" class="c-image" loading="lazy" src="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/HJRUD3M56ZHXNMZFEOAA5E6ELY.jpg?auth=6187501911ff23f7584efe5c8e3bd6eab2688888d23bae897b06959627d9196e&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=800&amp;amp;height=619" srcset="https://www.deseret.com/resizer/v2/HJRUD3M56ZHXNMZFEOAA5E6ELY.jpg?auth=6187501911ff23f7584efe5c8e3bd6eab2688888d23bae897b06959627d9196e&amp;amp;focal=0%2C0&amp;amp;width=1600&amp;amp;height=1238 2x"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="c-media-item__fig-caption"&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__caption"&gt;A shopper peruses cheese offerings at a Target store on Oct. 4, 2023, in Sheridan, Colo. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c-media-item__credit"&gt;| David Zalubowski, Associated Press &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Deseret News</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 17:15:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE9fa2YzTEcxaVdPcHJDZFkydkZZQmZ4T0lGY290T1hDbU1EYk1uVWZZckNhSlZCZDV6VXdsb2xkdDlWLURNb0RkYUpGNHVSY3I0YXpnTkVjNldJT0luQ3VJajJRTGQtdllUaXZ3MGlmQ250Qm5VQURWYQ</guid></item><item><title>专家警告不要使用有望消除压力和疲劳的病毒性鸡尾酒- dailymail.co.uk | Experts warn against viral cocktail that promises to banish stress and exhaustion - dailymail.co.uk</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNZWE3dURPUXdKbjE4Y3czd1lMWEc0eDhiODAyazN5WHFWcXdRbW03QjRPRDhOQmM4djVwVzZyeG1kTGttcHFfTVN6WlNqRGtMMTNQV3VINW1iU0R4clEza0VkaFk3cFh4Z0psTDNrZHlqbHpUSThFYUI4dkp0ZEQ0dF9mcEF3SzllTWljTTBGelNlMHZycmRfcVdKcVpwOS03YmlReVUyMnA0QdIBrwFBVV95cUxNSm1fbExGTzF1YXlUVkxXQ1hPcmlZWC1YOWgzVUFzQ1U3R011N2hBTFZ2SExtNklHSG12LUVzeURqV0FjYzVrMWJzUnVhUk93YzlVNDNBZmRCSDBqT3h4VGZxY0JQampnSXM4eEtabUpxMG1hM0xNZjZIQ3Q2YlBOMjE1MGZkcmJ4SDRCR2twQktDTVM0NXEteUtuYy1ROE5QSW5xV1JqR2VsNUEwN3Nv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A cocktail of fruit juices, sparkling water and vitamin powder might be the key to slashing stress hormones, influencers claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Social media influencers say they've concocted a viral 'cocktail' that lowers levels of cortisol, a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13951165/what-addisons-disease-causes-symptoms-overview.html"&gt;stress hormone that triggers the body's 'fight-or-flight' response&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It also regulates metabolism, blood sugar, blood pressure, inflammation and sleep, among other functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But too much cortisol can throw these processes into overdrive, leading to weight gain, heart disease, high cholesterol and infertility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the 'cortisol cocktail' contains ingredients that could keep cortisol under control with a mix of coconut water, lemon, orange juice, sea salt and sparkling water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The finishing touch is about a teaspoon of magnesium, a mineral that supports nearly 300 bodily processes, including immune health, muscle function and energy production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors told DailyMail.com that while the drink's ingredients all support relaxation and mood, they're unlikely to significantly lower cortisol levels on their own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They suggested people with consistently high cortisol should instead focus on more proven strategies like &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/femail/article-12350731/I-dropped-44LBS-menopause-weight-targeting-cortisol-levels-using-four-simple-hacks.html"&gt;exercise and eating a balanced diet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Influencers have claimed a viral 'cocktail' lowers levels of the stress hormone cortisol, but doctors speaking to DailyMail.com expressed doubts (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Charles Carlsen, an OBGYN and chief technology officer at DRSONO Medical, told this website: 'While ingredients in the cortisol cocktail, like magnesium and coconut water, have recognized medical properties — magnesium stimulates a feeling of calm and coconut water is a hydrator — there is not a lot of scientific evidence to support arguments that a given drink lowers stress hormones significantly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The nutrients in these drinks may support overall good health but are not a cure-all when it comes to stress hormones.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Jeffrey Ditzell, a psychiatrist in New York City, added: 'There is likely more hype than help with cortisol cocktails.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cortisol is known as the 'stress hormone' because it increases blood pressure and heart rate to put the body into 'fight-or-flight' mode and raises blood sugar levels to provide energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Daniel Atkinson, clinical lead at healthcare service company Treated, told DailyMail.com: 'When you encounter stress, your body raises its cortisol levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Cortisol also plays a part in regulating your blood pressure, immune system, and sleep-wake cycle.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The hormone is produced by the adrenal glands, which sit on top of the kidneys. Too little cortisol can send the body into an adrenal crisis, leading to low blood pressure, dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, fever and trouble breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But high cortisol levels can slow metabolism, raise cholesterol levels, increase heart rate and blood pressure and disrupt sleep, Dr Carlsen said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Concerns arise when someone has persistent symptoms like fatigue, insomnia, mood changes, or unexplained weight changes; especially if accompanied by physical signs like high blood pressure or abdominal weight gain.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Carlsen noted doctors can test for elevated cortisol with blood, saliva and urine samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Angela Downey, a family physician at The Codependent Doctor, told DailyMail.com: 'The tests are often done at specific times during the day as your cortisol naturally changes through the day.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One of the cortisol cocktail's main ingredients is about 200 milligrams of magnesium powder, which costs anywhere from $15 to $30 per tub, depending on the size. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The recommended daily dose is about 400 to 420 milligrams for men and 310 to 320 milligrams for women.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Atkinson said while magnesium deficiency has been linked to high cortisol, 'raising your magnesium levels won't happen instantly by including around 200 milligrams of it in a drink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's no guarantee how much magnesium in a supplement form your body will absorb, so if you know your magnesium levels are low, you'd probably be better off trying to include more magnesium-rich foods in your diet, such as whole grains, legumes and nuts.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The cortisol cocktail contains coconut water, lemon and orange juice, magnesium powder, sea salt and sparkling water (stock image) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Additionally, drinking multiple cortisol cocktails in a day could raise the risk of magnesium toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Carlsen told this website: 'Over intake of magnesium leads to diarrhea, stomach discomfort, and various gastrointestinal symptoms.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also added 'excessive magnesium is also not good in kidney disease patients,' as they can't properly filter out magnesium and other nutrients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Even ingredients like fruit juice and sparkling water, Dr Atkinson said, could cause gastrointestinal discomfort, especially in people who have one of these drinks every day.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Orange juice and coconut water, meanwhile, are hydrating and packed with inflammation-lowering vitamin C, they can also be high in added sugars, 'which might not be ideal for people with insulin resistance, diabetes or PCOS,' Dr Downey told this website. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Carlsen instead points to habits like diet and exercise and tried and true ways top lower cortisol. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Moderate exercise like cycling, tennis and yoga, for example, is thought to reduce cortisol by producing mood-boosting hormones called endorphins and improving sleep quality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Foods rich in antioxidants like berries, dark chocolate and green tea also lower inflammation and prevent stress-induced cell damage.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Carlsen added: 'While there is possible benefit with the hydrating and refreshing ingredients of a cortisol cocktail, it is not a definitive fix to low cortisol. Evidence-based remedies like a good-health lifestyle and stress relief are superior long-term fixes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Always consult with a healthcare specialist should you be concerned with your level of cortisol or general health.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>dailymail.co.uk</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 16:43:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNZWE3dURPUXdKbjE4Y3czd1lMWEc0eDhiODAyazN5WHFWcXdRbW03QjRPRDhOQmM4djVwVzZyeG1kTGttcHFfTVN6WlNqRGtMMTNQV3VINW1iU0R4clEza0VkaFk3cFh4Z0psTDNrZHlqbHpUSThFYUI4dkp0ZEQ0dF9mcEF3SzllTWljTTBGelNlMHZycmRfcVdKcVpwOS03YmlReVUyMnA0QdIBrwFBVV95cUxNSm1fbExGTzF1YXlUVkxXQ1hPcmlZWC1YOWgzVUFzQ1U3R011N2hBTFZ2SExtNklHSG12LUVzeURqV0FjYzVrMWJzUnVhUk93YzlVNDNBZmRCSDBqT3h4VGZxY0JQampnSXM4eEtabUpxMG1hM0xNZjZIQ3Q2YlBOMjE1MGZkcmJ4SDRCR2twQktDTVM0NXEteUtuYy1ROE5QSW5xV1JqR2VsNUEwN3Nv</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，与肺癌驱动DNA突变相关的空气污染-《卫报》 | Air pollution linked to lung cancer-driving DNA mutations, study finds - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxOUFJqUEZMVDRyTVVxMm4yZWZJM3JVQ1E0RlZFcDVLVm5JbTd2N0JGWTZGazBjRzkxOFRjdnlNV0JJdkpRV01PeE1kNThBUFQtcmttcHpaLVA3dlgyMkxha3YtZ0xzXzVZdDVmcWhmTlkyWHE5UE93WFpvekFpSWJuRVY4RlVWZjA2NncybUZ1UkNjeC04OEVIQw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Air pollution has been linked to a swathe of lung cancer-driving DNA mutations, in a study of people diagnosed with the disease despite never having smoked tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The findings from an investigation into cancer patients around the world helps explain why those who have never smoked make up a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/feb/03/lung-cancer-never-smokers-rise-worldwide-air-p" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;rising proportion&lt;/a&gt; of people developing the cancer, a trend the researchers called an “urgent and growing global problem”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"science","tags":[{"id":"science/cancer","type":"Keyword","title":"Cancer research"},{"id":"society/lung-cancer","type":"Keyword","title":"Lung cancer"},{"id":"society/cancer","type":"Keyword","title":"Cancer"},{"id":"environment/air-pollution","type":"Keyword","title":"Air pollution"},{"id":"environment/environment","type":"Keyword","title":"Environment"},{"id":"science/science","type":"Keyword","title":"Science"},{"id":"world/world","type":"Keyword","title":"World news"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/news","type":"Tone","title":"News"},{"id":"profile/iansample","type":"Contributor","title":"Ian Sample","twitterHandle":"iansample","bylineImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2024/11/15/Ian_Sample.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=8e4848b5cd47215a09f2a5d1f2d4dd9d","bylineLargeImageUrl":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2024/11/15/Ian_Sample,_L.png?width=300&amp;amp;quality=85&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;fit=max&amp;amp;s=9455f2ae800441cdaea2f1e216d52ea5"},{"id":"publication/theguardian","type":"Publication","title":"The Guardian"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection","type":"NewspaperBook","title":"Main section"},{"id":"theguardian/mainsection/uknews","type":"NewspaperBookSection","title":"UK news"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/uk-home-news","type":"Tracking","title":"UK Home News"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"science/2025/jul/02/air-pollution-lung-cancer-dna-mutations-study","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Prof Ludmil Alexandrov, a senior author on the study at the University of California in San Diego, said researchers had observed the “problematic trend” but had not understood the cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Our research shows that air pollution is strongly associated with the same types of DNA mutations we typically associate with smoking,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The scientists analysed the entire genetic code of lung tumours removed from 871 never-smokers in Europe, North America, Africa and Asia as part of the &lt;a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/cancer-types/lung/sherlock-lung-study" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Sherlock-Lung study&lt;/a&gt;. They found that the higher the levels of air pollution in a region, the more cancer-driving and cancer-promoting mutations were present in residents’ tumours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Fine-particulate air pollution was in particular linked to mutations in the TP53 gene. These have previously been associated with tobacco smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;People exposed to greater air pollution also had shorter telomeres, protective strands of DNA found at the ends of chromosomes, which are often compared with the caps on shoelaces. Premature shortening of telomeres is a sign of more rapid cell division, a hallmark of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This is an urgent and growing global problem that we are working to understand,” said Dr Maria Teresa Landi, an epidemiologist on the study at the US National &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/cancer" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Institute in Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;With smoking in decline in many parts of the world, including the UK and the US, people who have never smoked are making up a larger proportion of lung cancer patients. Current estimates suggest that 10-25% of lung cancers are now diagnosed in this group. Almost all such cancers are a form known as adenocarcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. About 2.5m new cases are diagnosed globally each year. More than a million of the deaths occur in China, where smoking, air pollution and other environmental contaminants are factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Recent &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/feb/09/air-pollution-causing-lung-cancer-uk" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; found that the highest rates of adenocarcinoma attributable to air pollution were in east Asia. While cases in the UK were much lower, they still amounted to more than 1,100 new diagnoses a year, scientists found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The latest work, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09219-0" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in Nature&lt;/a&gt;, identified only a slight rise in cancer-causing mutations in people exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But the study highlighted a significant risk from certain Chinese herbal medicines that contain aristolochic acid. Signature mutations linked to the herbal medicines were seen almost exclusively in never-smokers from Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Another mysterious mutational signature was seen in people who had never smoked but not those who did, and was now the focus of “intense investigation”, Landi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 16:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimAFBVV95cUxOUFJqUEZMVDRyTVVxMm4yZWZJM3JVQ1E0RlZFcDVLVm5JbTd2N0JGWTZGazBjRzkxOFRjdnlNV0JJdkpRV01PeE1kNThBUFQtcmttcHpaLVA3dlgyMkxha3YtZ0xzXzVZdDVmcWhmTlkyWHE5UE93WFpvekFpSWJuRVY4RlVWZjA2NncybUZ1UkNjeC04OEVIQw</guid></item><item><title>新的研究表明，关于衰老的常见假设可能是错误的-独立报 | New study suggests common assumption about aging could be wrong - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipwFBVV95cUxPM1ZmcFNILWgxNGZiNUNnRm9mRGFkSXJIYWRGRkNhOWt6cHd4YnZFQ1ZxNmo5M0c1VlRVOTNmVmRVTDJoTW44SnlIY2tKeUMxUURKZjF5QlpLMjA2UHRsel9USl9OVEtGSTNqc0lQQzJxdU5XU1hXSWd2SExtWTg0WHNIVXV1M2ZfeFNqRkJ4b1J2bkM2Y1NNZmVpMHYwX0dHSFJXY01zVQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 gryCYY sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 dFpFuY"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 dmMyEN"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 fXvmgM"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 juUDRT"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cqPbFA"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 rAFIl sc-hez36s-16 jZSKtc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 PdmgT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 hJPJVF"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 lcJUSj"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 laZbyn"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 cKWiEj"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

Inflammation protects the body from injury or infection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic inflammation is thought to speed up the ageing process and contribute to various health conditions such as &lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/alzheimers-dementia-research-protein-ptau217-b2780235.html"&gt;Alzheimer’s &lt;/a&gt;disease, &lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/arthritis-flare-up-symptoms-advice-summer-b2770041.html"&gt;arthritis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="/bulletin/lifestyle/alcohol-smoking-overweight-early-death-b2778438.html"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, heart disease, and Type 2 diabetes, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6146930/"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Researchers have long believed that most older people will suffer from inflammageing as they age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However the study, published in Nature Age this week, found that people in nonindustrialized areas experience inflammation differently than those in urban areas and there may be another cause behind it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers&lt;a rel="nofollow" data-affiliate="true" target="_blank" href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/esimedia_t58ukgmjkf95_theindependent?q=http%3A%2F%2Fgo.redirectingat.com%2F%3Fid%3D44681X1458326%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.nature.com%252Farticles%252Fs43587-025-00888-0%26sref%3D%2Fnews%2Fhealth%2Finflammation-aging-cause-study-common-assumption-b2781348.html&amp;amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fhealth%2Finflammation-aging-cause-study-common-assumption-b2781348.html&amp;amp;article_id=2781348&amp;amp;author=Madeline+Sherratt&amp;amp;tag=Inflammation%2Caging%2CHeart+Disease%2CBiology%2CType+2+diabetes&amp;amp;section=Health&amp;amp;category=N%2FA&amp;amp;sub_category=N%2FA&amp;amp;updated_time=2025-07-02T16%3A24%3A03.000Z&amp;amp;utm_content=N%2FA&amp;amp;utm_campaign=news-body&amp;amp;utm_term=B-1&amp;amp;utm_medium=N%2FA&amp;amp;ref=N%2FA&amp;amp;utm_source=direct&amp;amp;fbclid=N%2FA&amp;amp;gclid=N%2FA"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; compared the lives of two indigenous, nonindustrialized populations - the Tsimane from the Bolivian Amazon and the Orang Asli from Peninsular Malaysia - with two groups from Italy and Singapore. Researchers compared blood samples from about 2,800 adults between 18 and 95 in the four groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that chronic inflammation may not be linked explicitly to ageing, but rather that diet, lifestyle and environmental factors are more significant factors than previously thought. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that inflammation in the nonindustrialized groups did not appear to increase as subjects got older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan Cohen, associate professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University and co-author of the study, said the findings suggest inflammation is “more complex than we currently understand.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 gWMNUM"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/01/15/27/iStock-1354565598.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/01/15/27/iStock-1354565598.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/01/15/27/iStock-1354565598.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Lifestyle has a significant impact on ‘inflammaging’ says new study" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-24695"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Lifestyle has a significant impact on ‘inflammaging’ says new study&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Tsimane and Orang Asli differ from us in all these ways,” he told The Independent. “The insight of our study is not to say we need to be more active, but to challenge the idea that we understand biology well and can micromanage it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“So it’s a warning – don’t follow the latest trends of eating foods specifically to reduce inflammation, or whatever else the trend of the week may be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, other experts shared a word of caution before jumping to conclusions from the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vishwa Deep Dixit, director of the Yale Center for Research on Aging, told the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; it’s not surprising that people less exposed to pollution would see lower rates of chronic disease. The findings should lead to valuable discussion but would need further study “before we rewrite the inflammaging narrative,” professor of pharmacology at the University of Virginia School of Medicine Bimal Desai added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 16:24:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxPM1ZmcFNILWgxNGZiNUNnRm9mRGFkSXJIYWRGRkNhOWt6cHd4YnZFQ1ZxNmo5M0c1VlRVOTNmVmRVTDJoTW44SnlIY2tKeUMxUURKZjF5QlpLMjA2UHRsel9USl9OVEtGSTNqc0lQQzJxdU5XU1hXSWd2SExtWTg0WHNIVXV1M2ZfeFNqRkJ4b1J2bkM2Y1NNZmVpMHYwX0dHSFJXY01zVQ</guid></item><item><title>根据新的研究，加工肉类没有安全的食用量- CNN | There is no safe amount of processed meat to eat, according to new research - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxOTTNIempGeWhyQmZkNElDbWZWTENUbGU2bDJQVmVnZ280ZTdIOFNXalhKa2NRQVpXY3RSM1F4YWNqUVJTWmctRFNqQURlS0JKbnprRlJiSDNiLTk4WlRCTXl3ZzFJME9pZmlmQl81bUV2QVFsVFB4SDlBRmVtUmhhV0pEaElHeVJweGFF0gGQAUFVX3lxTE9XSWxVVXdFLWlyTl9MSHJHVHI1UHRFd0FXNlVBajVoV19ubzNVME9zQ2dEWVRwdkhaVDBQYk91LTF0TWFaSlY3eUh4RDNjb3VDdUpXOHpKclJlc1poRlNYY2ItSGNSVU5NYTVlaURwc1kyTnZkazYxWmpDTi0wd1ZIbTBzRmRQZjZFYnVuREpBLQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3gdkm004k26p38veba25i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There is strong evidence that there is “no safe amount” of processed meat to eat, nutrition experts say in response to a new study on the connection between diet and the risk of major diseases, including cancer, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. The researchers also found elevated risks from the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and trans fatty acids.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjg00043b6mujuyn2nb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers analyzed data from more than 60 previous studies on the relationship between processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages and trans fatty acids in a person’s diet and their risk of type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer and ischemic heart disease, which reduces blood supply to the heart and cuts off oxygen and nutrients, according to the study published Monday in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03775-8#author-information" target="_blank"&gt;the journal Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh00053b6moenjnd9y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Habitual consumption of even small amounts of processed meat, sugary drinks, and trans fatty acids is linked to increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, ischemic heart disease and colorectal cancer,” said lead author of the study, Dr. Demewoz Haile, a research scientist at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh00063b6mmb5ywymh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The data showed that people who ate as little as one hot dog a day when it comes to processed meats had an 11% greater risk of type 2 diabetes and a 7% increased risk of colorectal cancer than those who didn’t eat any. And drinking the equivalent of about a 12-ounce soda per day was associated with an 8% increase in type 2 diabetes risk and a 2% increased risk of ischemic heart disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh00073b6mw9snhzpw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This current research has shown, yet again and consistent with prior research … that to achieve health gains it is best to avoid or minimize the habitual consumption of each of processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and industrially produced trans fatty acids (TFAs),” said Dr. Nita Forouhi, head of nutritional epidemiology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh00083b6moof2nam0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The risk increased as consumption increased; and for processed meat consumption, the data showed that there is no “safe amount,” she added in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh00093b6m1rl5pv0m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At first glance, the increase in risk seems modest and might look like the association is weak, said Dr. Mingyang Song, associate professor of clinical epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan Schoo of Public Healthl. He was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000a3b6m6hy79tqv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When we look at the actual data there, it’s really remarkably consistent and remarkably strong, and even in the lower dose of consumption, we can still see an increased risk of disease,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000b3b6mzfo2qee4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers examined dozens of earlier findings on diet and disease using a burden-of-proof method: a newer form of meta-analysis that not only tries to quantify an association across multiple studies but also accounts for the quality of each, Song said. “One caveat is it tends to give very conservative results,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000c3b6ms2vpk3wr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s also important to note that the studies included in the analysis were observational, meaning that the data can only show an association between eating habits and disease –– not prove that what people ate caused the disease. They also relied on people recalling their dietary patterns, which can leave room for misremembering or misreporting, said Dr. Gunter Kuhnle, professor of nutrition and food science at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom. He was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000d3b6m4eo4udq2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Utilizing even “the most sophisticated techniques does not really solve the problem that the information about diet is rather limited – which is obviously a big problem in nutritional epidemiology in general,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmcm3hc1r000q3b6mm6tbqpos@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="why-meats-drinks-and-fats-are-linked-to-disease" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Why meats, drinks and fats are linked to disease
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000e3b6m9kvq8fri@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are many reasons why such foods could be associated with health problems. Sugar-sweetened beverages and processed meat –– such as sausages, bacon, salami and burgers –– can increase inflammation, which plays a big part in a variety of chronic diseases, Song said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000f3b6mydnu1r33@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Processed meats are also often cured with nitrite, which is converted to carcinogenic nitrosamines in the stomach, Kuhnle said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000g3b6mvi3tgb79@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The problem with sugary drinks is that they are a quick way to consume large amounts of sugar, he added. Not only can that cause weight gain, but it also influences metabolic pathways that affect heart disease and diabetes risk, Kuhnle said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000h3b6mwi2auqye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Trans fatty acids reduce levels of good cholesterol and increase the bad, which is known to increase the risk of plaque buildup in arteries and heart disease, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000i3b6moz0ld5ii@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other potential connections to consider  are that people who are more likely to eat processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages and trans-fats are often also at a higher risk of diseases because of “lifestyle factors (smoking, lack of exercise), but also social factors such as education and income, chronic stress and limited access to health care,” Kuhnle said. “It is very difficult to take these apart.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmcm3hc2b000r3b6m32remwn2@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="what-to-avoid-and-what-to-add" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        What to avoid and what to add
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000j3b6mcciskhye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the data can’t say reducing your consumption of these foods and drinks will cause a lower risk of the diseases, it does suggest that a reduction is a good idea, Song said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000k3b6mulgciljj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A sensible approach is to follow a varied and balanced diet that avoids excess, Kuhnle said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000l3b6mc7j05o4i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That means people who drink a lot of sugary drinks should cut back, he said. It can also be helpful to avoid excess amounts of processed meats and avoid hydrogenated fats where possible –– although they are no longer as common as they used to be, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000m3b6m9mpbsly2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The goal shouldn’t be perfection but rather a healthy and sensible dietary pattern that allows room for enjoyment,” Kuhnle said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000n3b6mtnr95goq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A good diet isn’t just about what to avoid. It’s also important to get good nutrients, Forouhi said. “Wider research has shown us that overall dietary patterns that include higher consumption of fruit and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and fermented dairy products like yogurt are good for health and longevity,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000o3b6m5bi90768@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My general advice: don’t panic,” Kuhnle said in an email. “Food is not just (a)&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;source of nutrients –– it plays a central role in culture, pleasure, family life, and social connection. Reducing it solely to a list of health risks misses the bigger picture.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            There is strong evidence that there is “no safe amount” of processed meat to eat, nutrition experts say in response to a new study on the connection between diet and the risk of major diseases, including cancer, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. The researchers also found elevated risks from the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and trans fatty acids.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjg00043b6mujuyn2nb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Researchers analyzed data from more than 60 previous studies on the relationship between processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages and trans fatty acids in a person’s diet and their risk of type 2 diabetes, colorectal cancer and ischemic heart disease, which reduces blood supply to the heart and cuts off oxygen and nutrients, according to the study published Monday in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03775-8#author-information" target="_blank"&gt;the journal Nature Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh00053b6moenjnd9y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Habitual consumption of even small amounts of processed meat, sugary drinks, and trans fatty acids is linked to increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, ischemic heart disease and colorectal cancer,” said lead author of the study, Dr. Demewoz Haile, a research scientist at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh00063b6mmb5ywymh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The data showed that people who ate as little as one hot dog a day when it comes to processed meats had an 11% greater risk of type 2 diabetes and a 7% increased risk of colorectal cancer than those who didn’t eat any. And drinking the equivalent of about a 12-ounce soda per day was associated with an 8% increase in type 2 diabetes risk and a 2% increased risk of ischemic heart disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh00073b6mw9snhzpw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This current research has shown, yet again and consistent with prior research … that to achieve health gains it is best to avoid or minimize the habitual consumption of each of processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) and industrially produced trans fatty acids (TFAs),” said Dr. Nita Forouhi, head of nutritional epidemiology at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom. She was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh00083b6moof2nam0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The risk increased as consumption increased; and for processed meat consumption, the data showed that there is no “safe amount,” she added in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh00093b6m1rl5pv0m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At first glance, the increase in risk seems modest and might look like the association is weak, said Dr. Mingyang Song, associate professor of clinical epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan Schoo of Public Healthl. He was not involved in the research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000a3b6m6hy79tqv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When we look at the actual data there, it’s really remarkably consistent and remarkably strong, and even in the lower dose of consumption, we can still see an increased risk of disease,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000b3b6mzfo2qee4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The researchers examined dozens of earlier findings on diet and disease using a burden-of-proof method: a newer form of meta-analysis that not only tries to quantify an association across multiple studies but also accounts for the quality of each, Song said. “One caveat is it tends to give very conservative results,” he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000c3b6ms2vpk3wr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s also important to note that the studies included in the analysis were observational, meaning that the data can only show an association between eating habits and disease –– not prove that what people ate caused the disease. They also relied on people recalling their dietary patterns, which can leave room for misremembering or misreporting, said Dr. Gunter Kuhnle, professor of nutrition and food science at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom. He was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000d3b6m4eo4udq2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Utilizing even “the most sophisticated techniques does not really solve the problem that the information about diet is rather limited – which is obviously a big problem in nutritional epidemiology in general,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmcm3hc1r000q3b6mm6tbqpos@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="why-meats-drinks-and-fats-are-linked-to-disease" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Why meats, drinks and fats are linked to disease
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000e3b6m9kvq8fri@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are many reasons why such foods could be associated with health problems. Sugar-sweetened beverages and processed meat –– such as sausages, bacon, salami and burgers –– can increase inflammation, which plays a big part in a variety of chronic diseases, Song said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000f3b6mydnu1r33@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Processed meats are also often cured with nitrite, which is converted to carcinogenic nitrosamines in the stomach, Kuhnle said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000g3b6mvi3tgb79@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The problem with sugary drinks is that they are a quick way to consume large amounts of sugar, he added. Not only can that cause weight gain, but it also influences metabolic pathways that affect heart disease and diabetes risk, Kuhnle said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000h3b6mwi2auqye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Trans fatty acids reduce levels of good cholesterol and increase the bad, which is known to increase the risk of plaque buildup in arteries and heart disease, he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000i3b6moz0ld5ii@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other potential connections to consider  are that people who are more likely to eat processed meats, sugar-sweetened beverages and trans-fats are often also at a higher risk of diseases because of “lifestyle factors (smoking, lack of exercise), but also social factors such as education and income, chronic stress and limited access to health care,” Kuhnle said. “It is very difficult to take these apart.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmcm3hc2b000r3b6m32remwn2@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="what-to-avoid-and-what-to-add" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        What to avoid and what to add
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000j3b6mcciskhye@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Although the data can’t say reducing your consumption of these foods and drinks will cause a lower risk of the diseases, it does suggest that a reduction is a good idea, Song said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000k3b6mulgciljj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A sensible approach is to follow a varied and balanced diet that avoids excess, Kuhnle said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000l3b6mc7j05o4i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That means people who drink a lot of sugary drinks should cut back, he said. It can also be helpful to avoid excess amounts of processed meats and avoid hydrogenated fats where possible –– although they are no longer as common as they used to be, he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000m3b6m9mpbsly2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The goal shouldn’t be perfection but rather a healthy and sensible dietary pattern that allows room for enjoyment,” Kuhnle said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000n3b6mtnr95goq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A good diet isn’t just about what to avoid. It’s also important to get good nutrients, Forouhi said. “Wider research has shown us that overall dietary patterns that include higher consumption of fruit and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts and fermented dairy products like yogurt are good for health and longevity,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmcm3hbjh000o3b6m5bi90768@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My general advice: don’t panic,” Kuhnle said in an email. “Food is not just (a)&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;source of nutrients –– it plays a central role in culture, pleasure, family life, and social connection. Reducing it solely to a list of health risks misses the bigger picture.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

They include medications like citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), and fluoxetine (Prozac), and millions of people take them every year in the U.S. While having extra serotonin floating around in your system — and thereby boosting your mood — is the primary effect of taking an SSRI, one potential side effect is that some of them might impact the system that the body uses to regulate temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ERBUPAZVDRFLVESMLTRZETVZTI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“SSRIs are known to make people — not everybody — sweat excessively,” said &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/gerard-sanacora/" target="_blank"&gt;Gerard Sanacora&lt;/a&gt;, professor of psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine. “And in those people, there’s always the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/12/06/eight-cups-daily-water-intake/" target="_blank"&gt;dehydration&lt;/a&gt;, especially on very hot days.” One 2005 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3931183/" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; suggested that up to 20 percent of SSRI users might experience excessive sweating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FY5P47C2AZAKRNYYF44UUZRFMU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Here’s how SSRIs affect the body, especially when it’s hot outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="QRVXSDRWW5FE7AQAZLLRWBMMMM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="QRVXSDRWW5FE7AQAZLLRWBMMMM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;The ways SSRIs impact your body in the heat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IW4YM7UPGZCYPP4B44M4AWVKHU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;SSRIs can impact the function of the hypothalamus, a part of the brain responsible for temperature regulation, said &lt;a href="https://www.bmc.org/about-us/directory/doctor/christine-m-crawford-md-mph" target="_blank"&gt;Christine M. Crawford,&lt;/a&gt; a psychiatrist with Boston Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CAQ4SPYPPBD67L42HHA2JH5L6U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“When people are sensitive to any changes in levels of serotonin, their hypothalamus responds differently,” she noted, adding that these mechanisms are also responsible for helping to cool a person’s body through sweat and vasodilation, a.k.a. the widening of blood vessels to boost blood flow. “So when that is altered, they just feel hotter,” Crawford explains. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/04/10/night-sweats-sleep-causes-treatment/" target="_blank"&gt;Night sweats&lt;/a&gt; also tend to be a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4883206/" target="_blank"&gt;common complaint&lt;/a&gt; among SSRI users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="Q77QY6KXSZG7DKG6J7DFQ3IR2U" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;An SSRI might cause someone to become excessively sweaty or even perspire &lt;i&gt;less&lt;/i&gt;, which can be dangerous if the body can’t cool itself down with sweat and overheats. “It really depends on the individual,” Sanacora notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BCDR7JYI7JCHPFY4ZLEWIRYKFI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/specialists/john-krystal" target="_blank"&gt;John Krystal&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine, said in an email that some tricyclic antidepressants — another type of medication used to treat depression — can block certain brain receptors that help with sweating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5LD4B2PQQ5FP5BW6CZSBRKFAGA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;And it’s not just antidepressants, Crawford said. Beta blockers, antihistamines, and even pain meds like acetaminophen, aspirin, and NSAIDs, can &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/heat-health/hcp/clinical-guidance/heat-and-medications-guidance-for-clinicians.html" target="_blank"&gt;cause heat intolerance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="6FOLWHD4HJC3DCVTBOLKMZX36I" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="6FOLWHD4HJC3DCVTBOLKMZX36I" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How to stay safe in hot temps, on antidepressants or not&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2VWJSJDTLBHQXGPORHR7ULIAAM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;No matter what the weather forecast looks like, don’t stop taking an SSRI&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;without the help of a health care provider&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="E2QLZWDCDZF7NFAROVHJPVL5AE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“You don’t want to stop treatment and then have more severe symptoms that could potentially lead to a mental health crisis,” Sanacora explained, adding that abruptly stopping an SSRI can make you feel even hotter than you might’ve felt while taking the medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PFUARQJSBRCW3IWFJCBANSQGKM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Here are a few tips to keep safe in hot temperatures:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ol class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="UGWV75TUHNAZXD2AK3HBI3A3XY" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Talk to your health care provider. &lt;/b&gt;If you think your medication is making you excessively sweaty or uncomfortable in the heat, call your doctor, Sanacora said. They can potentially put you on a different medication or help you find another solution.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Limit your exposure on particularly sweltering days. &lt;/b&gt;“Try to stay out of the excessively hot weather if possible, and especially high humidity,” Sanacora said. “That combination of high temperature, high humidity makes it very hard to cool the body temperature.” If you have to be out when temps soar, try to take breaks in indoor malls, libraries, or any public air-conditioned facility. Here’s how to &lt;a href="https://nchh.org/information-and-evidence/learn-about-healthy-housing/emergencies/extreme-heat/cooling-centers-by-state/" target="_blank"&gt;find a local cooling center near you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stay hydrated. &lt;/b&gt;Sanacora recommends keeping up on your fluid intake throughout the day — so your urine stays a pale yellow — and add in electrolytes if you’re going to be in excessive heat for long periods of time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dress appropriately.&lt;/b&gt; “Wear clothes that can wick,” Sanacora said, adding that our body cools itself when sweat evaporates properly, so if perspiration is stuck to your skin (especially if you’re sweating more on an SSRI), you could feel a lot more uncomfortable. Opt for natural vs. synthetic fibers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Let go of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;looking&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt; cool in favor of actually being cool. &lt;/b&gt;Crawford recommends a mini fan around your neck on hot days. You could even opt for a sun-shielding umbrella. (I’m a huge fan of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/FROGG-TOGGS-Instant-reusable-Outdoors/dp/B002NGSB96/ref=sr_1_11?crid=1XTXP8YG4TGWN&amp;amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.J2ojeV8X-t8DYPG4I2GC0p5WITirGCNtb0NufXg7V-eE1GJ246ySze3bChPSHcdiEfT7Xkys9VqagiiLJ_7Hc4YeaVvlpuTLJ2sb76eDcmIyvuQFzbJ_W0yk57P4FXVnQGrQZVH98_-F77Fs4J_NPLTwj4GYISye61s9QO-OQ_X3RyZAYa6lcvnjoO3e_nmqn1cZrMJzZz2n_mIMEejP8qGDoSGTEkVi9X14tudOiMkk7snjf4bDbT6TWZmG4i9N_OphQTVtkj2W9-lCm6iCIcCROfpLuzYTPVLmqGtqutw.AH0GMOWHc3FIN54vD8yinqGLPgmpF2e7BZvR_gz06a4&amp;amp;dib_tag=se&amp;amp;keywords=cooling+towel&amp;amp;qid=1750971843&amp;amp;sprefix=cooling+towel+amazon%2Caps%2C432&amp;amp;sr=8-11" target="_blank"&gt;cooling towels&lt;/a&gt;, which helped me survive a recent rim-to-rim Grand Canyon hike.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Know the signs of heat exhaustion. &lt;/b&gt;This includes dizziness, headache, nausea, reduced urine output, and an elevated body temperature. “If these signs are present, it is important to take steps to cool off before more serious complications of overheating emerge, such as &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/07/06/heatstroke-exercise-brain-hot-weather/" target="_blank"&gt;heatstroke&lt;/a&gt;, which is characterized by confusion, excessive sweating or hot skin, but can progress to loss of consciousness, and seizures,” Krystal said. If your core body temp rises to 104 degrees (which can happen with heatstroke), it can damage the kidneys, brain, heart, and muscles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keep your room cool at night&lt;/b&gt;. If you’re prone to night sweats, it’s extra important to stay hydrated throughout the day. Try to keep your bedroom as cool as possible — somewhere between 60 and 68 degrees — and crank a nearby fan on high. Avoid memory foam mattresses, as those can trap heat. As for sheets, skip satin and wool materials, and invest in linen over cotton. While linen can be expensive, it might be worth it if you are perspiring through your bedding. FYI: Night sweats can also be indicative of underlying hormonal shifts, like menopause and perimenopause, so talk with your doctor regardless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6HUNYI76LBA2NF3ZNVOG5GB4MA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;While you may be at a slightly higher risk for heat-related illnesses, that shouldn’t deter you from getting on, or continuing, an antidepressant if you need one, Sanacora said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KZ66DK52VNFVDKASU7ZRFCWJHI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“You have to be really careful in excessively hot weather, regardless of whether you’re on an SSRI or not,” Sanacora said. “But you may want to even be a little bit extra careful if you are taking an SSRI.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Wed, 02 Jul 2025 16:02:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifkFVX3lxTFBvZUt3ODNZVGZySUlmWHhDMEY2bGI1VHA0NTB0VVlhQUtfVUZnc21jelAzN1dXNmxpM2lpdG82X2trSkw4aGF0dExUU3RnLWwwaWp3UzVjbVV2di0tUHdGQW5mLXVDZ25TV0pvQ0RXV2Z5cnEwVkRIVWxSM0d3UQ</guid></item><item><title>科学家发现运动Lifehack ：上床睡觉- Gizmodo | Scientists Uncover Exercise Lifehack: Go to Bed - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigwFBVV95cUxPMFJYTHVKbkpCSGQzTlhNV0F2dUc2M19Xd3pFbktaUEE3U19fUWU4V0FYdnNLbGhOWUFIbmotWTdaMTRQRWdRdEhQdGNLTlBCNllsYm9EbTdleFBwNjFSQUozYjFZWHZ4clVxMlJIRFdZM1d5c3R3aVR3b29CaDJ1OTFocw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;As if you needed another reason to envy—or loathe—morning people. Research this week shows that people who go to bed early are more likely to be physically active than those who crave the night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at Monash University in Australia led the study, which objectively examined people’s sleeping and exercise habits. Compared to late-night and typical sleepers, people who went to bed early tended to perform more physical activity the following day, they found. The findings also suggest that tweaking our bedtimes can indirectly help us stay more active, the researchers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Going to sleep earlier than usual may be an effective strategy to maintain normal sleep duration while also optimizing next-day [physical activity],” the authors wrote in their paper, &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2420846122"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regularly getting a good night’s sleep and exercising are both vital keys to better overall health. But according to the researchers, it’s still unclear exactly how these two aspects of our lives can interact with each other. The team was particularly interested in finding out whether the timing of people’s sleep can affect their exercise time, too.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;They analyzed data from two earlier studies that tracked people’s waking and non-waking activity via wearables. In the first study, roughly 20,000 participants wore an activity tracker for an entire year, meaning the researchers had data covering roughly six million nights of sleeping. Across the whole sample, people’s average bedtime was around 11 p.m. Early sleepers were classified as people who turned in for bed around 9 p.m., whereas late sleepers went to bed around 1 a.m.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compared to late sleepers, early birds clocked 30 more minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity on average, the researchers found; they also exercised about 15 minutes more than the typical sleeper. These patterns remained stable when the researchers analyzed data from the second study that involved almost 6,000 people who wore FitBits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Though the study isn’t intended to answer why night owls might exercise less, the researchers have their educated guesses.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Standard 9-to-5 routines can clash with the natural sleep preferences of evening types, leading to social jetlag, poorer sleep quality, and increased daytime sleepiness—which can all reduce motivation and opportunity for physical activity the next day,” said lead author Josh Leota, a scientist at Monash’s Sleep and Circadian Rhythms research program, in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1089146"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our sleeping habits are influenced by many factors that aren’t easily adjusted, including the hours we work and our genetics. But there might be some hope for late birds who would like to exercise more. The researchers also found that people who slept earlier than their typical time, while still sleeping the same amount of hours as usual, tended to perform more physical activity the next day. In other words, it should be possible to work on our sleep and get more workout time all at once. And the researchers say that public health groups should try to emphasize both if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Rather than just promoting sleep and physical activity independently, health campaigns could encourage earlier bedtimes to naturally foster more active lifestyles. A holistic approach that recognizes how these two essential behaviors interact may lead to better outcomes for individual and community health,” said Leota.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I’m all for getting more beauty rest and gym time. But I will draw the line at 5 a.m. morning runs, just FYI.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

        A 61-year-old became critically ill weeks after a successful kidney transplant and revealed the kidney was infected with parasitic worms.

    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="trinityAudioPlaceholder trinity-player-iframe-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten weeks after a New England man received a kidney transplant, he went into respiratory failure and shock — thanks to an extensive parasitic worm infection, according to his medical team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 61-year-old man &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMcpc2412510?logout=true" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;received a new kidney from a deceased donor&lt;/a&gt; after being diagnosed with “nephrosclerosis-related end-stage kidney disease,” or chronic high blood pressure that causes hardening of the walls of arteries in the kidneys, according to a June 18 case report published in the Case Records of the Massachusetts General Hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transplant was successful and the man was sent home with care instructions just four days later, doctors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-101" class="zone zone-el" index="2" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six weeks later, the man attended a follow-up visit where doctors saw a slightly elevated creatinine level and hyperglycemia, the former an indicator of kidney function and the latter indicative of diabetes, according to the report. He was sent home with a weekly injection of semaglutide, the active ingredient in drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then his health took a turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Successful transplant turns critical&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week later, the 61-year-old was scratched by his cat and his ankle began to swell, doctors said. He started to feel tired and nauseated the next week, then started throwing up and drinking excessive amounts of water, according to the case report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was admitted to the hospital again, and over the next ten days, his heart rate increased significantly, his breathing decreased until he needed to be put on a ventilator, doctors said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hoping for answers, his medical team turned to his previous medical history for something that might have been missed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 61-year-old had been on the transplant list for 6 years, according to the report, and he had diabetes and spent much of his life as a smoker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had lived in New England his entire life and hadn’t traveled. He enjoyed gardening, and had healthy cats and a dog at home with his wife. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the rash appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purple and blotchy, the rash stretched across his stomach as his abdomen grew to become large and hard, and normal bowel sounds were absent, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By this point, the man was described as “critically ill,” and because the man was on immunodepressants to help his body transition to the new organ, doctors compared the man’s symptoms to other examples of infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-106" class="zone zone-el" index="13" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Given that the patient’s presentation is not consistent with a drug reaction or rejection of the kidney allograft, I think that the most likely explanation for his critical illness is a disseminated parasitic infection,” Camille N. Kotton, an &lt;a href="https://researchers.mgh.harvard.edu/profile/1248022/Camille-Kotton" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;infectious disease and transplant expert&lt;/a&gt;, wrote in the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man was diagnosed with “donor-derived disseminated strongyloidiasis,” or an infection caused by &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/strongyloidiasis/index.html" target="_blank" rel="Follow"&gt;parasitic roundworms,&lt;/a&gt; doctors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What are roundworms?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="photo-inline-"&gt;                      &lt;div class="img-container picture "&gt;            &lt;picture&gt;                                                &lt;source srcset="https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/r2t3wd/picture309856465/alternates/FREE_1140/GettyImages-1318877833.jpg" media="(min-width: 992px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/r2t3wd/picture309856465/alternates/FREE_960/GettyImages-1318877833.jpg" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/r2t3wd/picture309856465/alternates/FREE_768/GettyImages-1318877833.jpg" media="(min-width: 601px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/r2t3wd/picture309856465/alternates/FREE_640/GettyImages-1318877833.jpg" media="(min-width: 441px)"&gt;                &lt;source srcset="https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/r2t3wd/picture309856465/alternates/FREE_480/GettyImages-1318877833.jpg" media="(min-width: 320px)"&gt;                                                &lt;img class="responsive-image" srcset="https://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/r2t3wd/picture309856465/alternates/FREE_1140/GettyImages-1318877833.jpg" alt="Strongyloides are a parasitic roundworm and were spread to the man through a donated kidney." title="GettyImages-1318877833.jpg" loading="lazy"&gt;                            &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;                            &lt;figcaption&gt;                                            Strongyloides are a parasitic roundworm and were spread to the man through a donated kidney.                                                                                                                                                                        &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images/iStock Photo&lt;/span&gt;                                                            &lt;/figcaption&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-107" class="zone zone-el" index="17" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The roundworms, also called threadworms, can infect humans directly, but can also be passed to humans through contact with monkeys or domestic dogs, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this man’s case, the source of the infection was his new kidney, donated from someone who lived in the Caribbean before their death and who had not been tested for strongyloides before the donation, according to the case report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2008 and 2017, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, the group that oversees organ donation in the United States, reported 14 out of 10,000 organ donations could result in disease transmission, or about 0.14% of donations, doctors said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-108" class="zone zone-el" index="20" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, many of these events are varied and unexpected, involving a long list of pathogens ranging from viruses to bacteria and parasites,” doctors wrote. “Although we have contemplated how to avoid such transmissions, many seem unavoidable and result in undesirable circumstances.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man was successfully treated with ivermectin, an antiparasitic drug, and doctors contacted the organ board to see if any other patients had received organs from the same donor, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 66-year-old man had received the donor’s other kidney, doctors said, and his medical team was contacted to begin treatment for the infection after he had already been showing similar symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="zone-el-109" class="zone zone-el" index="23" issportsarticle="false" stnplayerkill="true" allowstnplayer="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both men fully recovered and their transplants were successful, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medical team includes Kotton, Rory L.

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IN A NUTSHELL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🧠 &lt;strong&gt;StateViewer&lt;/strong&gt; is a cutting-edge AI tool developed by Mayo Clinic, capable of diagnosing nine types of dementia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;📈 The tool analyzes &lt;strong&gt;FDG-PET scans&lt;/strong&gt; and provides color-coded brain maps for easy interpretation by clinicians.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🌍 With a global dementia burden affecting over &lt;strong&gt;55 million people&lt;/strong&gt;, StateViewer offers a scalable diagnostic solution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔬 The tool boasts an impressive &lt;strong&gt;88% accuracy rate&lt;/strong&gt; and significantly improves diagnostic speed and precision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking development, Mayo Clinic researchers have unveiled an innovative AI tool called &lt;strong&gt;StateViewer&lt;/strong&gt;, capable of diagnosing nine types of dementia using just one common brain scan. This technological marvel promises to revolutionize dementia diagnosis by providing faster and more accurate results than traditional methods. The significance of this tool lies in its potential to transform how clinicians approach dementia, offering hope for millions affected by these debilitating conditions. By leveraging sophisticated machine learning algorithms, StateViewer stands at the forefront of medical technology, paving the way for a future where early and precise diagnosis is within reach for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Understanding StateViewer’s Advanced Capabilities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The StateViewer tool operates by analyzing a &lt;strong&gt;fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan&lt;/strong&gt;, which highlights how the brain utilizes glucose—a critical marker of brain activity. By comparing these scans to an extensive database of confirmed dementia cases, the AI can identify distinct patterns associated with various dementia types. For example, &lt;strong&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/strong&gt; affects memory and cognitive processing areas, while &lt;strong&gt;Lewy body dementia&lt;/strong&gt; targets regions involved in attention and motor functions. &lt;strong&gt;Frontotemporal dementia&lt;/strong&gt;, on the other hand, impacts language and behavior-related areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StateViewer presents its findings through &lt;i&gt;color-coded brain maps&lt;/i&gt;, enabling even general clinicians to grasp complex dementia patterns visually. Dr. David Jones, a neurologist at the Mayo Clinic, emphasized the tool’s capacity to simplify the diagnostic process, allowing for more informed treatment decisions. “Every patient who walks into my clinic carries a unique story shaped by the brain’s complexity,” Dr. Jones noted, underscoring the tool’s potential to transform patient care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tackling the Growing Dementia Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With over &lt;strong&gt;55 million people worldwide&lt;/strong&gt; living with dementia and 10 million new cases annually, the burden of this condition is immense. Alzheimer’s disease alone ranks as the fifth-leading cause of death globally. Traditional diagnostic methods for dementia involve a battery of tests, including cognitive assessments, imaging, and consultations, making the process arduous and time-consuming. Despite these efforts, accurately distinguishing between overlapping dementia types remains challenging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jones, in collaboration with AI engineer Leland Barnard, recognized the urgent need for a more efficient diagnostic tool. “As we were designing StateViewer, we never lost sight of the fact that behind every data point and brain scan was a person facing a difficult diagnosis and urgent questions,” Barnard reflected. Their work highlights the critical role machine learning can play in enhancing clinical medicine by providing real-time insights and guidance to physicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Potential of StateViewer in Clinical Settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StateViewer’s introduction marks a significant step forward in the fight against dementia, offering a scalable solution that could democratize expert-level diagnostic support. The technology has been rigorously tested across &lt;strong&gt;3,600 brain scans&lt;/strong&gt;, demonstrating an impressive 88% accuracy rate in identifying the correct type of dementia. This represents a threefold increase in diagnostic accuracy compared to standard workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayo Clinic researchers are optimistic about expanding StateViewer’s use across diverse clinical environments. By doing so, they hope to facilitate earlier interventions and improve patient outcomes significantly. The tool’s success in various settings could redefine the treatment landscape for dementia, providing a model for integrating AI into everyday clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Looking to the Future of Dementia Diagnosis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As StateViewer continues to evolve, its potential impact on healthcare is profound. By enabling quicker and more precise diagnoses, the tool offers hope for earlier intervention and treatment, potentially altering the progression of these diseases. The study’s publication in the journal &lt;strong&gt;Neurology&lt;/strong&gt; underscores the tool’s scientific credibility and its promise in reshaping dementia care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As new treatments for dementia emerge, tools like StateViewer will be crucial in ensuring timely and accurate diagnoses. This innovation raises an important question: &lt;i&gt;How will AI-driven diagnostics reshape our approach to complex medical conditions in the years to come?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p class="nih-pretitle"&gt;&lt;span class="usa-tag usa-tag--gray"&gt;Media Advisory&lt;/span&gt;  Wednesday, July 2, 2025&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;h1&gt;NIH study links particulate air pollution to increased mutations in lung cancers among nonsmokers&lt;/h1&gt;
                  &lt;p class="nih-subtitle"&gt;Whole-genome sequencing study found air pollution to cause more cancer-related changes than secondhand smoke.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;h3&gt;What&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and their colleagues at the University of California, San Diego, have found that fine-particulate air pollution, which includes pollution from vehicles and industry, was strongly associated with increased genomic changes in lung cancer tumors among people who have never smoked. By assembling the largest-ever whole-genome analysis of lung cancer in individuals who have never smoked, researchers were able to link air pollution exposure to increased cancer-driving and cancer-promoting genetic mutations. This could potentially lead to more prevention strategies for never-smokers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed lung tumors from 871 never-smoker patients across 28 geographic locations worldwide as part of the &lt;a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/cancer-types/lung/sherlock-lung-study"&gt;Sherlock-Lung study&lt;/a&gt;. They found associations between air pollution exposure and changes in the &lt;em&gt;TP53&lt;/em&gt; gene, and other genetic mutational signatures previously associated with tobacco smoking. They also observed a relationship between air pollution and shorter telomeres, which are sections of DNA found at the end of chromosomes. Telomeres shorten naturally with age and shorter telomeres are related to cells inability to continue to replicate. However, scientists found fine particulate air pollution was linked to premature shortening of telomeres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior genomic studies of lung cancer have focused on tobacco smokers, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of how lung cancer develops in people who have never used tobacco. By beginning to uncover the mechanisms through which tissues acquire cancer-causing or cancer-promoting mutations following environmental exposures, this study helps scientists better understand the primary drivers of lung cancer in this population—which represents up to 25% of all lung cancer cases globally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the researchers found that while exposure to secondhand smoke was associated with slightly higher mutation burdens and shorter telomeres, compared to tumors in patients who were not exposed, it did not lead to an increase in cancer-driving mutations or mutational signatures. This suggests that secondhand smoke may have a lower overall ability to cause genetic mutations, known as mutagenicity, compared to air pollution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This work was led by researchers at NIH’s National Cancer Institute and the University of California, San Diego, and published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; on July 2, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
