Five had brain tumors, all of which are benign. Two of those have the most common, benign type — meningioma, according to the hospital in Newton, Massachusetts, which is about 10 miles west of Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The investigation found no environmental risks which could be linked to the development of a brain tumor,” the hospital’s Jonathan Sonis, associate chief medical officer, and Sandy Muse, chief nursing officer, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The hospital said its investigation was completed in collaboration with government health and safety officials and it considered multiple possible sources. It ruled out disposable masks, the water supply, nearby x-rays, and chemotherapy treatment on the floor below, the hospital said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Based on these results, we can confidently reassure our dedicated team ... and all our patients that there is no environmental risk at our facility," the administrators said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="styles_inlineImage__FvnTh styles_medium__MEKii"&gt;&lt;picture class="styles_image__i32F7" data-testid="picture"&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 1000px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/250404-newton-mass-general-brigham-newton-wellesley-hospital-google-ac-754p-6d4eef.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250404-newton-mass-general-brigham-newton-wellesley-hospital-google-ac-754p-6d4eef.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source media="(min-width: 320px)" srcset="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_avif,q_auto:eco,dpr_2/rockcms/2025-04/250404-newton-mass-general-brigham-newton-wellesley-hospital-google-ac-754p-6d4eef.jpg 2x, https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250404-newton-mass-general-brigham-newton-wellesley-hospital-google-ac-754p-6d4eef.jpg 1x"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-04/250404-newton-mass-general-brigham-newton-wellesley-hospital-google-ac-754p-6d4eef.jpg" alt="Mass General Brigham Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Newton, Mass"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption styles_caption__TCewG" data-testid="caption"&gt;&lt;span class="caption__container" data-testid="caption__container"&gt;An exterior of Mass General Brigham Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Newton, Mass.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="caption__source" data-testid="caption__source"&gt;Google Maps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The Massachusetts Nurses Association, the union that bargains for nurses' compensation at Newton-Wellesley Hospital, said it will continue to investigate.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;"Right now, the best way we can help is to complete an independent, scientific investigation," MNA spokesperson Joe Markman said in a statement Friday.

Fifty-six people have been hospitalized in the area since the disease started spreading in late January. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At the Tiny Tots U Learning Academy, a center with approximately 230 infants, toddlers and preschool-age children, the outbreak began on March 24, when a little girl who had been sick with fever and vomiting tested positive. She later needed to be hospitalized for pneumonia and trouble breathing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kids who have tested positive at the day care so far are between the ages of 5 months and 3 years old, said Maegan Messick, a co-owner of the center. None was fully vaccinated against measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;For nearly two weeks, Messick has been working with local health officials who are in contact with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the situation. Messick said she’s not been given clear guidance on how to handle measles in such a large day care with so many vulnerable kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“From what I’m being told, the CDC doesn’t have a playbook for this,” Messick said. “We’ve just had to make judgment calls.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The U.S. is facing the largest measles outbreak in six years, but the CDC has remained relatively silent on the public health threat, providing just weekly updates on its website and sending &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00522.html" target="_blank"&gt;an alert to doctors&lt;/a&gt; last month. The agency sent 2,000 doses of the MMR vaccine to Texas health officials at their request, but hasn't held a news briefing about measles since 2019, when &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/u-s-measles-count-rises-764-driven-new-york-outbreaks-n1002311https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/u-s-measles-count-rises-764-driven-new-york-outbreaks-n1002311" target="_blank"&gt;two large outbreaks in New York&lt;/a&gt; threatened to reverse the United States’ status of having eliminated the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, which is over CDC, did not respond Friday to a question about whether any briefings were in the works to address the current measles outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It was unclear whether mass layoffs at HHS and CDC this week might stymie such efforts. But &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-pulling-back-11b-covid-funding-sent-health-departments-us-rcna198006" target="_blank"&gt;steep funding cuts to community health departments&lt;/a&gt; announced last week have already forced some areas to cancel vaccine clinics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/texas-measles-outbreak-dallas-vaccines-hhs-funding-cuts-rcna199144" target="_blank"&gt;Dallas County&lt;/a&gt;, for example, had to cancel more than 50 clinics. Many had been planned for schools in areas with low vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;According to an NBC News tally, 628 measles cases have been reported nationally in 2025. Other states with outbreaks include Kansas with 23 cases, Oklahoma with 10 cases, and New Mexico with 54 cases. Public health officials in Ohio have identified 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The cases at the Lubbock day care center are likely linked to the epicenter of the outbreak, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreak-west-texas-grows-unvaccinated-rcna192163" target="_blank"&gt;Gaines County&lt;/a&gt;, said Lubbock's public health director Katherine Wells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Wells said she’s been concerned about cases spreading in child care centers since the beginning of the outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I think we’ll have additional outbreaks in other day care centers,” she said. “This isn’t going to be the only one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Messick, of the Tiny Tots U Learning Academy, said she and her staff are trying to reduce risk of further spread by watching kids closely for symptoms and isolating certain classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;They’re also urging other child care facilities to encourage their families to get the MMR vaccine. Families who choose not to vaccinate their children have been asked to keep them home for at least 21 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Two doses are almost always enough to give lifetime protection against measles, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;.

These immune cells, known as T regulatory cells (T-regs), are located in the meninges and produce the painkilling molecule enkephalin in response to hormonal signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect appears specific to females, offering insight into why some pain treatments work better for women and why postmenopausal women may experience more chronic pain. This newly uncovered mechanism could lead to sex-specific therapies and innovative treatments for the millions affected by chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hormone-Driven Relief:&lt;/strong&gt; Estrogen and progesterone prompt T-regs to release natural opioids.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sex-Specific Response:&lt;/strong&gt; Female mice without T-regs became more pain-sensitive; males did not.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Engineered T-regs may offer a new approach for chronic pain relief.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCSF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scientists have discovered a new mechanism that acts via an immune cell and points toward a different way of treating chronic pain. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Female hormones can suppress pain by making immune cells near the spinal cord produce opioids, a new study from researchers at UC San Francisco has found. This stops pain signals before they get to the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery could help with developing new treatments for chronic pain. It may also explain why some painkillers work better for women than men and why postmenopausal women experience more pain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108393"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman in pain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/estrogen-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers have begun looking into the possibility of engineering T-regs to produce enkephalin on a constant basis in both men and women. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The work reveals an entirely new role for T regulatory immune cells (T-regs), which are known for their ability to reduce inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fact that there’s a sex-dependent influence on these cells – driven by estrogen and progesterone – and that it’s not related at all to any immune function is very unusual,” said Elora Midavaine, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow. She is the first author of the study, which was funded in part by the National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears April 4 in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at T-regs in the protective layers that encase the brain and spinal cord in mice. Until now, scientists thought these tissues, called the meninges, only served to protect the central nervous system and eliminate waste. T-regs were only discovered there in recent years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What we are showing now is that the immune system actually uses the meninges to communicate with distant neurons that detect sensation on the skin,” said Sakeen Kashem, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of dermatology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is something we hadn’t known before.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That communication begins when a neuron, often near the skin, senses something that could cause pain. The neuron then sends a signal to the spinal cord.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team found that the meninges surrounding the lower part of the spinal cord harbor an abundance of T-regs. To learn what their function was, the researchers knocked the cells out with a toxin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect was striking: Without the T-regs, female mice became more sensitive to pain, while male mice did not. This sex-specific difference suggested that female mice rely more on T-regs to manage pain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was both fascinating and puzzling,” said Kashem, who co-led the study with Allan Basbaum, PhD. “It actually made me skeptical initially.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further experiments revealed a relationship between T-regs and female hormones that no one had seen before: Estrogen and progesterone were prompting the cells to churn out painkilling enkephalin.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly how the hormones do this is a question the team hopes to answer in a future study. But even without that understanding, the awareness of this sex-dependent pathway is likely to lead to much-needed new approaches for treating pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the short run, it may help physicians choose medications that could be more effective for a patient, depending on their sex. Certain migraine treatments, for example, are known to work better on women than men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could be particularly helpful for women who have gone through menopause and no longer produce estrogen and progesterone, many of whom experience chronic pain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers have begun looking into the possibility of engineering T-regs to produce enkephalin on a constant basis in both men and women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If that approach is successful, it could really change the lives of the nearly 20% of Americans who experience chronic pain that is not adequately treated,” Basbaum said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authors:&lt;/strong&gt; Other authors on the study include Beatriz Moraes, Jorge Benitez, Sian Rodriguez, Joao Braz, Nathan Kochhar and Walter Eckalbar of UCSF, Lin Tian of the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience, Ana Domingos of University of Oxford and John E.

&lt;p&gt;Experiencing Cloudflare’s “Attention Required!” message can be frustrating when trying to access leboudoirdubienetre.fr. This security feature, while protecting websites from potential threats, sometimes blocks legitimate users. Understanding why this happens and knowing how to resolve these access issues can save you time and restore your browsing experience.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-1"&gt;Understanding Cloudflare security alerts&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare serves as a protective shield for many websites including leboudoirdubienetre.fr. When you encounter an “Attention Required!” notification, it means the security system has identified your action as potentially suspicious. This doesn’t necessarily indicate malicious intent on your part – even routine browsing activities can sometimes trigger these alerts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-in-text" id="think-328903103"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="7418520743" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The security system analyzes visitor behavior patterns to detect possible threats. Actions that might trigger the security mechanism include submitting certain keywords, phrases that resemble SQL commands, or data in unexpected formats. Even browsing patterns that appear automated can activate these protective measures, temporarily restricting your access to the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/04/03/this-little-known-leafy-vegetable-is-actually-the-secret-to-youth-among-the-japanese-and-koreans/"&gt;

                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;This little-known leafy vegetable is actually the secret to youth among the Japanese and Koreans.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These security protocols represent part of a broader strategy for maintaining website integrity. Just as &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/03/04/at-24-she-reveals-how-she-saved-90000-to-retire-by-40/"&gt;financial planning requires protective measures&lt;/a&gt; to safeguard assets, websites implement these barriers to protect their digital infrastructure from potential threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="think-display-adsense-2" id="think-389191795"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="7418520743" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding that these blocks are automated rather than personal can help reduce frustration when encountering them. The system operates on predefined security rules without human intervention in most cases, which occasionally results in false positives.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-2"&gt;Common triggers for security blocks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several factors can trigger Cloudflare’s security mechanisms when attempting to access leboudoirdubienetre.fr. Identifying what might have caused the block can help you avoid similar issues in the future. Security systems often flag activities that deviate from typical user behavior patterns.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific phrases or keywords within your search queries or form submissions may activate security alerts. The system monitors for expressions commonly associated with hacking attempts or automated scraping tools. Similarly, any input resembling database commands will immediately trigger protective measures, as these often indicate potential SQL injection attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/03/26/the-worlds-richest-youtuber-mrbeast-says-anyone-would-be-unhappy-living-the-lifestyle-he-has/"&gt;
                        &lt;span class="label dynamic"&gt;Well being&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;The world’s richest YouTuber, MrBeast, says anyone would be “unhappy” living the lifestyle he has.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rapid page requests or browsing multiple pages quickly can appear suspicious to security algorithms. The system may interpret this behavior as bot activity rather than human browsing. Even using certain browser extensions or VPN services can sometimes trigger these security responses.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your IP address history also plays a role in determining access permissions. If your network has previously been associated with suspicious activities, even unrelated to your personal actions, you might face additional scrutiny. This shared responsibility approach to network security resembles how &lt;a href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/02/02/this-is-the-exact-amount-of-exercise-you-need-per-week-to-effectively-lose-weight/"&gt;consistent exercise habits contribute to overall health goals&lt;/a&gt; – both require ongoing vigilance and proper practices.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-3"&gt;Steps to resolve access restrictions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When faced with the “Attention Required!” message on leboudoirdubienetre.fr, several practical solutions can help restore your access quickly. The most direct approach involves communicating with the website administrators about the issue you’re experiencing.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contact the site owner via email to explain the situation. Include detailed information about what you were doing when the block occurred. This context helps them determine whether the security system responded appropriately or if adjustments are needed. Remember to include the Cloudflare Ray ID displayed at the bottom of the error page, as this specific identifier helps administrators trace exactly what triggered the security response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/03/20/a-nutritionist-reveals-the-exact-amount-of-dark-chocolate-to-eat-daily-to-reap-its-benefits/"&gt;

                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;A nutritionist reveals the exact amount of dark chocolate to eat daily to reap its benefits.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While waiting for a response, try some basic troubleshooting steps. Clear your browser cookies and cache, which might remove any data patterns that triggered the security alert. Switching to a different browser or disabling browser extensions can also help determine if these factors contributed to the block.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re using a VPN service, temporarily disabling it might resolve the issue. Security systems sometimes flag traffic from VPN servers due to their shared nature and previous user activities. Waiting a short period before attempting to access the site again can also be effective, as temporary blocks often reset automatically after a cooling-off period.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="toc-title-4"&gt;Preventive measures for smooth website access&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Taking proactive steps can significantly reduce your chances of encountering Cloudflare security blocks when visiting leboudoirdubienetre.fr or similar protected websites. Implementing these practices helps establish your browsing activities as legitimate and trustworthy to security systems.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enable cookies for websites you regularly visit. Security systems often use cookies to distinguish between legitimate users and potential threats. Blocking cookies might prevent the site from recognizing you as a returning visitor, potentially triggering security measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="related-article simple" href="https://thinkstewartville.com/2025/03/10/better-than-nordic-walking-this-grandpa-sport-is-perfect-for-burning-fat-with-minimal-effort/"&gt;
                        &lt;span class="label dynamic"&gt;Well being&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class="title"&gt;Better than Nordic walking, this “grandpa sport” is perfect for burning fat with minimal effort.&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" class="icon icon-chevron-right" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewbox="0 0 384 512" fill="currentColor"&gt;&lt;path d="M342.6 233.4c12.5 12.5 12.5 32.8 0 45.3l-192 192c-12.5 12.5-32.8 12.5-45.3 0s-12.5-32.8 0-45.3L274.7 256 105.4 86.6c-12.5-12.5-12.5-32.8 0-45.3s32.8-12.5 45.3 0l192 192z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;
                        &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Avoid rapid page refreshing or unusual browsing patterns that might appear automated. Navigate through websites at a natural pace, similar to how you would read content offline. Be cautious when submitting forms or search queries containing technical terminology that might resemble code or commands.



&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping your devices free from malware provides another layer of protection against security blocks. Infected devices might exhibit suspicious behavior patterns without your knowledge.

The deaths — all occurring within the first few months of 2025 — mark an unusual spike in &lt;a href="https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/what-is-hantavirus-the-infection-that-killed-20209371.php" data-link="native" class=""&gt;hantavirus &lt;/a&gt;activity and have raised alarm among public health experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A third case of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS), each of which has been fatal, is tragic and alarming,” said Dr. Tom Boo, a Mono County public health officer, in a &lt;a href="https://monocounty.ca.gov/sites/default/files/fileattachments/county_administration/page/34452/pr_mono_thirdhantavirus_4-3-25_final.pdf" data-link="native" class=""&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. “We don’t have a clear sense of where this young adult may have contracted the virus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="A300" data-large-id="Inline-1" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases occurred despite no major rodent infestations in the homes of the three deceased, all who lived and worked in Mammoth Lakes, the release said. In each case, health officials did find mice in the workplace, which they don’t consider to be unusual, though no definitive exposure site has been confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We should pay attention to the presence of mice and be careful around their waste,” Boo said, noting that these recent deaths did not involve the typical risk factors, such as cleaning enclosed spaces with visible droppings, that have previously been associated with infection. He said he’s also “worried” about the timing of the deaths since hantavirus cases usually come in late spring or summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hantavirus is contracted by inhaling particles from the droppings, urine, or saliva of infected deer mice, a species common in the Eastern Sierra, the release said. The virus does not spread from person to person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the California Department of Public Health, 93 state residents have been infected with hantavirus from 1980 through 2024, with 79 of those cases traced to specific exposure locations within California. Mono County has recorded 27 cases since 1993 — more than any other county in the state — including six involving visitors, health officials said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md:pt16 md:sy16 md:bb md:bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class="vh y0 mb0 md:vv md:y100 md:mb16"&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="NTV7ARD" data-large-id="Inline-2" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hantavirus begins with flu-like symptoms such as fever, body aches, nausea, and abdominal pain. A cough usually develops only later, and shortness of breath often signaling the onset of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. The disease can progress rapidly, with death occurring within one to two days of respiratory decline in severe cases, and roughly one-third of infected individuals die, the Mono County release said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The illness made national headlines earlier this year when Betsy Arakawa — the wife of actor Gene Hackman — died from hantavirus in their New Mexico home. Hackman reportedly died days later from unrelated causes, including heart disease and Alzheimer’s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials urge residents to take precautions: Seal up any holes larger than a pencil’s width to prevent mouse entry, store food in rodent-proof containers and never vacuum or sweep droppings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="Inline-1" data-large-id="Inline-3" data-unit="hnp-sfgate.com/article_dtc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, contaminated areas should be aired out for at least 30 minutes, then sprayed with disinfectant or a 10% bleach solution and wiped clean while wearing gloves and an N-95 mask.

The World Health Organization said last week that cases in Mexico were linked to the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt; outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that is airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/08/texas-mmr-vaccine-measles-outbreak" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2000 had been declared eliminated from the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The outbreak in Texas began more than two months ago. State health officials said on Friday there were 59 new cases of measles since Tuesday, bringing the total to 481 across 19 counties – most of them in west Texas. The state also logged 14 new hospitalizations, for a total of 56 throughout the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;More than 65% of the Texas cases are in Gaines county, which has a population of 22,892, and where the virus stated spreading in a close-knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community. The county now has logged 315 cases since late January – just over 1% of the county’s residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 20:43:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTFB3RHpqbkRlYldYQkJZbTRMdU1kSlEyNmlXSTR4XzVjZ3pmdHM4MHo0eWVhOExfZzFTVUZTOHNPTEhaZWdEVFQ1YjhQS3V3R0dGNzdRZDlQbmt4VVJOS3c5elhZRlE4Y1Q5TWRCNmRaSWJnQzhkcnJZ</guid></item><item><title>Scientists Just Discovered a Huge Health Benefit of Blueberries - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMigAFBVV95cUxNSnpjX1VVTVJYVW9EX2VjQkwwQmF2cllybExVUncwdElYUEtUWWo3b1hMVVJhY2M2YTlVQnhhSVZKNHdHUUI2VE9vR3VOdG9pZzRqZFRDanVkeUtMYXR6SThGQV9hdmhNNUNSR2xaVnVpeFBYRmZQczhNV1JITDJYZA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-blockquote" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Many people are already aware that eating blueberries and other &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-antioxidant-rich-vegetables-for-diabetes-8678207" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;foods rich in antioxidants&lt;/a&gt; is a simple and effective way to support different aspects of our health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Blueberries are rich in polyphenols, especially anthocyanins, which not only give them vibrant color but also support heart health by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. These compounds improve blood vessel function, help &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/myths-about-high-cholesterol-to-stop-believing-8760519" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;balance cholesterol levels&lt;/a&gt; and lower risks related to heart and metabolic diseases.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;the gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, which plays a crucial role in overall health, can be positively influenced by the polyphenols in blueberries.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A new study published in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; explored how the simple act of adding blueberry powder to the diet can impact gut bacteria and blood markers connected to heart health in older adults who are overweight or have obesity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Having a better idea of what may happen when older adults simply &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-lemon-blueberry-dessert-recipes-11701396" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;eat more blueberries&lt;/a&gt; can help uncover new strategies to improve gut health and reduce the risk of heart-related issues with little effort.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study, called The Blueberry Enhances Activity and Cognition Through Increased Vascular Efficiency (BEACTIVE) study, was a 12-week research trial that investigated how eating blueberries and exercising could benefit older adults' physical activity and brain health. The study included men and women over 60 years old who were not very active and had a body weight that ranged between overweight and moderately obese. Participants also needed to have normal heart rhythms and blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg. People with certain health conditions, recent infections, or who were on specific medications were not included in the study.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A total of 55 participants were selected and randomly divided into two groups. One group consumed a drink made from blueberry powder twice daily, while the other group consumed a similar-looking placebo drink. Both groups also followed an exercise routine. By the end of the study, 48 participants completed the program. The amount of blueberry powder consumed was a quantity equivalent to about 1 1/2 cups of blueberries each day, divided into two ¾ cup servings consumed with meals.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; At the beginning of the study, participants' diets were analyzed to understand their nutrition and berry intake using online tools and questionnaires. To ensure a clear understanding of how the treatment worked, participants followed a two-week "washout" period before the study began, where they avoided eating berries, grapes, cherries and other foods high in specific nutrients found in berries. Every participant also wore a fitness tracker for a week to measure their daily steps, and they gradually increased their step count throughout the study, working towards being more active.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-the-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did The Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Looking at cholesterol, fats and other important compounds in the blood after 12 weeks, researchers found that people taking the placebo powder experienced significantly lower total cholesterol, LDL (called “bad”) cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol. Markers for the number and size of LDL particles and a protein linked to cholesterol, ApoB, also significantly decreased. On the other hand, people taking blueberry powder had lower levels of total HDL particles (the "good" cholesterol) and a protein called ApoA-I linked to HDL. In other words, they experienced positive outcomes when it came to their heart health.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When comparing the two groups, additional differences were noted. For the group on blueberry powder, there were changes in specific cholesterol particle numbers and sizes, such as smaller LDL cholesterol particles in the fasting state and lower levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol and other markers after meals, known as the postprandial state.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Overall, this study shows how additions like blueberry powder can impact cholesterol and related blood markers differently compared to a placebo.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study also found that among the study subjects, eating a diet that included powdered blueberries led to an increase in a specific type of gut bacteria called &lt;em&gt;Coriobacteriales incertae sedis&lt;/em&gt;. This increase wasn’t seen in those who didn’t consume the blueberry powder. These bacteria are known to help break down and absorb beneficial compounds found in blueberries, suggesting that the body adapts to better digest the nutrients from blueberries when they are a regular part of the diet, per the study authors. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study has some important limitations to consider. One major one was the small size of the groups that had both gut microbiome data and advanced blood biomarker analysis. Since the sample size is so small, it limits the ability to generalize the findings to a broader population.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The authors also note that while the placebo and treatment groups were well-matched in terms of age, gender, race and BMI, they noticed that the placebo group showed different responses, which could be due to participants changing their behavior because they knew they were part of a health study. This might explain some of the positive effects seen in the placebo group. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s also worth noting that this study was funded by the U.S. Highbush Blueberry Council.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For those of us looking for ways to support our heart health, adding blueberries is a delicious and simple place to start. Whether it’s tossing a handful of fresh or frozen &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/anti-inflammatory-lemon-blueberry-smoothie-8363288" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;blueberries into a morning smoothie&lt;/a&gt;, sprinkling &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/8026653/blueberry-baked-oatmeal/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;them on oatmeal&lt;/a&gt; or enjoying them as a midday snack, these little berries pack a big punch when it comes to supporting heart and gut health. Knowing that such an easy swap can offer measurable benefits, especially for older adults or those looking to manage their cholesterol or improve their gut microbiota make up, makes incorporating blueberries into daily routines a no-brainer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What’s particularly encouraging about this study is its emphasis on accessibility and minimal effort. Unlike drastic lifestyle overhauls or invasive health interventions, eating more blueberries is a scalable practice that can fit into nearly any diet. It’s also a great reminder that small, consistent dietary changes can yield meaningful health benefits over time. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_46-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A recent study in &lt;em&gt;Nutrients&lt;/em&gt; highlights the impressive health benefits of adding blueberries to your diet, particularly for older adults aiming to support their heart and gut health. While more research is needed to fully understand the far-reaching implications, the evidence so far points to blueberries as a simple, enjoyable and fairly accessible way to improve overall well-being. Whether you’re looking to manage cholesterol levels, enhance gut microbiota, or simply enjoy a tasty snack with no added sugar, making blueberries a regular part of your diet is a step towards a healthier you.

						&lt;p&gt;A record 484 North Carolinians have died from the flu this year, and
that number will likely rise in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The number is the highest since the state
began reporting deaths in the 2008-2009 season. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
								&lt;p class="exco-player" feature="vendor.exco.player" id="d8af3f9c-ad37-4890-8ed5-bb0ce702acdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Deaths always lag several weeks behind the peaks of the
infection,” explained Dr. David Weber with UNC Health. “People start getting sick
and that’s when they measure when they test positive or come through the emergency
department, that’s the number you see peaking in mid-February. Then they take
several days or weeks to get really sick and they come to the hospital. While
we save many people, some people then go on and have a downhill course with
complications related to the flu.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://flu.ncdhhs.gov/data.htm"&gt;North Carolina’s
flu history&lt;/a&gt; has seen many fluctuations, including overall case and death totals
and when the virus itself peaks. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;At the end of the 2008-2009 flu season, 12 people had died
from the flu statewide. This season’s death toll is 3,933%
higher. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Prior to the 2024-2025 season, the highest death toll in a
single flu season was recorded in 2017-2018. 391 people died statewide that season.
&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt; The highest number of
pediatric deaths -- deaths of people under the age of 18 -- was recorded during last flu season, with 16 deaths. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/north-carolina-record-flu-deaths-april-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/north-carolina-record-flu-deaths-april-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;A review
of Immunization Registry records &lt;a href="https://epi.dph.ncdhhs.gov/cd/flu/figures/flu2324.pdf"&gt;showed that 75% of
those children were not vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;, according to
the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Weber said the high case counts this year can largely be
attributed to fewer social distancing protocols and fewer vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Many people are not masking the way they did in previous
years during the height of the COVID pandemic,” he said. “Second, the number of
people getting flu vaccines – as with other vaccines like the measles vaccine –
has decreased.” &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The infectious diseases expert said a common reason people
don’t get vaccinated is based on myth. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“I think the biggest reason people don’t get their annual
flu shot is they don’t perceive themselves as at-risk for serious illness and
think, ‘Oh I’m 20 and can’t get severely ill,'” said Weber. “That’s not true.
People can get sick and die from flu at any age.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/north-carolina-record-flu-deaths-april-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/north-carolina-record-flu-deaths-april-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The doctor shared people often “minimize the benefits of a
flu shot and over-consider the safety concerns” when it comes to their annual
vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Weber said he often equates vaccinations to wearing a
seatbelt. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Someone will say to me ‘I don’t want to wear a seatbelt
because I read about a car that got sideswiped and fell into a lake and the
seatbelt jammed and the person drowned.’ Has that happened? Yes. But for every
person where that’s happened, there are a thousand people walking around
healthy today because a seatbelt either saved their life or saved them from
severe injury,” he explained. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Flu vaccinations have been shown to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu-vaccines-work/benefits/index.html#:~:text=Reduce%20severity%20of%20illness&amp;amp;text=A%202021%20study%20showed%20that,with%20those%20who%20were%20unvaccinated."&gt;significantly
reduce risk of death and hospitalization&lt;/a&gt; due to serious illness.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Weber advised at-risk groups in particular to make a
plan to get their flu vaccine every year. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
								&lt;p id="nativo-0001"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0002"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p id="nativo-0003"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Anyone with underlying disease, that puts them at risk of
severe case of flu -- heart disease, lung disease, a smoker, asthma, people with
diabetes -- I think anyone if you’re 6 months of age and breathing
should get a flu shot period,” Weber said.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The doctor emphasized the importance of flu vaccinations for
pregnant women and those aged 65 or older.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“While the flu vaccine is not perfect and is usually about
50-70% effective in preventing disease, it is actually much better at
preventing death than hospitalization,” said Weber. “It may not prevent
everyone from getting ill, but it does a pretty good job of keeping you from
dying.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;When asked about future flu seasons, Weber said increasing
education and getting more people vaccinated is key. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“Each year the flu virus drifts a little bit, so each year we
make up a new flu vaccine to counter those small changes. We look at what
happens in the southern hemisphere – which is their winter, our summer – and
that’s how companies decide what to put in the vaccine drugs,” Weber explained.
“Every 5-20 years, we have a big shift; we get a new flu strain that’s totally
different, and we get a pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;

								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/north-carolina-record-flu-deaths-april-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Weber continued, “I can’t predict when there will be the
next flu pandemic, I can only tell you there will be a flu pandemic. It’s only
a matter of time based on what’s happened.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The doctor theorized H5N1 could have the potential to cause
serious sickness in humans, if the virus mutates further. Since 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/spotlights/h5n1-response-03192025.html#:~:text=Since%20April%202024%2C%2070%20human,H5N1)%20virus%2Dinfected%20poultry."&gt;70
human cases of bird flu have been reported in the United States&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“So far that particular strain of flu has not picked up the
characteristics that allow it go person-to-person, but that’s a big concern
that we could at any point – even this summer – have a pandemic that’s H5N1 for
which none of us have any immunity,” said Weber. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;The doctor said if the H5N1 virus does begin to jump from
human-to-human, a large spike in cases and bird-flu deaths would likely occur. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“If it doesn’t happen this summer, it’s only a matter of
time before we see another flu pandemic,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
								&lt;p class="opscoad-Mobile_In_Content" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/north-carolina-record-flu-deaths-april-2025"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
								&lt;p class="opscoad-article_in_read" data-unit="wral-v4/lifestyle/health/north-carolina-record-flu-deaths-april-2025/"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;To be prepared, Weber said North Carolinians need be
willing to make vaccinations more of a priority moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We need to support the companies to make the best flu
vaccine with the most current strains, and we need to take the vaccine, which
most people do not,” he said. “Separate from that, we need to support our
public health colleagues. Federal, state and local governments need to be
prepared for yet another pandemic. I know we all have pandemic fatigue, and we
don’t want to think about another one, but much like hurricanes, we’re going to
have them and we need to be prepared as a society for how to deal with them.”&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;Weber said that anyone with flu-like symptoms -- a high fever, dry cough, sore throat, body aches or runny nose -- should take an at-home test or be tested in a
healthcare setting quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;“We do have therapies for flu, but the flu advances so quickly
that you really need to start the therapy ideally within two days,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
						
							
							
							
						
					
						&lt;p&gt;If your condition worsens, seek emergency care immediately. &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;A supposed cure for measles is harming people in Texas. A children’s hospital in the area has reported that several children treated for measles have also developed vitamin A toxicity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The New York Times &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/25/health/measles-kennedy-vitamin-a.html"&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; on the phenomenon last week, and has since backed by further reports from &lt;a href="https://www.texasstandard.org/stories/west-texas-measles-outbreak-children-treated-vitamin-a-medical-disinformation/"&gt;local media outlets&lt;/a&gt;. The Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock, one of several counties in West Texas currently affected by measles, stated that it has treated fewer than 10 children with concurrent measles and vitamin A toxicity. Robert F. Kennedy, the head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has touted vitamin A as a measles treatment, despite little rationale for its use in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are several related outbreaks of measles ongoing in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and possibly &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/health/measles-kansas-multistate-outbreak/index.html"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, now totaling over 500 reported cases since January (the actual toll is likely higher). These outbreaks have largely been concentrated among pockets of unvaccinated people, and vaccination remains the most effective measure to contain the spread of this highly contagious disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;RFK Jr., a longtime and regularly debunked vaccine skeptic, has tepidly supported the use of vaccination during these outbreaks, but not without bringing up other worthless interventions. In early March, during a lengthy Fox News interview, Kennedy claimed that cod liver oil pills (rich in vitamin A), steroids, and antibiotics could be useful treatments for measles, for instance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Research has shown that measles can be severe in children with vitamin A deficiency, and the World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7076287/#:~:text=The%20World%20Health%20Organization%20(WHO)%20recommends%20a%20daily%20oral%20dose%20of%20vitamin%20A%20for%20two%20days%20to%20children%20with%20measles%20living%20in%20areas%20where%20vitamin%20A%20deficiency%20may%20be%20present."&gt;does recommend&lt;/a&gt; that doctors provide vitamin A to measles-infected children in regions where deficiency is common.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;But this deficiency is incredibly rare in the U.S. (perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK567744/#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%20(US,and%20low%20absorption.%5B17%5D"&gt;around 0.3%&lt;/a&gt; of the general population), and there is no evidence that cod liver oil itself can be beneficial for measles. The high doses sometimes used to treat measles could also cause toxicity if given carelessly, which seems to be exactly what’s happening with these cases. Too much vitamin A can cause &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532916/#:~:text=Prolonged%20and%20excessive%20vitamin%20A%20intake%20can%20result%20in%20significant%20organ%20damage%2C%20including%20the%20liver%2C%20bones%2C%20central%20nervous%20system%2C%20and%20skin.%20Liver%C2%A0fibrosis%20or%20cirrhosis%20may%20be%20irreversible."&gt;significant, even irreversible&lt;/a&gt; organ damage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There have been &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html"&gt;over 600 cases of measles&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. as of early April, including isolated, travel-related cases in 17 other states; 97% have involved people who were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. 74 people, mostly children, have been hospitalized. At least one person &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/measles-outbreak-in-texas-turns-deadly-as-parents-scramble-for-shots-2000568730"&gt;has died&lt;/a&gt; as a result, while officials in New Mexico are investigating a &lt;a href="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/alert/2025/3/?view=2188"&gt;second death&lt;/a&gt; that may have been connected to measles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;These cases and deaths were entirely preventable, thanks to a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/do-you-need-a-measles-booster-shot-the-answer-may-surprise-you-2000584301"&gt;highly effective and long-lasting vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. RFK’s support of vitamin A as a measles treatment is both wrongheaded and actively harming children with little choice in the matter. Covenant Children’s Hospital in Lubbock has called for people to avoid excessive vitamin A use, given the potential side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

I discovered this when I looked through his social media posts online and saw some of the pics and messages he shared.&lt;/p&gt;

Something like that has no place in a house where children live, and I told him as much when I confronted him. I was shocked by his response.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s not good enough. I said that I wanted all of the paraphernalia out of the house. Jason told me I didn’t get to dictate what he and his wife do in private. I told him we’ll see what the court has to say about this.&lt;/p&gt;

I realize that your ex’s proclivities may be shocking to you, but he and his wife aren’t doing anything wrong. They are two people in a committed relationship having an active sex life, much like other parents all over the world. The sex room and social media sharing may not be as common, but as long as they have committed to keeping their exploits away from their children, they aren’t violating any rules. There are many moms and dads who screw each other’s brains out on the family couch when the kids are away; these two have taken steps to create a child-free zone dedicated to lovemaking.&lt;br&gt;Please cease your attack on your ex’s way of life; he’s not putting his children in harm’s way. When your daughter comes back to you, talk to her about her time with her dad and his family; if anything ever seems amiss, then raise your concerns. But for now, you honestly shouldn’t have any. This couple’s sex life is none of your business so long as they keep it away from your child, and it sounds like they are. Please don’t bother some overworked CPS employee with something like this when there are children in actual danger that they need to worry about. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;—Jamilah&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;New research from The University of Manchester may reshape our understanding of what happens to the immune system when we fast. The study on mice shows that the brain's hypothalamus controls how the immune system adapts during fasting, through a handful of highly specialized neurons responsible for making animals hungry.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;i&gt;Science Immunology&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciimmunol.adr3226" target="_blank"&gt;the study&lt;/a&gt; shows the brain's perception of hunger or fullness, rather than actual eating or &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/caloric+restriction/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;caloric restriction&lt;/a&gt;, is enough to drive changes in the body's immune cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings cast doubt on the current view that a lack of nutrients alone controls how the immune system responds to fasting, indicating the brain has a critical role, beyond the simple absence of food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By artificially switching on specific brain neurons in mice—which typically signal low energy levels—scientists induced a synthetic sense of hunger. Remarkably, within hours, they saw a fast reorganization of immune cells in the blood, with a noticeable drop in &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/inflammatory+monocytes/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;inflammatory monocytes&lt;/a&gt;. These artificially hungry mice looked, from an immune perspective, just like mice that had fasted for real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery could have important implications for developing new therapies to treat a range of inflammatory diseases as well as for treating wasting syndromes seen in cancer, in which individuals lose weight despite eating normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may also explain why obesity often accompanies inflammatory conditions and why malnourished individuals are more prone to infections and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The lead senior researcher, Dr. Giuseppe D'Agostino, who coordinated the study, said, "Our perceptions can shape our bodies in ways we don't always notice. It's easy to see how thoughts guide our actions, but this study reminds us that even our internal body adjustments that are not under conscious control respond to the brain's signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This study underlines how important the brain is in regulating the immune system. But if internal or external factors alter the brain's perception, these processes can go awry, reminding us how deeply the mind and body are—and should remain—connected."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaborator and Manchester immunologist Professor Matt Hepworth added, "This work challenges the long-standing view that fasting's immunological impact is driven purely by nutrient levels. It highlights the nervous system's profound influence on how the immune system adapts during fasting."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lead author Dr. Cavalcanti de Albuquerque said, "By showing how the brain exerts top-down control over &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+cells/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt;, we can further explore when and how fasting might deliver health benefits. It also opens up potential ways to treat infectious, inflammatory, metabolic, and psychiatric conditions."&lt;/p&gt;

But actually finding pockets of time to sweat all throughout the week can be tricky, especially if you have a demanding day job and/or a hectic personal and family life. But, get this: Only exercising on the weekends or a couple of days a week may be as healthy as spreading physical activity out throughout the week, depending on your activity level, new research found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study was not perfect, it has raised plenty of questions about how much you really need to care about your exercise frequency and regularity. Here’s what researchers found—plus why doctors still recommend spreading out your workouts, if and when you can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/christopher-j-berg" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Christopher Berg;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Christopher Berg&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is a cardiologist at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at the Orange Coast Medical Center. &lt;a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/provider/bert-mandelbaum-819188.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Bert Mandelbaum;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Bert Mandelbaum&lt;/a&gt;, MD, is a sports medicine specialist and orthopedic surgeon and co-director of the Regenerative Orthobiologic Center at Cedars-Sinai Orthopaedics. &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/rwjms.rutgers.edu/people/jason-womack__;!!Ivohdkk!iMisgUKIoV09PW_VwMgQagrzAONwMouVZU3wC5WOGhcp4vB6LYLIi9bzTxBTeeXbClOvIZiJ1CV29Gp2BnPD7SRwy9McPQ$" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jason P.

The researchers organized participants into three groups based on their activity level:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol class="caas-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active weekend warriors: &lt;/strong&gt;People who get enough moderate-to-vigorous physical activity to meet health guidelines (150+ minutes per week), but at least 50 percent of their activity happens on just one or two days per week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Active regulars&lt;/strong&gt;: People who also hit the moderate-to-vigorous exercise criteria, but who spread it out more evenly across at least three days each week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inactive&lt;/strong&gt;: People who didn’t meet the recommended 150+ minutes of exercise a week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that both the active regular and weekend warrior groups had a lower risk of death from all causes (up to 32 percent), as well as a lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease and cancer. “Engaging in physical activity concentrated within one to two days was related with a similar reduction in mortality risk as more evenly spread activity,” the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically, you shouldn’t sweat it if all you can manage is to crank out your workouts on weekends—it's still better for your health than being less active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Generally, if you're looking at people who are exercising at all, there is going to be some health benefit compared to people who are not working out as much," says Jason P. Womack, MD, chief of the Division of Sports Medicine and associate professor in the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can weekend warriors earn the same health perks as more consistent exercisers, you ask?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At baseline, the study results suggest that getting in the recommended weekly amount of exercise is beneficial for your health—especially when you’re looking at risk for conditions like heart disease and cancer risk, says Bert Mandelbaum, MD, sports medicine specialist and orthopedic surgeon and co-director of the Regenerative Orthobiologic Center at Cedars-Sinai Orthopaedics in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This [research] really shows that some exercise is good, more exercise is better, and most exercise is best,” he says. Being able to get your heart rate up for a certain period of time will always be helpful for your overall health, no matter when you can squeeze it in, Dr. Mandelbaum notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christopher Berg, MD, a cardiologist at MemorialCare Heart and Vascular Institute at Orange Coast Medical Center in Fountain Valley, CA, agrees. “Exercise is medicine, and its impact on overall health—particularly heart health—cannot be overstated,” he says. That's true whether you spread it out or jam it in over a few days, he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, what should women take away from this finding?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can only work out on the weekends, you can continue to do just that without stressing that you’re somehow screwing up your health. But the doctors we spoke with still aren’t convinced that &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; being a weekend warrior is the move if you do have the choice to spread out more exercise out during the week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons for this. One is that the researchers in this study only looked at seven days of physical activity data to determine what kind of exercise routine people had in place. So, someone who looked to be a so-called weekend warrior on that particular week may have actually been a more regular exerciser on other weeks—possibly skewing the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need a strength program that fits into a busy schedule?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://membership.womenshealthmag.com/womens-health-premium-membership-single.html?cds_tracking_code=whl_edit_inline_weekend_warrior_study_a64388450" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Sign up for WH+;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Sign up for WH+&lt;/a&gt; for exclusive follow-along programs that work for every lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another is that there are certain health metrics, such as &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a30796655/what-is-vo2-max/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:VO2 max;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;VO2 max&lt;/a&gt;, that the study didn’t look at. (VO2 max measures how much oxygen you can use during intense exercise, and it’s considered a good indicator of fitness.) For example, “you can impact your VO2 max favorably by pushing workouts to the weekend, but you’ll have an even better VO2 max if you work out more consistently,” Dr. Mandelbaum explains. The study also didn't look at factors such as organ health or longevity, Dr. Mandelbaum points out—it only looked at mortality rates from specific causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One more thing to consider: Being a weekend warrior can also raise your risk of injury, especially if you’re starting from a lower level of fitness, Dr. Berg says. (If you only exercise once or twice a week, your body may not get accustomed to regular movement and muscle engagement, which can set you up for injury or not allow for &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g30626595/active-recovery/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:proper recovery;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;proper recovery&lt;/a&gt; between intense sessions.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But ultimately, if working out on the weekends, or only a couple days in general during the week, is all you can manage, then great. But Dr. Mandelbaum recommends trying to do what you can to incorporate more pockets of movement into your schedule where you can. “Wake up a little earlier, and be more creative about when you can exercise,” he says. “The best bet for your health and fitness is to put exercise in some form into your day, every day.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 17:57:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiekFVX3lxTE1uUlVOcmZUTC1SSm4xU0hORkZLT3BybmRBeE1WQlBDUUtsWG9LOG1TTHZSOWd2MmxDd0R1SWJaYWtGMUN2RVc2VG9KV1JQV2w1NnEzbDJNdVBXVkh5UmpBZ1hFc0l3azFGZnBObHg3SDVLOGVFN2E0a2x3</guid></item><item><title>Dementia: Shingles vaccine lowers risk by 20%, large dataset suggests - Medical News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxOcmhtYWNfY0M0UEsydnY4QWF3OFVBSVQ4MTh4U2M1a1dmWk5pUEdpM1ZYNXNFeGc2WUk3U2lBZHprRmJKRmhueTFyTVQwcXd6MUV4VS1sTkw1ODRRY3dfTlptOVJ4QkpDaXJxMG8tU004b1RESFhyaXhmUnl5S3N2cnpJSW41b0loQmF0emRxSU5RQVNlcHBkeUtn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-12va8w7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;figure class="css-yhe8zq"&gt;&lt;span class="css-rwmw5v"&gt;&lt;span class="css-mjp0j9"&gt;&lt;picture class="css-16pk1is"&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/04/dementia-shingles-Stocksy_txpbe0d1e3aBi6400_Medium_674423-Header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 1190px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/04/dementia-shingles-Stocksy_txpbe0d1e3aBi6400_Medium_674423-Header-1024x575.jpg 750w" media="(min-width: 990px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;source srcset="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/04/dementia-shingles-Stocksy_txpbe0d1e3aBi6400_Medium_674423-Header-1024x575.jpg 879w" media="(min-width: 768px)"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;img src="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/04/dementia-shingles-Stocksy_txpbe0d1e3aBi6400_Medium_674423-Header-1024x575.jpg" alt="several syringes" class="css-1jytyml"&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;hl-share-overlay class="css-1mqo1cs"&gt;&lt;a class="icon-hl-pinterest css-anm8j2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" data-event="Any Page|Image Pinterest Click|Icon Clicked" data-element-event="OPEN|CONTENTBLOCK|Any Page|Article Body|BUTTON|Image Widget Pinterest Click|" href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.medicalnewstoday.com%2Farticles%2Fshingles-vaccine-could-prevent-1-in-5-dementia-cases&amp;amp;media=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia.post.rvohealth.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F04%2Fdementia-shingles-Stocksy_txpbe0d1e3aBi6400_Medium_674423-Header-1024x575.jpg&amp;amp;description=Dementia%3A%20Shingles%20vaccine%20lowers%20risk%20by%2020%25%2C%20large%20dataset%20suggests" title="Share on Pinterest" data-pin-custom="true" data-share-url="https://media.post.rvohealth.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/04/dementia-shingles-Stocksy_txpbe0d1e3aBi6400_Medium_674423-Header-1024x575.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="css-z1zfa"&gt;Share on Pinterest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-share-overlay&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;figcaption class="css-1pu01zb"&gt;Getting vaccinated against shingles could help keep dementia at bay.

About half of those eligible for the vaccine received it, compared with almost none of those not eligible. In their analysis, they allowed for the fact that not everyone who was eligible for the vaccine received it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 7 year follow up, of the 296,324 people in the sample, 14,465 had at least one diagnosis of shingles. Those who had received the vaccine had a 37.2% lower relative risk of getting shingles than those were unvaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, the researchers did not differentiate between different types of dementia. A person was recorded as having dementia if there was a new diagnosis of dementia in the electronic health record data, or if dementia was listed on their death certificate as a primary or contributory cause of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 35,307 people were newly diagnosed with dementia during the 7-year follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Of these, people who had received the shingles vaccine were 3.5% less likely to receive a dementia diagnosis, which corresponds to a relative reduction of 20%.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://recognitionhealth.com/team-member/dr-steven-allder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-yw7z3z"&gt;Steven Allder&lt;/a&gt;, MD, consultant neurologist at Re:Cognition Health, not involved in this research, told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The findings strengthen the case for encouraging shingles vaccination in older adults. If further research confirms the link between the vaccine and lower dementia risk, it could make vaccination an even more compelling public health strategy. Given the high economic and social costs of dementia care, a relatively inexpensive vaccine could prove to be a cost-effective preventive measure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effect of the vaccination on dementia risk differed markedly between the sexes, with a much greater reduction in new diagnoses of dementia in women than men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This was seen despite the vaccination having similar effects on diagnoses of shingles and &lt;hl-trusted-source source="PubMed Central" rationale="Highly respected database from the National Institutes of Health"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493198/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-yw7z3z"&gt;postherpetic neuralgia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; — chronic nerve pain that can last up to several months after shingles — in both men and women.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could be due to biological differences in immune response between men and women,” Allder suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Women generally have stronger immune reactions to vaccines, which might lead to a greater protective effect. Additionally, shingles is more common in women, so reducing its occurrence in this group might have a more pronounced impact on dementia rates,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, &lt;hl-trusted-source source="Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)" rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/shingles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-yw7z3z"&gt;the CDC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt; recommend the shingles vaccination, &lt;a href="https://www.shingrix.com/about/discover-shingles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-yw7z3z"&gt;Shingrix&lt;/a&gt;, for those aged 50 or over, and for anyone over the age of 19 with a weakened immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/what-are-medicare-and-medicaid" class="content-link css-yw7z3z"&gt;Medicare&lt;/a&gt; or insurance may cover all or part of it. Generally in the U.S., the vaccine costs around $400 for the 2-dose course. According to the CDC, the vaccine is not associated with any severe adverse events, and is over 90% effective in preventing shingles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United Kingdom, the shingles vaccine is provided free by the National Health Service (NHS) to people between the ages of 60 and 80 and those who are &lt;hl-trusted-source source="National Cancer Institute " rationale="Governmental authority"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/immunocompromised" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-yw7z3z"&gt;immunocompromised&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/hl-trusted-source&gt;. Each dose of the 2-dose course &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/south/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/12/Adult-Vaccination-Programmes-Toolkit-SW-2024-25-v4.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-yw7z3z"&gt;costs the NHS £160&lt;/a&gt;. It is also available privately, costing around £460 for two doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers who conducted the current study suggest that if further research verifies their findings, the shingles vaccine could be a much more cost-effective way to prevent or delay the condition than existing pharmaceutical interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, some key questions remain in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The current study assessed dementia risk in people who had received the older vaccine, which used a live-attenuated form of the virus. Shingrix is a recombinant zoster vaccine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.providence.org/doctors/family-medicine/ca/santa-monica/david-cutler-1255368338" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-yw7z3z"&gt;David Cutler&lt;/a&gt;, MD, board-certified family medicine physician at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, CA, not involved in the research, urged some caution about the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutler asked: “If the effect on dementia was real, was it due to the vaccine or was it due to the lower incidence of shingles in the study population?“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Clearly the Zostavax vaccine was effective at preventing shingles. However,“ he cautioned, “that vaccine is no longer available in the United States. Instead, we have the much more effective Shingrix vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Until a study is done comparing the Zostavax and Shingrix vaccines, involving thousands of people over many years (very costly, and unlikely to occur) it won’t be known if the Shingrix vaccine will yield comparable effects,” he told &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While this study provides strong evidence of a link between shingles vaccination and lower dementia risk, a randomized controlled trial would be needed to establish a definitive causal relationship. If confirmed, this could shift public health priorities and encourage further research into how vaccines might play a role in preventing neurodegenerative diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cutler agreed. “For now, a good take home point is that shingles vaccines are effective for preventing shingles, which is adequate reason for getting this vaccine if you are eligible. An additional, benefit might be protection against dementia,” he told us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he added that: “This protection is far from assured. So […] the other known means of preventing cognitive decline as we age should still be pursued.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 16:48:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOcmhtYWNfY0M0UEsydnY4QWF3OFVBSVQ4MTh4U2M1a1dmWk5pUEdpM1ZYNXNFeGc2WUk3U2lBZHprRmJKRmhueTFyTVQwcXd6MUV4VS1sTkw1ODRRY3dfTlptOVJ4QkpDaXJxMG8tU004b1RESFhyaXhmUnl5S3N2cnpJSW41b0loQmF0emRxSU5RQVNlcHBkeUtn</guid></item><item><title>Tackle these 17 health factors to lower your risk for dementia, stroke and depression, study says - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxPRE41TTQ4ZXJKcENUai1JblFfVlVNOVlJXy0tTUFWV2c3YS04aGV5Y2NSeVVlNi1xeEtVdlU2Z0xQTWM0UzdtUmx1Nk1MdmtwVVRibU9LWEZPeVdwZEhjbFd2a0VaQ2J3YnRtUzNIamRpY1l3Ump6Y1V1a0dQYmc2OGRCSFhGb3d5TXp6cUYwSDQ2RDhuaWJKWmxTNFctaWlQM3fSAZgBQVVfeXFMTXVBck5SaUhVNXRYQjBSM3psX1Njd2VScVVlTm95SUFHeGtfYmhUSk9YcFNkeGpUSmtiVjF6bGQ5ZGlqNkpaUDI4bW9wNkplOVJTeXNYVjhKR0VPVlBnZGhYdF9PTEpPX1N2RE1pYXE1aTJXaUVjTEpjWkwyVXdRd244bWxWTzg5X2lucFhTMUZiTkVkQzBZMXI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

Deaths from strokes &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(23)00277-6/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;may double by&lt;/a&gt; the same year, and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3830423/" target="_blank"&gt;10% to 20%&lt;/a&gt; of adults experience depression later in life.

            While the numbers are striking, there’s a growing body of evidence showing that many of these cases may not be genetically fated, but rather could be delayed or prevented altogether by addressing health factors generally within our control.

            “This study just really shows how powerful lifestyle and behavioral changes are for age-related brain diseases,” said senior study author Dr. Sanjula Singh, an instructor in neurology at Harvard Medical School and principal investigator at the Brain Care Labs at Massachusetts General Hospital.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm92xebrs000o3b6mz914dqbq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Ultimately, we hope that people feel like there’s a hopeful message in here — that there are actually so many things that you can work on, and then not only your risk of stroke is lower, but also of dementia and/or of late-life depression,” Singh noted.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm92xebrs000p3b6m4xhdoult@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the past, studies, tools or risk-prediction models have usually focused on these conditions individually. “From a human perspective, that doesn’t make a lot of sense,” Singh said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm92xebrs000q3b6met2l2woe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ideally, people wouldn’t want to develop any of these conditions, she added, so the research team wanted to find shared risk factors so people can essentially achieve multiple goals using the same tools.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm92xebrs000r3b6mou2ct88l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The authors reviewed 59 meta-analyses — syntheses of data from multiple similar studies — that were published between 2000 and 2023 and had investigated the effects of modifiable risk factors on stroke, dementia and/or late-life depression among adults who weren’t previously diagnosed with these conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm92xebrs000s3b6mnlhmz6on@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            All 17 factors were shared by at least two of the conditions, but there were no meta-analyses on relationships between late-life depression and 11 of the health measures: alcohol intake, BMI, blood sugar, cognitive activity, diet, hearing loss, kidney function, pain, physical activity, social engagement and stress, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm92xebrs000t3b6mi28sls8z@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Of all the measures, blood pressure had the biggest impact. A &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/blood-pressure/art-20050982" target="_blank"&gt;normal blood pressure level&lt;/a&gt; is below 120 over 80 millimeters of mercury, or mm Hg. People with a level of 140/90 mm Hg or greater were more than twice as likely to have a stroke, 20% more likely to develop dementia and 16% more likely to experience depression.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm92xebrs000u3b6m3lymuctc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other top influential factors were smoking, sleep, physical activity and blood sugar.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm92xebrs000v3b6mc1o4xqeh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Grouping these all together is important, because I think different people derive different levels of motivation to make a behavior change” based on their personal concerns, such as a family history of dementia, stroke or depression, said Dr. Richard Isaacson, preventive neurologist and director of research at the Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Florida. Isaacson wasn’t involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm92xebrs000w3b6mlsil6ix5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Data studies like this can help empower people to make meaningful changes in their day-to-day lives,” Isaacson added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            If 17 items seem overwhelming, look at it as a menu from which you can choose a few items — and work your way through the list over time, Singh said. But also know these factors overlap, she said — if you’re improving your diet and exercise, for example, you’re probably improving several things on that list, including blood pressure, blood sugar, sleep and cholesterol.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm92xebrs000y3b6mlsf4ojz6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Not sure what to choose? Here’s how you can address what experts said are some of the most important determinants of dementia, stroke and depression.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm92xebrs000z3b6mfxwjw1vp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Lowering high blood pressure:&lt;/strong&gt; High blood pressure means less blood flow to the brain, which has a direct relationship with stroke and dementia, but is also associated with depression by way of reducing neurotransmitters in the brain, Isaacson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm92xebrs00103b6my2iadupm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To address high blood pressure, you can have your level checked by a machine at a drugstore, a doctor or a home device, experts said. &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/sodium/how-much-sodium-should-i-eat-per-day" target="_blank"&gt;Lowering salt intake&lt;/a&gt; and getting &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/changes-you-can-make-to-manage-high-blood-pressure/how-potassium-can-help-control-high-blood-pressure#:~:text=Understanding%20the%20benefits%20of%20potassium,Certain%20medications" target="_blank"&gt;enough potassium&lt;/a&gt; are important for reducing blood pressure, as well as exercising, losing excess weight, managing stress and seeing a sleep specialist if you &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/28/health/biden-sleep-apnea-cpap-machine-wellness/index.html"&gt;have sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;. A doctor can determine whether you also need medication.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Get enough sleep: &lt;/strong&gt;Older adults need &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/how-many-hours-of-sleep-are-enough/faq-20057898" target="_blank"&gt;at least seven hours&lt;/a&gt; of sleep nightly. You can help ensure a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/26/health/sleep-hygiene-tips-wellness/index.html"&gt;good night’s rest&lt;/a&gt; by keeping your room cool, quiet and dark; not drinking alcohol or caffeine in the several hours before bed; limiting screen time at night; and having a bedtime routine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Regulate your blood sugar:&lt;/strong&gt; Exercise, weight management and a healthy diet that limits refined carbohydrates and added sugars can also &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/14/health/diabetes-prevention-wellness/index.html"&gt;maintain healthy blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; levels.

            The findings from the latest study inform the existing Brain Care Score, which was &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/05/health/brain-care-score-dementia-stroke-risk-wellness/index.html"&gt;developed in 2023&lt;/a&gt; at the McCance Center for Brain Health at Massachusetts General Hospital to help people gauge and manage their risk for dementia or stroke without medical procedures.

            The 21-point score refers to how a person fares on 12 health-related factors concerning physical, lifestyle and social-emotional components of health. To this list, the new study adds pain, depressive symptoms, hearing loss, cognitive activity and kidney disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

Now, researchers at Weill Cornell Medicine believe it could help cancer cells grow and multiply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the lab, researchers deliberately gave mice breast cancer cells and fed one group of them safflower oil, which is high in linoleic acid. The mice fed the oil had faster-growing tumors than the placebo group that did not consume linoleic acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Their research revealed linoleic acid can activate mTORC1 — the 'control center' in cells that decides whether they grow, divide or make proteins. In aggressive breast cancer, excess linoleic acid overstimulates mTORC1, fueling tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr John Blenis, the study’s senior author and a cancer researcher at Weill Cornell Medicine, said: ‘We now know that linoleic acid feeds cancer cell growth in a very specific way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘This discovery helps clarify the relationship between dietary fats and cancer, and sheds light on how to define which patients might benefit the most from specific nutritional recommendations in a personalized manner.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Doctors recommend taking in more omega-3s in the form of salmon and other oily fish and nuts. Omega-6s, though, generally come in the form of vegetable oils used in cooking, processed foods, and fast food&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Excess linoleic acid is delivered throughout the body by a protein called FABP5, which overstimulates the mTORC1 in cells, promoting tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers measured levels of FABP5 across various kinds of cancer before deciding to test the acid’s impact on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, which produce much higher levels of FABP5 than other types of cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Before inserting the cancer cells into the mice, researchers conducted experiments in lab petri dishes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They grew human breast cancer cells, both TNBC and hormone-positive, and added pure linoleic acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once the acid was introduced, the mTORC1 'control center' was activated only in the triple-negative breast cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Further experiments showed linoleic acid only overactivated mTORC1 when FABP5 was present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then for the mice experiment, one group was fed a high-linoleic acid diet, while the other group ate their normal diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One group had triple-negative breast cancer cells that naturally produced too much FABP5, while the other group had non-TNBC tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They found that linoleic acid fueled the growth of tumors only in mice with cancers that had higher levels of FABP5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The research team tested their findings in mice with triple-negative breast cancer. When fed a high-linoleic-acid diet, these mice showed more tumor growth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study marks the first time a precise biological mechanism has been shown to connect linoleic acid from food to cancer growth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Nikos Koundouros, the study’s first author, said: ‘There may be a broader role for FABP5-mTORC1 signaling in other cancer types and even in common chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research has long debated whether omega-6 fats, such as linoleic acid, contribute to cancer, but conflicting findings left the question unresolved.

For stages two and three, 60 percent of patients live past five years of diagnosis, the Cleveland Clinic reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, once stage four is reached, the chances of surviving after five years plummet to just 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

On Monday, the Trump Administration directed federal agencies to pause the disbursement of $11.4 billion in loans and grants, according to &lt;i&gt;The Hill&lt;/i&gt;. In Texas, where the recent outbreak has hit hardest, 50 vaccination clinics have been closed as a result, and more than 20 public health workers have been laid off. The Texas Department of State Health Services has identified 422 cases since late January; 42 patients have been hospitalized and one school-aged child has died. Nationally, three separate outbreaks have affected 483 people in 2025. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), run by vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr., oversees health initiatives. He suggested Thursday that some of the agency’s fired employees would be asked to return. “Some programs that were cut, they’re being reinstated,” Kennedy told reporters. “Personnel that should not have been cut were cut. We’re reinstating them.” It comes after he announced plans last month to slash up to 10,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a class="read-it-at-btn" href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5230563-texas-measles-vaccine-clinics-trump-funding-freeze/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;Read it at &lt;span&gt;The Hill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Daily Beast</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 15:12:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxQZXNCbmh5N1VBVk03WUVHUV9heV9HMmFOc3Rkbjd4RFNsSzFmUGZaRWY2LWlRTFNKSWFreHBQbnlCd21QcEo5dDdTM1pFSUdsdkNuQnh3U3gxc1pJUFdqTUx3MENubjd1cTRlU3lNZTNHTFJ3Z21rMzJyTzNtZHVwTi1MNW1fUkVsN19rc0FuX3A</guid></item><item><title>The Secret to Longevity: Keep Moving - Chasing Life with Dr. Sanjay Gupta - Podcast on CNN Audio - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxNY0FPeVVDMDQ1WmxQbGg5Nl9lWEpMQmZhc0I3blFUWXUxSE41SkFFc0JjdnBCS2FHVThqLTItemN6V09fcUdsWE5VUGxfbzd6VThweWZzdjMxb0dfZV9haXdSZDIwNmM1dTRhQ0UtN3U4TmY0NlFSV0lVU01fZFJMbHJRTE9xeFpmanZNMjgxcFdUeDVhR2kyZQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="episode-transcript-container" id="transcript-container"&gt;

              'Welcome to Chasing Life! I know for me, between having three teenagers, having dogs, the carpools... finding time to exercise is not always easy, but at the same time, it is essential. It's got to be as important to you as the most important habits in your life. You've got to make exercise and movement one of those priorities. And that is why I am recording this podcast right now from the ground. Okay, I'm going to explain. I know you can't see me, so you're going to have to take my word for it, and my wife, who is actually helping me right now, I'm sitting down on the ground, crisscross applesauce, a man in his mid-fifties, why? Because it turns out that doing this every day, just sitting on the ground is really good for my body, it's really good for my joints, and good for muscles, but also importantly, my ability or inability to get up from this position without really using my hands or any help from Rebecca. That is a real test of my overall health and fitness.
            &lt;/p&gt;

              Because it's not about strength. It's about your ability to move your body to solve problems that we know are going to become important to you.

He's a physical therapist, a former professional athlete, co-author of a really good book called Built to Move, The Ten Essential Habits to Help You Move Freely and Live Fully, and he wrote that book with his wife Juliette.

              'Ultimately, we want to give you more movement choices. So what we see is that people who sit on the ground, their 5K times get faster. Their backs stop hurting. They want to walk more. They want interact with their neighbors more because their bodies feel better. And it's simply because we're having the body engage in body-like things.

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'So I wanted to have Kelly on the podcast today to talk about this idea of mobility. What exactly is it? Why is it so important as we age? What are some potential red flags? And to give all of us busy people some of the simple tools to improve our range of motion, our posture, decrease our pain, and yes, become more mobile. I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, and this is Chasing Life. Criss-cross applesauce to standing up. I'm not gonna lie, I did use for a split second my left palm to sort of just boost me up.

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              You know, I think when I was reading about you, one of the things that sort of struck me was this idea of just fitness and how people define it. Like I think of myself as a fit person, but to be honest, after again, reading some of your work, I started to wonder about that a little bit because I focus a lot on strength, I focus on cardio. But one of things that you talk a lot about though is mobility. And it almost seemed like a third pillar. So cardio, strength, mobility, and it made total sense as I was, you know, again, reading your work. So I wonder maybe if we could start with some basic definitions. What is mobility? What does that mean?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

              'We, when we started to think critically about how teaching this and the language around it, what we had was non-specific words like stretching and flexibility.

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Right and what you'd say to someone is do you stretch and like your coaches were like, did you stretch? Oh, yeah. Yeah sure coach I stretched and like

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Yeah, yeah, sure. So what we found was we didn't have clear definitions of what those things meant. So we tried to use this word mobility and what we intended were, and I would say, I'll give you two definitions. One is that every physician on the planet, every physical therapist, every chiropractic physician, all agrees about what the body should be able to do. We've said, here's what blood pressure is, and everyone knows that, and here's what temperature is and everyone knows that. We started to become very sophisticated about understanding some aspects of our physiology, but not range of motion. So what ended up happening is we create this definition of do you have access to your native range of motion? Can you control it? And when we improve those things, did what matters to you improve? Now let me give you the definition that I have in my 50s, right? This is a little bit different now. Number one, are you pain-free? And I think this is really important because I think the problem is that it's very normal for human beings to experience pain and discomfort. That is, I mean, talk to your children, everyone like knee hurts, back hurts, right? This is a feature and what we're trying to do is help people reimagine what does pain mean by starting by saying pain is a request for change. And number two, I want you to be able to do with your body what you want as it relates to your job, as it related to your recreation, as it relate to being a family member. And that's a much better definition of mobility.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So just a couple of quick questions about that. The normative range of motion. So again, I think cardio and strength and I can measure how fast I'm running. I can see how much weight I lift. But when it comes to mobility, I'm in my 50s as well. So would your normative range of motion and mine be the same? Is it changed throughout our lives? Different from men and women?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Kelly Starrett
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:05:49
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'Great question. So no, the one thing that doesn't have to change over the whole lifespan is your range of motion. We absolutely are likely to see if you know, nobody ever said, hey, you should put your arms over your head or be able to take a big breath, you might get stiff in your shoulders and upper back. What we don't have change is our access to our range of emotion. So for example, one of the ways that one of ways we want to think about this is I have a finite amount of time to work on my body. It would be great if I could go to a fantasy health ranch and I could have someone massage me every day and someone makes my meals and someone does a perfect program. But let me introduce you to having teenagers and working a crazy job. And like this is all of us. And so one of the things we really try to spend a lot of time is saying, how do we simplify the process so it doesn't feel so overwhelming? I'm not giving a busy working mother another listicle. Here's how you're gonna optimize your morning routine. She's just stoked to have a coffee and get her kids out the door with lunch, right? So what we wanna be thinking about is where are the places in my day-to-day life where I have some agency and some control? And one of the things I'd like everyone to leave here with is if you begin to sit on the floor in the evening for 20 or 30 minutes. We know you're watching TV, the research bears that out. So all I want you to do is... get off your couch and sit on the floor. And you can sit cross-legged, you can be 90-90, you can side-saddle, you put your legs out in front of you, you can kneel, I don't, it doesn't matter. In fact, when you need to fidget, go fidget change your positions. But what we found is that if we can spend 20 or 30 minutes in the evening, touching some of these novel shapes of the tissues. You know, we're in, if we took a step back and I said, okay, I'm gonna look at all of your movements during the day. What are all the things that Sanjay does during the day? I could create almost like a library of words, of vocabulary words. I can see the shapes you are in. Most of us occupy just a few shapes. We just use a few words. We get up out of the bed, we stand up, we walk around, we sit back at the desk. Maybe I do a little peloton, which again is more sitting and it just, you know, more aggressive sitting. And all of a sudden what we see is we didn't really take our bodies into the shapes and positions that we're capable of. And one of the ways that we can begin to shift and expand your movement language is to just start to have some exposure to some of these shapes where having the body engage in body-like things. And I think that's how we can began to say, how do we simplify this seemingly complexity in that world? Well, let's begin by sitting on the ground.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I love that. I mean, it's simple, obviously, but and I think I understand what you're saying. You're utilizing different you say language, but using different muscles different Joints and things like that to sit on the ground and then you have to get up and that's by the way a quick side story. Jimmy Carter, I interviewed him several years ago as 2015 I think yeah, what a guy And I'll never forget at the end of the interview he was sitting in a nice chair and at the end of the interview, he got up out of that chair without putting his hands on the side rests. And I was just kind of blown away by that. Of course, you know, a lot of people when they get up out of a chair like I am right now, they're kind of giving themselves a little boost with their arms. He didn't do that. And I remember thinking, I hope I'm like that when I'm in my 80s. But you've brought up this notion a couple of times now, Kelly, this correlation between mobility and longevity. Yeah. Well, my guess is, you can correct me if I'm wrong, is that as a society, especially in the developed world, we've probably become less mobile because we're addicted to these devices, we're sitting in these chairs, on computers. So it's gotten worse, not better, and yet at the same time, we know that mobility is associated with longevity.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

                00:09:53
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              We can absolutely just start there is that we can say, well, what's the number one reason people end up in the ER? Turns out it's falls. What's the Number one predictor of death above people at 65? A fall. And one of the reasons we're seeing is if I don't have access to balance or range of motion, I can't solve as many movement problems and losing your balance is a movement problem. Getting up and down and being independent is a movement problem. Being able to rise from a chair while you're holding your baby or your cat or holding a cup of coffee and a book is just a movement problems. So how can we keep as many movement solutions available to the brain as we can and the stiffer we become, the less access easily that we have of our joints, but getting up and off the ground, not only Does it help me create and maintain my movement solutions. It correlates really well with living well because of all the ancillary benefits that come with it. I'm more likely to garden and be outside and be able to stay connected to my community. I'm likely to want to be in an exercise class. I'm more likely to be less timorous about riding my bike around Central Park. And the real question is, who and where are we thinking about this? And the answer is, we're not. We like the word. We think longevity is definitely a buzzword right now. We all want to be, we're obsessed with being old. But ultimately, Julia and I feel like, my wife, and who's my business partner, we feel like durability is the best word. And the reason is, we think the hits are going to come. If you're over 50, you're going to, something bad, Your body's going to throw an error. You're likely to have something bad happen to you. You are not as robust. So, what we're really saying is If I wanna have a joint and tendons that act like joints and tendions my whole life, I better use that joint and I better load those tendons. Otherwise, they're not gonna be available to me as readily. And the good news everyone, muscles and tissues are like obedient dogs. They always adapt. At no age do you stop healing. At no wage do you lose the ability to reclaim range of emotions. It's gonna be a little slower than when you were 15. That's true. but the bottom line is your body is always going to adapt. So let's begin with something really simple.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

              'Look, I think as much as we talk about fitness on this podcast, I don't think we've talked about this topic enough, and I think Kelly is really spot on here. The human body has this remarkable ability to adapt and grow and heal, in both directions, by the way. It can get bad really fast, and it can improve really fast. So it's never too late to reclaim our ability to move pain-free and to live well. So when we come back, Kelly's going to give us some pretty simple tools to help us get started.

And one of the things that you talked about in the book was this concept of mobility vital signs. Yeah. And you're likening this to, you're measuring your blood pressure, your respiratory rate, actual vital signs, how did that come about? How did you start to think about this in terms of vital signs?
            &lt;/p&gt;

              We do and and that exists though to be clear like if I  if I came to see you Kelly, The idea that you could objectively tell me what my what my What these measures should be for my mobility that exists that exists

              'Absolutely. And you don't need a professional person to help you understand how your body moves. So for example, everyone can understand that 120 over 80 is not heroic blood pressure. It's a sign where we start to say, hey, maybe we need to make a little small change in our environments, our behaviors. And what we found was that we hadn't done that for how the body moves in space. And we certainly hadn't in the language of mere mortals. So how can I understand my range of motion. How can my children begin to understand their minimum range of motion? And then what are the simple tools to help me just keep an eye on it? We were democratizing self-care. The same way we all think we all should probably eat fruits and vegetables and some quality protein, we should get some sunshine and we should play. We just wanna objectively measure those things a little bit so that we can begin to say, oh, wow, I haven't done this for a while. Or, hey, my knee hurts. I look at how stiff my quads are and it turns out I found a problem and that's something I can change.
            &lt;/p&gt;

              Everyone should read the book. It's one of those things that probably should just be there right as a manual for your life next to, you know, the joy of cooking, a finance book, whatever it might be. But you mentioned the first vital sign, which is being able to get up and down from the ground, which I think is great. Second one, I'll just mention a few of these. Maybe we can talk about a couple of them. Breathing, just how long can you hold your breath? Um, which again, there's objective measures of this. You can count how long you can hold your breath, but there's normative standards as well.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'The first movement of the spine is the breath. That's the first thing that the body does is it takes this breath. Rib cage needs to expand, the belly distends, right? And what we see oftentimes is we fail to appreciate how the environment is impacting my ability to ventilate effortlessly. So probably people have heard that when you're not working really hard, you should probably be able to breathe through your nose most of the time. And one of the reasons we do that is that we get better function. Suddenly if I take a nose breath, my diaphragm is recruited. If I breathe through my mouth, I don't really use my diaphragms. I end up using my neck musculature. But if I'm using my knack all the time to ventilate because I can't access my diaphragm or I'm sitting in a chair, well suddenly you have really ineffective breathing So you're going to walk up those stairs and feel out of breath, even though You're not. And then the impacts it potentially has on our anxiety, our abilities to regulate, is really profound. And what's cool is that I'm pretty sure modern people are not the first people to ever think about breathing. I'm sure it's a cornerstone of the yoga traditions. People have been doing this for a long time, but by tapping into the objective work of our brothers and sisters out there, we were realizing that, hey, we should probably put this as a vital sign because it has so many possibilities to up-regulate function. Right, right. No.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              There's 10 of these vital signs, and I'm just gonna tick through a few of them. The next one is one that I gotta tell you, Kelly, I have trouble with hip mobilization. And it's interesting, I remember, I like to do triathlons, and I remember getting done with a triathlon and just being kind of pretty racked at the end of this thing. Way more racked than I should have been. I was just like, God, I mean, this is not fun, and I feel. And I went to go see a physical therapist who was near the finish line, and right away it was all about my hips and the hip mobilization. So you've listed that sort of as a third vital sign. Why is it so important and what could someone like me do about it?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

                00:17:35
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Well, you know, we fortunately have already talked a little bit about one of my favorite interventions which is sitting on the ground. Which is your first vital sign as well, right? So these are, these, they're related. Yeah, absolutely. So looking at how your knee comes to your chest is one of those key pieces. And one of the reasons we started with the sit and rise test is that in order to stand up from a seated position, cross leg position, you have to lean forward to shift your center of mass over your feet. So you're sitting cross legged, but if your hips are stiff and you can't bring your knee to your chest or your chest to your knee, that becomes impossible. It becomes an impossible test. So all we're doing is putting the body into position that requires more normative, not even full range, just some baseline range of motion to express that hip range of motion. And the reason we love that test is that it's one of the first times where people confront the fact that their hips are stiff, because you were able to do a triathlon and still kick butt, but you didn't even need to have full range of motion. But what you experienced is that you paid a very high session cost. You had to pay a price for this inefficiency. So imagine you're driving your car with your handbrake on. Look, cars, human beings aren't cars, I get it. But if I just click that handbrake on one notch, there's sort of a drag on the system. You're not gonna get good fuel economy, your brakes get a little hot sometimes. It's not a high performance machine. So all we're trying to do is say, let's take the brakes off by restoring. And this knee to chest is a really simple way to do that.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

              'I'm going to do it right after this podcast. I'm going to self-assess, Kelly, and I'll call you and let you know how it goes. Another chapter in the book is called Future Proof Your Neck and Your Shoulders. And again, we talked about the fact that so many of us are on devices and staring at computer screens way too much. What's an easy way for listeners to sort of assess if they're starting to get into the danger zone with regard to that?
            &lt;/p&gt;

                00:19:38
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Well, let's start by saying not necessarily a danger zone. You could have terrible shoulder range of motion, not be able to take a full breath, and you may never have neck pain. But likely is your tolerances for silliness start to go a little bit down, right? And then you've been in front of your computer all day long, and all of a sudden you're like, hey, your neck is a little but sore. And again, I think most of us are like, my neck's a little sore, let me reach for that glass of wine or ibuprofen because I don't have time for that right now. So what we can do instead is start to say, hey, what is it I'm supposed to do? And notice that we already talked about one of the most important interventions for neck pain, which is breathing. So if we restore your ability to ventilate, to take a massive breath, what you're gonna see is that your rib cage, your thoracic spine, ends up being a really important chassis off of which your neck and head function. So we start to see the neck, the shoulder, and the upper back as a really simple system. And if we want to improve one aspect of the system, we look at other aspects of that system. So for example, if you're sitting here with me and you're listening to this and I'm slouching, if I turn my head to the right, I may not be able to rotate as far. Now watch this. Get into a position where you can take a big breath. So you and I are both going to adopt slightly dwarf organizations. I didn't tell you what to do with your head or your shoulders. As I said, get into a positioning and take a bigger breath. And if you rotate now from that position, you'll see that you can rotate a lot further. And that hints at the fact that when we're in better sort of organized sort of geometries, better structures, that hint at more function, we get more function back. And when we restore people's function, we oftentimes knock paint out because we're not overusing tissues, we're misusing tissues.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

              So say we all.

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              So say we all, how big a deal is that? How much do you think about that?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I think we should, if I took a picture of you, just not aware, would you like what you saw, right? In terms of how you're organized. And what I'll tell you is that there are a lot of hints out there about what good organization looks like. Look at the Vitruvian man, right, shoulders, I mean, that's Shavasana, right. So it's almost like our, you know, our genius was like, hmm, these yogis know something about Shavasna. That's the same organizations as the Vitruvian man. So, really... posture is the Latin derivative is just position. So what you're saying is, I have good position or a bad position. And what we wanna be clear is that there are postures, there are positions and shapes that are more highly correlated with dysfunction. So forward head on neck, rounded shoulders, those positions may or may not ever cause pain, but they're certainly really bad positions to swim in. And more importantly, they are well correlated with disease with dysfunction. But what we don't wanna say is, I have pain because of my posture. What we say is hey, the reason we choose this organization of the body is that it maintains more lights on in the room.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Sanjay Gupta
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:23:04
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              You know, I mean, have you ever wondered why, if we have this sort of native way that we should carry ourselves, this native way, that we should be mobile, that we should sit, if we are sitting or standing, why do we lapse into these sort of bad habits, would you say? What, why does, I mean, because it is quite normal to, if I look around the office, to see a lot of people slouching, or even if they're walking and standing, they're sort of head forward, You know, is it just because of the technologies that? Is that what's doing it to us? Why do we evolve this way?
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:23:39
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              'I tell you what, we, uh, we wrote another book called ready to run. Ready to run, play off on our friend, Chris McDougall's book. And one of the things that we wanted to say is like running is a natural normative skill. But what we noticed with our kids was that we had all these beautiful runners, everyone runs the same in kindergarten. They all like they're little Usain bolts. They run on their foot, they lean forward. They have powerful hip extension. and they land on the ball of the foot, and then halfway through the first grade, some of those kids start to do heel striking. They fundamentally alter their primary locomotive pattern. So instead of sprinting now they're putting their foot out in front of them and heel striking, and they're in these crazy shoes. And it's crazy. That's like halfway through the first great we switched from riding right-handed to left-handed. That's what the equivalent is. Like, hey, we have this skill we've been developing for six years, and now let's throw that skill away and change it. We have to ask, what has changed for this child? And the only answer is they're now engaged in more chronic sitting at desk behaviors. So their bodies have started to adapt. So when we see people our age, the peak of their powers and they're working hard, what we see is their body tells a story of their movement history, of their environments. And there's a reason that when you run into a gymnast, you're like, oh yeah, you are a gymnasts, I can tell, right? You were a dancer. What is it about that? Well, part of that experience of being able to do those things is that we had to practice a certain carriage and organization that turns out to transfer really well to these pieces. And so what we need to do as modern humans now is say, hey, maybe I have to think differently a little bit, or I have sort of manage this adaptation response to the environment. And that might just be by sitting on the ground or. hanging from a pull-up bar, which is one of my absolute favorite interventions. You wanna change your posture, start to put a pull up bar on your house, start to hang on something, go to the park, spend three minutes hanging, you can have your feet on the ground and you will be a different human being into you.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;

              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:25:50
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Even with your feet on the ground, just hanging from the... What is it? Just, it's, I guess, addressing many of the things that you're talking about with these vital signs. Yes, yes.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              and doing so in a play, movement position. Right, you can do downward dog too. Three minutes of downward dog a day will get you. But what you'll see is that I don't even have to be skilled. I can just put my arms up and just let gravity take over and you'll start to see changes in your shoulder, changes in you upper back, your ability to rotate, your ability take a big breath. All of those things will change. And maybe some of you need four minutes a day and some of only need one minute a day. This is, this is,
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              This far more fascinating than I even expected it to be. And I expected it be fascinating. I love this. Will you come back, because what I'm going to do is I'm gonna spend some real time putting into practice some of the things that you've talked about today. And I'd love to give you a report and just get some feedback.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I love it. And I, again, I want to get beyond pain, no pain. I want to be, I wanna know how you swam faster, how you dusted that kid, that young 17 year old kid at the gym, I wanted to know how you crushed him. And ultimately, you know, we feel like if we can improve the health of the household, we don't need to worry necessarily about some of the things that the universe is telling us to worry about. We are robust, incredible humans and the magic is being able to spend time with our friends and family, with our neighbors, and walking, playing, these are the ways of how we transform our communities and society.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;

              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              I mean, that's the ultimate measure, I think, like you said, but the human body is so remarkable. And I sometimes think, you know, people buy these really fancy SUVs that are all tricked out and all they do is drive their kids to school a couple miles and back. They never really put it to the test. And some of the things that you're talking about allows our human bodies to be put to the test and to show off a little bit in terms of what we can do, which is fantastic.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;div class="transcript-clip-container"&gt;
            &lt;div class="speaker-info"&gt;
              &lt;p class="speaker-name"&gt;
                Dr. Kelly Starrett
              &lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p class="clip-time"&gt;
                00:27:51
              &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p class="clip-script"&gt;
              Yeah, you know, I'll just leave everyone with an anecdotal story. We started walking school bus for our to bring our kids to elementary school. Not everyone felt like they could walk their kids were like, we'll be here. It takes about 25 minutes, we will be here every morning. We have a little more flexibility in our schedule. But drop your kids off. And so we started dropping, we started walking our kids and we got out of the drop off lane, which was toxic and chaos. And we'd walk this mile and a quarter to school, interact rain or shine. And then parents were kind of started jumping in with us. And We had a couple parents who lost 30 pounds. Wow. Walking their kid to school. And they were like, this has changed my life. I'm like, hold up, we just walked your child to school, we walked two miles a day and you lost 30 pounds? Like, that's not fair. And so I think when we start to put movement and we start think differently about the choices we make, suddenly those small aspects end up aggregating to really massive change. We just need to run this experiment for our lifetime.
            &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

Of these, about 30,000 die from the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;C. difficile can lurk in hospitals for months because outside of the body the bacteria forms spores that are very hard to get rid of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And in the UK, data from the country's public health service suggests about 16,000 people are now infected every year — with cases rising in hospitals. About 2,100 die from the infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacteria is hard to clear from facilities because it can form invisible spores outside the human body that survive for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In mild cases, infected patients may suffer frequent bouts of diarrhea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But in more severe instances, the disease may cause diarrhea 10 to 15 times a day alongside persistent abdominal pain, a swollen abdomen, fever and rapid heart rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors warn it can be mistaken for food poisoning, a stomach flu or a normal side effect of medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To treat the infection, doctors may stop administering antibiotics to a patient — leaving time for the patient's immune system and microbiome to target the bacteria and kill it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Or they may administer a strong antibiotic — such as Vancomycin or Metronidazole — to kill off the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, published in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.2787?utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_term=040425"&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/a&gt;, scientists took samples from 200 patients who were admitted to two intensive care units over several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thousands of samples were taken, both from patients' skin and from hospital surfaces and the hands of healthcare workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These were then analyzed for the presence of C. diff, with the bacteria's DNA then decoded to allow researchers to track individual strains throughout the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Overall, they detected the bacteria in about 10 percent of the patients sampled — with C. diff either on a patient's body or in the room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn't clear how often the bacteria was detected among healthcare workers. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed in most cases the bacteria was genetically identical to that of another patient or that found in another room, suggesting the C. diff bacteria from one patient was unknowingly transferred to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team also found that in &lt;span&gt;more than half of the potential transmission events, the two patients involved were not even in the hospital at the same time — sometimes separated by weeks — demonstrating how persistent the bacteria is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Rubin added: 'What I'm hoping we get from this paper is that healthcare providers put a greater emphasis on infection prevention measures and adhere to them as much as they possibly can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Those are the measures that can help interrupt this type of invisible transmission.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To kill the bacteria's spores, the Environmental Protection Agency says to use bleach at a 1:10 dilution with water to disinfect surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers added that not all C. diff bacteria cause disease and that in most cases they observed harmless varieties of the bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nonetheless, they said that the spread of these non-disease-causing bacteria still revealed routes that the more dangerous version could take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 15:03:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxObXhuYTJZeHdBLUVEZGVIZ0Z5WDVNa1dkbWhjbF9IRmltaVpLYThoZllkaWhmbXBSbUY4bWwxY2F3dm9zWjd3T1YyQkJSSXp6ZFJKUkx3cnV4b2RYb0x3Uk9RSHdaelhiU0x3aWdCMWZETmczZHNYYmFnWWxvcTFhSWlpS1phODR1RXFYcl9UeWtNek1xSFBjQ3dWRkpJd9IBowFBVV95cUxObG12X3pEMC1lTUMzYzhHMF9RdkZETVJPMmM1ekpEWGNvNEQ0aExkS3FiN2ZkaHFLbmRKV3VLTHlZSF9qc1IyRThfT3MycG1MSDZxbTVpYzF4cTN1a243VkpqWkhVRHg1LVpwNGZOblpmbXZ2S1d5MU13VnNlazZOOWpRMWVwaFpuRVNPTklwRVNwSnBvQmNvNFpOWjFCa1pOZlJZ</guid></item><item><title>Hormone-Free Male Birth Control Pill Enters Clinical Trials For The First Time - ScienceAlert</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxOYjZxVnlCNFV1YVhqTlJjSXBVREZVa20wNFJXRXBteHpnSTUwMG5LTFZ5NTR6OEh4STRoMzBGQTI2alRiU0hpUEJJMC1ZZjllSTBnRUZMNWo5dUhsZGFWMmlic1dLNFkxbzBnT3hsVlluYm1tZVJhVHdnV0RmSm53eWdqdkQzMC0yalB0YU14WWlxeEpMOUJyLTdjTkJzN2w0azFIMGhwUzJUU00?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A hormone-free male birth control pill is undergoing clinical testing for the first time ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug, called YCT-529, has performed incredibly well at limiting the production of sperm in mice and non-human primates, all while producing very few side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-attempt-at-a-side-effect-free-male-contraceptive-has-proven-effective-in-mice"&gt;In male mice&lt;/a&gt;, the unique contraceptive kicks in within a month of use, reducing pregnancies in female mates by close to 100 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Male macaques require a higher dosage of YCT-529, but it also causes a rapid plummet in sperm count without severe side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the animals soon regain their fertility when the medicine is stopped. The drug also causes no significant changes in three hormones important for sperm production: testosterone, FSH, or inhibin B.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to female hormonal birth control, male birth control that influences sex hormones can produce unwanted side effects, such as weight gain,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/depression" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73097" data-postid="156928" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;depression&lt;/a&gt;, or increased levels of 'bad' cholesterol. In the past, these unforeseen consequences have &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/11/the-different-stakes-of-male-and-female-birth-control/506120/"&gt;stopped some effective forms&lt;/a&gt; from continuing in human trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has led scientists to try &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/on-demand-male-contraceptive-pill-could-switch-your-sperm-off-for-a-day"&gt;non-hormonal methods&lt;/a&gt; instead, and so far, they are proving &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/mens-health/male-birth-control-gel-results-promising-rcna153349"&gt;hopeful&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A phase 1  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="156928" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; for YCT-529 is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.contraception.2024.110809"&gt;already over and done&lt;/a&gt;, and while we don't yet know the results, they were successful enough that the drug is now entering phase 2, which assesses safety and efficacy. The trial began in &lt;a href="https://www.nzcr.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/YCT-529-02-NZCR-PISCF-Phase-1b-v5.0_22Nov24_Clean.pdf"&gt;New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; in September 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"A safe and effective male pill will provide more options to couples for birth control," &lt;a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/first-hormone-free-male-birth-control-pill-clears-another-milestone"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; medicinal chemist Gunda Georg from the University of Minnesota. "It will allow a more equitable sharing of responsibility for family planning and provide reproductive autonomy for men."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Georg's lab &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.contraception.2024.110809"&gt;began investigating&lt;/a&gt; YCT-529 years ago because of its impact on a protein called retinoic acid receptor (RAR) alpha. This receptor interacts with retinoic acid – a metabolite of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="156928" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; A – to influence cell growth, sperm formation, and embryo development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_156933" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-156933" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/dcp1107_380.png" alt="Sperm Production" class="size-full wp-image-156933" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-156933" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Sperm production produced via retinoic acid (RA). (&lt;a href="https://wi.mit.edu/news/retinoic-acid-regulates-transitions-mouse-sperm-production"&gt;MIT&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;YCT-529 blocks RAR-alpha, and because it only targets this one version of the receptor, it limits possible side effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ongoing research has since received funding from the National Institutes of Health and brings together scientists from Columbia University, the University of Minnesota, and the pharmaceutical company YourChoice Therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago, Georg and her colleagues said they would have &lt;span&gt;clinical trials&lt;/span&gt; running by 2022. The research is running slower than predicted, but it's still heading in a positive direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief science officer and founder of YourChoice Therapeutics, Nadja Mannowetz, &lt;a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/first-hormone-free-male-birth-control-pill-clears-another-milestone"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; their animal studies have "laid the groundwork for human  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="156928" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; of YCT-529, which are progressing efficiently."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"With the unintentional pregnancy rate at nearly 50 percent in the US and globally, we need more contraceptive options, particularly for men," she &lt;a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/news-events/first-hormone-free-male-birth-control-pill-clears-another-milestone"&gt;adds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YCT-529 isn't the only non-hormonal male birth control under exploration. A 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-type-of-reversible-male-contraception-proves-a-success-in-mouse-study"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, led by scientists at Baylor College of Medicine, tested another compound, called CDD-2807, which stops male mice from siring litters when it is injected. It is not yet undergoing clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last time a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/expert-explains-why-male-birth-control-options-are-so-limited"&gt;male contraceptive&lt;/a&gt; was approved for sale was in the 1980s when scientists figured out how to do a minimally invasive vasectomy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.contraceptionjournal.org/article/S0010-7824(23)00063-X/abstract"&gt;A 2023 study&lt;/a&gt; surveying more than 2,000 male respondents found more than three-quarters were willing to use new contraceptives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Women have shouldered the burden of pregnancy prevention for too long," Mannowetz &lt;a href="https://www.clinicaltrialsarena.com/news/yourchoice-birth-control-pill/?cf-view"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in a recent press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Data continue to show that men want to help, and they're willing to try new birth control options. Data also show women trust them to do so. After nearly two centuries of no innovation in male birth control, it's time for change, and we're pleased to be a part of it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43856-025-00752-7"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

James Kinross, a GI surgeon who researches how the gut microbiome affects our risk of the disease, believes "an internal climate crisis" among people in Western countries could be partly to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But "the gift of the &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gut-health-boost-overall-digestion-better-moods-2024-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; is that you can change it," said Kinross, referring to the trillions of microbes that populate our digestive system, and which research suggests have a wide-ranging affect on our health. "It is an ecosystem that you can adapt," the researcher at Imperial College London told Business Insider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To lower his own risk of &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-risks-young-people-reduce-diet-alcohol-2024-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;developing colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;, the second deadliest form of cancer disease in the US, Kinross follows dietary principles including eating a vegetarian diet. However, as BI has previously reported, a person's diet is just one piece of the puzzle when it comes to &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-environmental-causes-microplastics-antibiotics-sleep-2025-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;colon cancer risk&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental factors such as &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/scientist-studies-ultra-processed-foods-rules-to-stop-overeating-simple-2025-4" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, the use of antibiotics, which kill gut bacteria, &lt;a target="_blank" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/human-blood-microplastics" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;microplastics&lt;/a&gt;, and limited exposure to nature, are thought to have made our gut microbiomes less diverse, he said. That means it's less healthy and resilient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He gave the example of a child who is born by C-section, which means missing out on microbes that would have been passed on via the birth canal, to a mom whose gut microbiome is depleted by&lt;s&gt; &lt;/s&gt;antibiotics, and fed a diet of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-ultra-processed-foods-impact-your-body-calories-weight-gain-2025-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt;, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're seeing a generational loss in our internal ecology, which is being hammered with a series of environmental hits that it simply cannot adapt to," Kinross said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consequence is "a very unhappy microbiome," which produces harmful molecules and toxins that affect colon cancer risk, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kinross shared how he eats to lower his risk of colon cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

In February, it &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/02/11/g-s1-47661/trump-musk-usaid-ukraine-south-africa-mexico-colombia-india-afghanistan-hiv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;gutted&lt;/a&gt; the U.S. Agency for International Development, which plays a crucial role in supplying other countries with HIV treatments. On March 21, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services &lt;a href="https://insidehealthpolicy.com/share/147528" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;terminated the Adolescent Trials Network&lt;/a&gt;, or ATN, which is the only national research network focused on adolescents and young adults who live with, or are at risk for, HIV. The National Institutes of Health &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/31/trump-administration-hiv-research-grant-cuts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;terminated grants&lt;/a&gt; related to PrEP, medications that can prevent HIV infection. And this week, the administration laid off &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/01/cdc-rif-2400-layoffs-rfk-jr-hhs-reorganization-rapid-response-capability-weakened/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;scores of workers&lt;/a&gt; at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who focused on HIV prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since its formation in 2001, ATN has enrolled more than 30,000 people in over 150 studies, many of which focus on the ongoing HIV epidemic, and expanded access to PrEP. But it has a more expansive remit, also studying the rising incidence of STIs, and mental health and substance abuse disorders in young people. Nevertheless, the network's termination letter used the same language seen in letters from the National Institutes of Health that intend to eradicate "diversity, equity, and inclusion" in scientific research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The infectious disease epidemiologist Tara Kerin had started working on &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06738407" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;an ATN study&lt;/a&gt; focused on the antibiotic doxycycline, which has a growing reputation as a "morning-after" pill for STIs. Last year, the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/rr/rr7302a1.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;recommended &lt;/a&gt;this STI-prevention strategy—called doxycycline postexposure prophylaxis, or doxyPEP—for cis men and transgender women, citing evidence that it has been shown to reduce syphilis and chlamydia infections by 70 percent and gonorrhea by about 50 percent. Although evidence suggests that doxyPEP would be effective in other populations, such as cis women or transgender men, the CDC did not yet have enough clinical data to recommend the drug to these other populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ATN study Kerin was attached to aimed to solve that problem—testing if the antibiotic also prevented STIs in adolescent and young cis women. "Women in general are usually left out a lot of studies," Kerin said. "So having this specifically looking at how we can prevent STIs in women would have been really great." But the study was canceled on March 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kerin was not a full-time federal employee. But this ATN grant, which was already funded and approved, would have covered most of her salary for the next four years. In fact, ATN projects "have been mostly paying my bills since 2017," she said. Now, the grant's cancellation means Kerin will be out of work in a few months. In the U.S., &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00924-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;thousands of scientists&lt;/a&gt; like Kerin depend on grant money from the federal government to pay their salaries. As federal funding for their research is cut, these scientists risk losing their jobs, their labs, and their careers. I spoke with Kerin about how this study would have given a generation of women more control over their health, her fears of a medication-resistant strain of HIV, and why the health of Americans is inextricable from the health of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I would love if you could tell me about how you decided to become an infectious disease epidemiologist.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I actually wanted to be a lawyer. And then I took a couple of classes and decided, no, I don't. I don't want to talk about politics all day! Which is hysterically why I thought, oh, I'll go into science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ended up changing my major. I got a degree in neuroscience and ended up going to Penn State, where I got a degree in bio-behavioral health. I was doing a lot of lab work—you know, the pipetting behind the bench. A couple years later, I ended up getting a job at the CDC. I was working in the rotavirus lab. Rotavirus is basically the stomach flu for kids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., [rotavirus] is no big deal. It's a pain. I actually think I remember when me and my siblings got it—we were just all basically stuck in the bathroom. But in developing countries, it was a leading cause of childhood death. You get dehydrated, just because they don't have the same resources that we would have. So it was a worldwide problem, even if day-to-day in the U.S. we weren't bothered by it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that time, they also developed a vaccine, which was awesome. I was so excited about this. One thing that is obviously, extremely important is you're never going to get rid of a disease unless you get rid of it worldwide. I think COVID and the Ebola outbreaks that we had more recently have shown that with all of our abilities to travel very quickly, that also means that these diseases travel a lot quicker than they used to. At this point, if there is a disease anywhere, it can be in your backyard within a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that time when [that] great vaccine was on the market, and—I mean, we're thrilled! Over the moon! You've been working on this virus, and all of a sudden it looks like, in essence you've got a preventative care for it. But as I was driving to work, there would be protest lines. They were people who were anti-vax. This is right around the time when Jenny McCarthy is getting her platform on Oprah. To me, it was just sort of this mind-blowing, like, what? You guys think these are unsafe? What's going on? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first ATN study I was on was looking at recently [HIV] infected young adults. HIV is this wildly—I mean, it's kind of cool—wildly smart virus. First it attacks your immune system. It just goes right for the jugular: You can't fight us, because I'm directly going to fight what you fight us with. But now we have these &lt;a href="https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/hiv-treatment-basics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;antiretrovirals&lt;/a&gt;, right? So you take these pills, and it keeps your detectable level of virus gone. We now know that if you do not have a detectable level of virus—so if you take your pills pretty much every day—you take a blood test and there's no virus. You can't spread it. So you can have sex. You can have babies. You can do all of that stuff that we thought that people with HIV would never be able to do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been reports of some children being able to go off the medication, and the virus doesn't appear to come back. The reason why the virus comes back is because it hides. A section of it will hide away in this little reservoir—HIV reservoirs, we call it—so the medication can't get to it there. It just stays there. And it just waits and waits and waits. It'll kind of pop its head out and be like, "All clear?" and then it will, boom. So children who have had HIV, their immune systems are a little bit more pliable. Those reservoirs might be smaller. The idea is, all right, so what if we catch people right when they get sick, these young adults that still have these moldable immune systems, and see if we can shrink these reservoirs so at some point they can go off medication? Because the meds aren't great. I mean, it's like, just take a pill. But they're not just a pill. They have side effects. They have issues. It is a pill, or a set of pills, that you would have to take every day for the rest of your life. So you know, you're looking at the way to eliminate that entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now this new one that I'm doing, or &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; doing for the ATN, was on doxyPEP. HIV also has what they call PrEP and PEP. Prep is a pre-sex drug—so pre-exposure prophylactic that you can take so that you are less likely to get HIV. This is great. It's sort of like [a] birth control type of thing. If you can take that, and people who, you know, "Oh, I'm thinking about having sex tonight, I'll take this," then they can be a lot more safe. There's also PEP, and that's the post-exposure. That's something you take within 72 hours, that can also help you, kind of like your plan B pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They have found in men, when they've looked, that it can actually prevent a whole bunch of STDs or STIs—oh, really cool. There's this post- thing you can take in 72 hours, and then you don't have to worry about chlamydia or gonorrhea or syphilis or any of that stuff. They've also done some things that have shown if you take doxyPEP before sex, much like PrEP, and again, in men, this is shown that it might be effective as a prep as well as a PEP. But this new trial that we were doing was looking at it in women. Because we don't have any data in women, or not much anyway. So that was what we were working on. And it came from the Adolescent Trial Network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a really cool network. It managed to bring sites all over the U.S. If you had an idea for a project and you could get funding, you could also do it within all of these sites. One of the hardest things to do in any study is recruit people. It's a pain. I've tried to be in studies, and I'm like, oh god, this is so hard! This is not worth it! So I understand. And this sort of thing also gets you across the country, so you'll have a population that is more representative. Los Angeles does not necessarily represent the rest of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were millions of dollars in these projects. There are a lot of ATN projects going on over time. There's been a couple hundred since the ATN was formed back in 2008—while ago, somewhere in those early aughts. So that was just completely shut down. It wasn't just the ATN that was shut down, I also work on some other HIV projects to pay my bills. All of those were shut down as well too. They're targeting HIV, which is frustrating on levels not just for me, but for science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The grant that was just canceled—you mentioned it was going to cover the next four years of your work. How long had that been covering your work before?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It  basically just got started. We had been working on the first part of the study, [which] is getting it ready. We'd been making protocols and manuals and training for staff, and getting an app made. I'm so sad about that app. I feel like that app was a lot of work for a lot of people, and it was really cool. I'm very bummed about that, not ever really getting out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were three arms. One was standard of care, which is just STI education, condoms, talking about things, testing. The other one was doxyPEP on demand, so they could ask for it within 72 hours of having sex, and they would get that. And then the third one was we were assigning that group to take the doxyPEP every week, regardless of their sexual activity. So that one was the pills. I just started working on that, I guess, at the end of last summer. We were ready to launch, and I got, on Friday: Stop work completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could [you] briefly cover the work that you had done for the grant, all that you had accomplished thus far?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a lot of paperwork to do at the beginning. Getting an institutional review board approval. You've already gotten permission from the NIH, but now you also have to go through another level of scrutiny to make sure that this study is ethical. That you have all of your ducks in a row. You have thought about everything that could possibly happen and making sure you have a plan and a backup plan. How are you going to deal with adverse events?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The standard of operating procedures—it doesn't sound like a big deal, but, boy, that takes months to get right. Again, all of those things need to be in print, every possible scenario and what you're going to do, and describing the procedure down to the smallest thing. Because, the idea is, if anybody has a question about what to do, they will have an answer. By the time an NIH study gets out and started, it's already been optimized to be a well-oiled machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you have the standard operating procedure. And then every single thing that you're doing has what we call the manual of operations (MOPs) too. I had just written one on all the sample collection. There's one of how to collect hair—how far down? How long does it need to be? Where you need to put it afterward? How does it need to be stored? We were also doing swabs, both throat and rectal or front hole. We had swabs everywhere. We mostly try to encourage those to be self-collected by the participant. But we also need to be able to tell them how to do it. And also be able to tell the staff if they need to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also another one on counseling—how to counsel people for reproductive health, not just giving scripts, but also how to give the resources to everybody that they need. How to treat the STIs once they're found. Where do they need to go? How quickly? How are we making sure that we are keeping these women safe and healthy? We were a little delayed. We were supposed to have launched already, but it got pushed off until April because we had two issues. One, some of our sites were coming from another collective called the &lt;a href="https://www.hptn.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;HPTN&lt;/a&gt;. That's the HIV trials. It's another HIV collective. And &lt;em&gt;for some reason&lt;/em&gt; they weren't getting the money from the government. So we were like, OK, we're going to have to pause on them. Then we had another issue with the medication supplier, so we had pushed this off just slightly—which I guess, in hindsight, is for the best. Because it'd have been pretty awful to start people on something and then be like—just kidding!—and take it away. They cut us off right before our launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you learn that the grant was cancelled?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was in another meeting, and the [principal investigator] of the study called me, which was odd. I mean, it's not odd, but, you know, a little odd. I was like, alright, well, I'm going to decline because I'm in this meeting. But I also just had a weird spidey sense about it. Then she texted me right after, she was just like, call when you can. And I was like, oh, this is not going to be good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They told me it was canceled. I'm not gonna lie, I knew HIV would be on the chopping block. It deals with populations that a lot of that administration does not like to admit exist. So not a huge surprise. But it was a surprise how quickly it happened. I assumed it might be something where we might not be renewed. But I was not quite prepared for stopping on a Friday in March. I had a good cry, and then I got to take the rest of the day off. And then just started trying to get my ducks in a row. The thing that sucks is everybody is on a hiring freeze right now. And additionally, even pharmaceutical companies that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; hiring have got hundreds of people that are super-qualified going through one [posting]. It's tough. Because I know at the end of the day, I'm probably going to end up taking a job that was for someone who has a master's, and they're going to end up having to take a job for somebody who has a bachelor's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you stop taking medication, the HIV pops out of the little reservoir, and it takes a look and it's like, oh, the pills are gone. Let's get going again. But it's smarter this time, and it becomes resistant to the medication you were taking. This is a problem with people who tend to stop and start their medications a lot. They become resistant to the medications to the point that the medications are a lot less effective. Back in January, when USAID was told to stop giving HIV medications to everybody, my first thought was not just that people are going to die, but: Oh crap, we're going to get a medication-resistant strain of HIV. You're not going to get rid of a disease unless you get rid of it everywhere. So all of that work we've done with HIV to get to the point that as long as you take your medications, you can have a really normal life, that just could be totally blown up, which is also very, very frustrating. It's not something you can take a switch and turn it back around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there any recourse for getting another funder to move in [on the grant]? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will be missing out on that opportunity of having the network. While this grant hopefully will live on somewhere, somehow, it will be different. And we won't have the same reach that we had with the ATN. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When these sort of studies are stopped, particularly with this one, we have prevented a generation of being able to have some sort of control over their health in the sexual landscape. And a lot of people, particularly who support the administration, may be like, oh, well, you know, kids shouldn't be having sex anyway. Well, sure. But just like birth control, it's going to happen. And we want to make sure that there's as much safety that goes on—not just with HIV, but syphilis is really bad. Gonorrhea and chlamydia can get really bad. We already know that HPV can cause cancer. These are STIs that can really mess up your life. Sure, there are treatments for these things now. But a lot of times, it's going to have more of an impact long-term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the grant were to be picked up by another funder, would you be able to return to that work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It depends on how and who picks it up. But the bigger problem is that I won't be around. Unless it happens next week, which, even if you get money, it's not immediate. You apply for a grant in April, and you hope to get the money by the next January. I will be long gone at that point. I will not be in the study, but hopefully somebody else would be able to. I've already joked about all the data that I have, and trying to find a really lucky PhD student to go to: Here, analyze all of this and get it out to the world, since I will not be a part of the project!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was curious if there was anything else about this grant or its cancellation, or your fears and concerns that we haven't had a chance to talk about, that you'd want to touch on&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not just the HIV grants. And it's not just all of the other ones that are being stopped. The dismantling of the NIH—and I won't even get into RFK Jr. and all that bullshit—it puts us back for so many years. Because it's not something that, in the next four years, if we get in a different administration, we can just turn this back on. Again, all of these things have been in in the works for years. Particularly if we're going to keep going back and forth on this and having an administration that wants to give money, that doesn't, that does, that doesn't—it is going to hurt our chances of research in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I guess what I don't really understand is how people can look at this and just be, &lt;em&gt;America first&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;focus on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;America&lt;/em&gt; without realizing how connected we are biologically with the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We used to be the best in the world at this. Without our influence, other places will have the stronger influence. When we lose influence, we lose not just power—we do—we lose ground. We lose the ability to protect ourselves.

State health officials said Tuesday there were 22 new cases of measles since Friday, bringing the total to &lt;a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/sxSwi/?v=7" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="422 across 19 counties" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efeac4e4b06ba13d22244c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/sxSwi/?v=7" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;422 across 19 counties&lt;/a&gt; — most in West Texas. Erath and Brown counties, in the central part of the state, logged their first cases. Forty-two people have been hospitalized since the outbreak began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Mexico announced four new cases Tuesday, bringing the state’s total to 48. New Mexico health officials say the cases are linked to Texas’ outbreak based on genetic testing. Most are in Lea County, where two people have been hospitalized, and two are in Eddy County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How many cases are there in Kansas?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kansas has 24 cases in six counties in the southwest part of the state as of Wednesday. Kiowa and Stevens counties have six cases each, while Grant, Morton, Haskell and Gray counties have five or fewer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state’s first reported case, identified in Stevens County on March 13, is linked to the Texas and New Mexico outbreaks based on genetic testing, a state health department spokesperson said. But health officials have not determined how the person was exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How many cases are there in Oklahoma?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oklahoma logged one new measles case Tuesday — for a total of eight confirmed and two probable cases. The first two probable cases were “associated” with the West Texas and New Mexico outbreaks, the state health department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A state health department spokesperson said measles exposures were confirmed in Tulsa and Rogers counties, but wouldn’t say which counties had cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How many cases are there in Ohio?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ohio reported one new measles case Thursday in west-central Allen County. Last week, there were 10 in Ashtabula County in the northeast corner of the state. The first case was in an unvaccinated adult who had interacted with someone who had traveled internationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In central Ohio, Knox County officials reported two new measles cases in international visitors, for three cases in international visitors total. Those cases are not included in the state’s official count becuase they are not in Ohio residents. A measles outbreak in central Ohio sickened 85 in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Where else is measles showing up in the U.S.?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles cases also have been reported in Alaska, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines an outbreak as three or more related cases.

It can then spread, especially in communities with low vaccination rates. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1,274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Do you need an MMR booster?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid measles is to get the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="measles, mumps and rubella" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efeac4e4b06ba13d22244c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="13"&gt;measles, mumps and rubella&lt;/a&gt; (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak, said Scott Weaver with the Global Virus Network, an international coalition. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults with “presumptive evidence of immunity” generally don’t need measles shots now, the CDC said. Criteria include written documentation of adequate vaccination earlier in life, lab confirmation of past infection or being born before 1957, when most people were likely to be infected naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A doctor can order a lab test called an MMR titer to check your levels of measles antibodies, but health experts don’t always recommend this route and insurance coverage can vary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting another MMR shot is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don’t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective measles vaccine made from “killed” virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said. That also includes people who don’t know which type they got.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What are the symptoms of measles?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="dangerous complications" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67efeac4e4b06ba13d22244c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;dangerous complications&lt;/a&gt; such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How can you treat measles?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why do vaccination rates matter?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In communities with high vaccination rates — above 95% — diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called “herd immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;We Don't Work For Billionaires.

After people get the chicken pox, the virus remains in their nerve cells for life. When people get older or have weakened immune systems, the virus can reactivate and cause shingles, per Dr. Russo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="13" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“The varicella-zoster virus can affect the blood vessels and the central nervous system, which includes the brain,” Dr. Russo says. “When you get reactivation of this virus, it could damage your central nervous system, including your brain, through inflammation.” There’s a chance that inflammation may raise the risk of dementia as a result, he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="14" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;“There’s also some lab &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35754275/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35754275/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="evidence" data-node-id="14.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; that shingles can lead to the formation of beta-amyloid, which are a factor in Alzheimer’s disease,” says &lt;a href="https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/who-we-are/our-people/amesh-adalja-md-fidsa" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://centerforhealthsecurity.org/who-we-are/our-people/amesh-adalja-md-fidsa" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Amesh A.

Fox, singers Neil Diamond and Linda Ronstadt, and rock star Ozzy Osbourne living with the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to mark &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/sites/default/files/2025-03/244229%20-%20WPD25%20guide%20HCP.pdf"&gt;World Parkinson’s Day&lt;/a&gt; on April 11, Jennifer Taylor, helpline service manager at Parkinson’s UK, says: “We know more people than ever are being diagnosed with Parkinson’s – it’s the fastest-growing neurological condition in the world with no cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 IoAJj sc-482ou5-3 dzDedB image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 bZqoQk"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bWFKX dpkjCF"&gt;Michael J. Fox is one of a number of names who has Parkinson’s&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 Rqdgl"&gt; (Getty Images for The Michael J.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But with more than 40 different symptoms, it’s often misunderstood and impacts people in a variety of ways.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 WWPRF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She explains that the condition develops when brain cells that produce dopamine, a neurotransmitter which plays a crucial role in motor control, stop working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Parkinson’s is a complex, progressive and incurable condition,” she says. “We don’t yet know exactly why dopamine-producing cells die, but factors such as genetics, environment and lifestyle may all contribute to someone’s likelihood of developing Parkinson’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition’s many symptoms range from tremor to anxiety, and Taylor points out: “While the more well-known symptoms are related to movement, early signs can be much subtler, and people might notice changes like a loss of sense of smell, trouble sleeping, or increased feelings of depression years before any movement issues are noticed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Dr Bal Athwal, a consultant neurologist at The Wellington Hospital (part of &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.hcahealthcare.co.uk"&gt;HCA Healthcare UK&lt;/a&gt;) adds: “As a progressive condition, Parkinson’s can significantly impact quality of life and may reduce life expectancy, but with treatment, the likelihood of it impacting life expectancy can be reduced.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says that although the majority of people with Parkinson’s are aged over 70, a diagnosis can come at any age. The rate of the disease’s progression varies from person to person, but it can be managed effectively through medication, lifestyle changes, rehabilitation and, in some cases, surgery.  But he stresses: “It’s important that Parkinson’s disease is diagnosed properly, and effective treatment put in place.“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what are the early symptoms of the condition? Here’s what the experts say…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Pain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A wide variety of pain can be an early symptom of Parkinson’s, and Athwal says: “Some patients develop pain, which often goes unexplained for some time before the diagnosis is made.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor explains that such pain may include musculoskeletal pain affecting bones, muscles, ligaments, tendons or nerves; neuropathic pain from nerve damage; dystonic pain causing sustained muscle spasms or cramps; and central pain, when pathways controlling sensation and pain in the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord aren’t working properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.  Anxiety&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anxiety can occur in the early stages of Parkinson’s, and Taylor says: “Feelings of constant worry can lead to social avoidance and sometimes anxiety attacks.”  &lt;a href="/topic/evidence"&gt;Evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggests mindfulness, meditation and exercise can help manage anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Trouble with balance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postural instability, or difficulty balancing, can be a challenging movement symptom associated with Parkinson’s. “It can cause falls and people may lose their confidence as a result, with worries about going out in public,” says Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Athwal adds: “Walking problems can be accompanied by imbalance, and a tendency to fall, but this tends to develop in more advanced disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.  Stiffness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/topic/people"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt; with Parkinson’s often report tightness in their limbs, says Taylor, who explains this stiffness can occur on one or both sides of the body, contributing to a decreased range of motion. “This can lead to problems with aching or pain in the affected muscles and/or joints and other more visible signs, such as your arm not swinging as you walk,” she points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.  Losing your sense of smell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reduced sense of smell is often an early sign of Parkinson’s, and Taylor says you might lose your sense of smell several years, or even decades, before a Parkinson’s diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Trouble sleeping and fatigue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain changes associated with Parkinson’s can cause sleep issues, and some people have problems sleeping long before movement symptoms develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athwal says: “There can be problems with sleep such as insomnia, restless leg syndrome, and REM sleep behaviour disorder – a condition in which an individual seems to act out dreams by making movements or noises.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatigue also affects up to half of people with Parkinson’s, and Taylor says: “You may feel quite energised one day and then too fatigued to do much the next, regardless of how much you rest.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Tremor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athwal says tremor is one of the most common symptoms of Parkinson’s, and is usually seen in upper limbs, usually when at rest, rather than when an arm is being used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor says: “Tremor occurs mostly at rest, and it lessens during sleep or when the body part is actively in use. For example, your hand might tremble while sitting still, but this symptom can disappear when you shake hands with someone.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tremor usually starts asymmetrically and tends to occur in the hands, but can also appear in other parts of the body, including the lower lip, jaw or leg. She adds: “Some people report an internal tremor, an invisible shaking sensation inside the chest, abdomen or limbs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.  Depression&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person with Parkinson’s may experience depression at any time, even before diagnosis. Taylor says: “Depression symptoms may come and go but can also intensify both the movement and cognitive symptoms of Parkinson’s.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9.  Smaller handwriting and slowness of movement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Micrographia – small, cramped handwriting – is often an early symptom of Parkinson’s, say the experts. “Words can become crowded together while the size of your handwriting might get progressively smaller as you continue to write,” explains Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Athwal adds: “There is also slowness of movement – this can be quite subtle at first, but people might complain of their handwriting becoming smaller, or might find it harder to do small fine tasks such as fastening buttons and zips.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 WWPRF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.  Diminished facial expressions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facial masking, also called hypomimia, is an early Parkinson’s symptom that can make it hard for others to interpret your mood. “People might assume you’re depressed or upset and it can be frustrating to constantly be asked what’s wrong when you’re feeling fine,” says Taylor. “Stiff or slow facial muscles make it hard to smile, raise your eyebrows or otherwise express your feelings, an important part of how we communicate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parkinson’s UK helpline: 0808 800 0303&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 14:14:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxPbURJRTlvR1VyWjhCNzNid1RkTVB4b2VxWkhSUU0zc3JOTWpnM1hJUmVqRTN4WHh3S2MxRFFubk55TDR6TjZHZ2hJLW9ja0JTZzRhTDZyR3I3Q1RiOXRfMHVWY2UyLWloNmtPY3BEbmVEeEtycUFNeEhITkFmWGJCUGhEYTg5STItRURuREh2a0FuXy00TDFZUkxQR2Q2dndWSllocXFHLXBWVmJuSmRlSzU5aHFtdw</guid></item><item><title>Marriage linked to higher dementia risk in older adults, 18-year study finds - Medical Xpress</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiAFBVV95cUxPLWFPcFFvdG9WQ21RdHVHb1VUc0huU3JYWjEtd01MNWZBQXFjZGZISHN0TWc5V2hQUnJLUHBlZzVBSlZNSkZXOUkyUDAtaV9sX2VDTjRVNm96MGk3VlZuWmtsbWRGRTZuZG5xTFNIY1hjWmExM2VqT1pYdGZzbmRVaFJ4UmVQX1po?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="article-byline text-low"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Florida State University College of Medicine and University of Montpellier researchers found that older adults who were divorced or never married had a lower risk of developing dementia over an 18-year period compared to their married peers. Findings suggest that being unmarried may not increase vulnerability to cognitive decline, contrary to long-held beliefs in public health and aging research.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Marriage is often linked to better health outcomes and longer life, but evidence connecting marital status to dementia risk remains inconsistent. Some studies have reported higher dementia risk among unmarried individuals, while others found no association or conflicting patterns for divorce and widowhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising numbers of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/older+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt; who are divorced, widowed, or never married have raised concerns about potential vulnerability to dementia in these groups. Prior research has not consistently addressed how marital status relates to specific causes of dementia or how factors such as sex, depression, or &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+predisposition/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic predisposition&lt;/a&gt; may influence these associations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, "Marital status and risk of dementia over 18 years: Surprising findings from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center," &lt;a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70072" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/i&gt;, researchers conducted an 18-year cohort study to understand whether marital status was associated with dementia risk in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 24,000 participants without dementia at baseline were enrolled from over 42 Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers across the United States through the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. Annual clinical evaluations were conducted by trained clinicians using standardized protocols to assess cognitive function and determine diagnoses of dementia or mild cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;To assess long-term risk, researchers followed participants for up to 18.44 years, yielding over 122,000 person-years of data. Marital status at baseline was categorized as married, widowed, divorced, or never married.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dementia risk was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression, with married participants serving as the reference group. The models incorporated demographic characteristics, mental and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/physical+health/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;physical health&lt;/a&gt;, behavioral history, genetic risk factors, and diagnostic as well as enrollment variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to married participants, divorced or never married showed a consistently lower risk of developing dementia over the study period. Dementia diagnoses occurred in 20.1% of the overall sample. Among married participants, 21.9% developed dementia during the study period. Incidence was identical among widowed participants at 21.9% but notably lower for divorced (12.8%) and never-married participants (12.4%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hazard ratios showed a reduced risk for all three unmarried groups. In initial models adjusting only for age and sex, divorced individuals had a 34% lower risk of developing dementia (HR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.59–0.73), never-married individuals had a 40% lower risk (HR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.52–0.71), and widowed individuals had a 27% lower risk (HR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.67–0.79).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These associations remained significant for the divorced and never-married groups after accounting for health, behavioral, genetic, and referral-related factors. The association for widowed participants weakened and was no longer statistically significant in the fully adjusted model.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;When looking at specific dementia subtypes, all unmarried participants also showed reduced risk for Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia. In contrast, no consistent associations were observed for vascular dementia or frontotemporal lobar degeneration in fully adjusted models. Divorced and never-married groups were also less likely to progress from mild cognitive impairment to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk patterns appeared slightly stronger among men, younger individuals, and participants referred to clinics by health professionals. Yet stratified analyses showed minimal variation, suggesting that the associations held across a wide range of demographic and clinical subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers concluded that unmarried individuals, particularly those who were divorced or never married, had a lower risk of developing dementia than those who remained married. These associations persisted even after adjusting for physical and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/mental+health/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;mental health&lt;/a&gt;, lifestyle factors, genetics, and differences in clinical referral and evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia were higher in married participants. Risk of progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia was also higher. No evidence linked marital status to vascular dementia or early-stage &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cognitive+decline/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt;. Patterns were broadly similar across sex, age, education, and genetic risk categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unmarried older adults in this study were less likely to be diagnosed with dementia than their married counterparts. Structured clinical evaluations conducted annually by trained professionals showed significantly lower incidence for divorced and never-married participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After adjusting for demographic, behavioral, health, and genetic factors, the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/reduced+risk/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;reduced risk&lt;/a&gt; remained significant for both groups. The findings contrast with prior studies linking unmarried status to increased &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/dementia+risk/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt; and offer new evidence on how relationship status may relate to cognitive outcomes when diagnosis is measured under standardized conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

While more large-scale research is needed, the initial findings are encouraging, especially since these strategies are safe, affordable, and accessible to most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em " data-ua-type="1"&gt;Here is all we need to know about how this combination works and why it might just be a recipe for living healthier for longer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding biological age vs chronological age&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biological age refers to how well or poorly the body is functioning compared to actual age. Someone may be 70 years old chronologically but have a biological age of 60 due to healthy habits. This difference can be measured using advanced tools like DNA methylation clocks—GrimAge and PhenoAge being two examples used in the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The slower the biological ageing process, the longer one might stay active, healthy, and independent in old age. That’s what makes this study so fascinating—it looks at changes happening at the cellular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Omega-3: Fighting inflammation to slow the clock&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; are known for their heart and brain benefits, but they also play a major role in cellular health. Their anti-inflammatory properties help reduce chronic low-grade inflammation—one of the key drivers of ageing. They also combat oxidative stress, which damages cells and speeds up ageing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, omega-3 supplements alone showed a significant slowing in biological ageing across multiple measures. This suggests that omega-3s are doing much more than just supporting heart health—they’re helping cells stay younger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Using behavioral tests, eye-tracking, and brain recordings, researchers found that these dogs paid less attention to faces—especially the eye region—and showed delays in brain responses to facial cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mutant dogs also failed to distinguish between different types of faces, a key feature of social cognition. These findings not only highlight the role of Shank3 in face-related social behavior but also introduce a novel canine model for autism research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Face Attention:&lt;/strong&gt; Shank3 mutant dogs showed less interest in human and canine faces.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Response Delays:&lt;/strong&gt; Face-specific brain signals (N1) were weakened and delayed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impaired Categorization:&lt;/strong&gt; Mutant dogs struggled to distinguish between face types.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Chinese Academy of Science&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study has revealed that Beagle dogs carrying mutations in the &lt;em&gt;Shank3&lt;/em&gt; gene—a high-risk gene for autism spectrum disorder (ASD)—exhibit face processing abnormalities similar to those observed in human ASD patients.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, published on April 3 in &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, was led by Prof. ZHANG Yongqing from the Institute of Genetics and Developmental Biology (IGDB) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Prof. HAN Shihui from Peking University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108389"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/asd-gene-face-perception-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/asd-gene-face-perception-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/asd-gene-face-perception-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/asd-gene-face-perception-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/asd-gene-face-perception-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/asd-gene-face-perception-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/asd-gene-face-perception-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/asd-gene-face-perception-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows two dogs." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/asd-gene-face-perception-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/asd-gene-face-perception-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/asd-gene-face-perception-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/asd-gene-face-perception-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/asd-gene-face-perception-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/asd-gene-face-perception-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/asd-gene-face-perception-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Wild-type dogs were able to distinguish between facial categories, showing an earlier response to faces of other species and a later response to conspecific faces.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASD is a complex group of neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by social impairments and repetitive behaviors. Human social interactions heavily rely on the ability to accurately process facial information, and abnormalities in this cognitive function are considered a key contributor to the social deficits seen in ASD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although numerous ASD-associated risk genes have been identified, it remains unclear whether specific genetic mutations can directly cause impairments in face processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this question, the research team developed a face-based social preference test to assess face recognition behavior in &lt;em&gt;Shank3 &lt;/em&gt;mutant dogs compared to their wild-type counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that mutant dogs exhibited a reduced preference for facial stimuli and lacked the typical inclination toward conspecific faces—faces of the same species—indicating deficits in face-related social behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further examine visual attention to faces, the researchers employed eye-tracking technology. They confirmed that &lt;em&gt;Shank3 &lt;/em&gt;mutant dogs showed significantly reduced attention to faces, with a notable decrease in gaze directed at the eye region of human faces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also used electrocorticography (ECoG) to record brain activity, revealing that &lt;em&gt;Shank3&lt;/em&gt; mutant dogs exhibited both a diminished amplitude and delayed response in the face-specific N1 brainwave component, which typically occurs around 100 milliseconds after presentation of facial stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another experiment, the researchers explored the dogs’ ability to categorize different types of faces—such as by species and breed—using the repetition suppression paradigm, a widely accepted method in human studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wild-type dogs were able to distinguish between facial categories, showing an earlier response to faces of other species and a later response to conspecific faces. In contrast, Shank3 mutant dogs displayed deficits in face categorization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study provides direct experimental evidence that mutations in &lt;em&gt;Shank3&lt;/em&gt; lead to ASD-like deficits in face processing, which may contribute to social impairments. Additionally, it establishes a novel experimental model for future research into the genetic and neural mechanisms underlying ASD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this ASD and genetics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#354c444f5d545b527552505b50415c56461b54561b565b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ZHANG Yongqing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ac.cn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chinese Academy of Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;ZHANG Yongqing – Chinese Academy of Science&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adu3793" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Autism-like atypical face processing in Shank3 mutant dogs&lt;/a&gt;” by ZHANG Yongqing et al. &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Autism-like atypical face processing in Shank3 mutant dogs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atypical face processing is a neurocognitive basis of social deficits in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and a candidate cognitive marker for the disease. Although hundreds of risk genes have been identified in ASD, it remains unclear whether mutations in a specific gene may cause ASD-like atypical face processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs have acquired exquisite face processing abilities during domestication and may serve as an effective animal model for studying genetic associations of ASD-like atypical face processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we showed that dogs with &lt;em&gt;Shank3&lt;/em&gt; mutations exhibited behavioral and attentional avoidance of faces, contrasting with wild-type controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, neural responses specific to faces (versus objects) recorded from the electrodes over the temporal cortex were significantly decreased and delayed in &lt;em&gt;Shank3&lt;/em&gt; mutants compared to wild-type controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortical responses in the frontal/parietal region underlying categorization of faces by species/breeds were reduced in &lt;em&gt;Shank3&lt;/em&gt; mutants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our findings of atypical face processing in dogs with &lt;em&gt;Shank3&lt;/em&gt; mutations provide a useful animal model for studying ASD mechanisms and treatments.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 13:29:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE9KZUhrbzRDQnp0ZkhYM1FLckxoWlgxSF9IZzRTX0ljMkpibDk4eUxZQWdNZmlpNk4xNG1nV1hUSlVKV01TVTU0WDJTNFRJSXB5UEt2TmlyQTBEbC1HVTc0MFVBVTdDeDBwUjFGWjNCVnRXRkpK</guid></item><item><title>Best vitamins and minerals to boost your eye health this spring - Times of India</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spring season can be a treat to your eyes with the lush green surroundings and nature in its full bloom. However, it's also the time when seasonal allergies are at peak, which may affect your eye wellness. Blurry, red and tired eyes are common around this time due to the high amount of dust and pollen in the air. Wearing sunglasses and a hat, washing your hands and eyes regularly, and using an air purifier at home can address many of these issues. It is also important to pay attention to your diet and incorporate essential nutrients to boost your eye health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a list of vitamins and supplements that can take care of your vision during this season:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin A&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitamin A can help elevate your eye wellness by several notches with its ability to improve dry eye symptoms.

The important nutrient also improves the smoothness of the tear film, the thin layer of fluid on the eye. You can include carrots, squash, apricots and watermelon in your diet to improve intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Vitamin C&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another important nutrient for eye health which is abundantly found in citrus fruits, it protects against oxidative stress and can aid in maintaining a functioning tear film. The nutrient helps maintain the function of the tear film and without sufficient amounts of it, the eye may become dry. It also helps strengthen blood vessels and supports collagen production in the eye. Vitamin C is also known to reduce risk of cataract progression. A 10-year study published in the journal Ophthalmology that involved more than 1,000 pairs of female twins found people who consumed more vitamin C showed a 33% reduction in the risk of cataract progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Flavonoids&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mainly present in plant-based compounds, flavonoids have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which can guard against age-related macular degeneration (AMD), cataracts, and glaucoma, as demonstrated by a study published in Biomedicine &amp;amp; Pharmacotherapy.

Along with other antioxidants, such as Vitamin E and Vitamin C, selenium can help combat oxidative damage in the eyes, suggests a study published in Pharmaceutics. It can also prevent damage to the cells in the retina, and prevent against conditions like cataracts.

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saccharin, the artificial sweetener used in diet foods like yogurts and sugar-free drinks, can kill multidrug-resistant bacteria—including one of the world's most dangerous pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;


										      
																																	&lt;p&gt;"Antibiotic resistance is one of the major threats to modern medicine," said Professor Ronan McCarthy, who led the research at Brunel University of London's Antimicrobial Innovations Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Procedures such as tooth extractions and cancer treatment often rely on antibiotics to prevent or treat infection. But doctors are increasingly facing cases where the drugs no longer work."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/antimicrobial+resistance/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;antimicrobial resistance&lt;/a&gt; (AMR) killed 1.27 million people globally, with resistant infections contributing to nearly 5 million deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drug-resistant bacteria such as Acinetobacter baumannii, which causes life-threatening infections in people with a weakened immune system, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, linked to chronic lung infections and sepsis, are on the World Health Organization's list of top-priority pathogens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In exciting work led by our team, we've identified a novel antimicrobial—saccharin," Prof McCarthy said. "Saccharin breaks the walls of bacterial pathogens, causing them to distort and eventually burst, killing the bacteria. Crucially, this damage lets antibiotics slip inside, overwhelming their resistance systems."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saccharin has been part of the human diet for longer than 100 years. While it has been extensively tested for safety in people, little was known about its effect on bacteria—until now with a &lt;a href="https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.1038/s44321-025-00219-1" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; appearing in &lt;i&gt;EMBO Molecular Medicine&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
																																			&lt;p&gt;The international team found that saccharin both stops &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/bacterial+growth/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;bacterial growth&lt;/a&gt; and disrupts DNA replication and stops the bacteria from forming biofilms—sticky, protective layers that help them survive antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also created a saccharin-loaded hydrogel wound dressing that, in tests, outperformed market-leading silver-based antimicrobial dressings currently used in hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This is very exciting," Prof McCarthy added. "Normally it takes billions of dollars and decades to develop a new antibiotic. But here we have a compound that's already widely used, and it not only kills &lt;a href="https://phys.org/tags/drug-resistant+bacteria/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;drug-resistant bacteria&lt;/a&gt; but also makes existing antibiotics more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Artificial sweeteners are found in many diet and sugar-free foods. We discovered that the same sweeteners you have with your coffee or in a 'sugar-free' drink could make some of the world's most dangerous bacteria easier to treat."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization has warned that the world is heading toward a "post-antibiotic era," where common everyday infections could once again become deadly. Overuse of antibiotics in medicine and agriculture has accelerated resistance, and new antibiotics have been slow to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This has created a dangerous situation," said Prof McCarthy. "We urgently need new drugs to treat resistant infections—and saccharin could represent a new therapeutic approach with exciting promise."&lt;/p&gt;

     &lt;p&gt;Genoa, Nev. — Mono County Public Health confirmed a third death due to hantavirus in the Town of Mammoth Lakes. “Hantavirus is a serious and often fatal illness which people can get through contact with infected deer mouse droppings, urine, or saliva,” according to the release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;County commissioners approved a 29-unit project on 4.45 acres 4-1 between Gardnerville Elementary School and Chichester Estates. Developers presented a letter detailing an agreement with the school district. Mark Gardner was the dissenter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gardner also voted against the 5G cell towers with four commissioners approving a year’s continuance for the site at Minden Station 14 and voting to uphold the planning commission approval of the one at East Fork Station 6 on Stephanie Way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t expect we’ve seen the last of that effort against the tower along Stephanie Way. It will be a couple of weeks before the formal record is ready, should the folks who appealed the approval decide to take the issue to district court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An online survey at &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__795e7sdab.cc.rs6.net_tn.jsp-3Ff-3D001zRqce2kndwiBdA4YX7UW4Jkh39iBpwKxEb3v6wPJmiOxBLLYaQvfP5UmkOKph0D7Eae5-5F6HBbo6OzGUpc-2Duy2Vvf7-5F3vZpbI1JNCTKZ2np3W1jZNeh4BU3hgwM6ZVA0ZRR3nFdHR1X-5F4Yl69y3vIIaOzVCF-5FH7-5F3ZDhNEGQHHHg-3D-26c-3D1SvRQqeNud15-5Ff4UsBEn7l33EWKBSXHGU2lQiOO8ZRm4fUUuCIHTjg-3D-3D-26ch-3Dbf9d5D5jVncvkxLYIUzegEofkJ573P-5FyiJz7RUOIlOMNXyOTEEhUGA-3D-3D&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=euGZstcaTDllvimEN8b7jXrwqOf-v5A_CdpgnVfiiMM&amp;amp;r=7h_yVcxwm6Zr8GwSwGtD9GJqnPM6XUxrdMqsqN_0lAw&amp;amp;m=NvK0qtCSmtV7eHg4i2jjfYAukjITMcUE1PtQQVXslBvoFzY-TbZD7zCCof7qtUVH&amp;amp;s=7oDmN39NsdylSeRBqL3fhPtEn1rYKn4L0lzQDxxoMZg&amp;amp;e=" target="_blank" title="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__795e7sdab.cc.rs6.net_tn.jsp-3Ff-3D001zRqce2kndwiBdA4YX7UW4Jkh39iBpwKxEb3v6wPJmiOxBLLYaQvfP5UmkOKph0D7Eae5-5F6HBbo6OzGUpc-2Duy2Vvf7-5F3vZpbI1JNCTKZ2np3W1jZNeh4BU3hgwM6ZVA0ZRR3nFdHR1X-5F4Yl69y3vIIaOzVCF-5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/XBVZTL9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; regarding Title 20 wraps up today.

Researchers tracked nearly 30,000 adults and found that heart failure was associated with a sharp drop in cognitive function at diagnosis and a faster decline in global cognition and executive function over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes occurred independently of common risk factors like high blood pressure or prior heart attacks. The findings underscore the urgent need for early cognitive assessments and patient-centered communication in heart failure care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid Mental Aging:&lt;/strong&gt; People with heart failure mentally age 10 years in 7.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early Decline:&lt;/strong&gt; Global cognition declines nearly 6 years earlier in those with heart failure.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Care Complexity:&lt;/strong&gt; Cognitive decline may impair patients’ ability to manage complex treatment regimens.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Michigan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are over six million Americans with heart failure who are at greater risk of losing their cognitive abilities earlier in life, a study suggests.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team, led by Michigan Medicine, examined the cognitive abilities of nearly 30,000 adults over time, comparing those who did and did not develop heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found heart failure is associated with a significant decrease in cognition at the time of diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108385"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-failure-aging-cognition-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-failure-aging-cognition-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-failure-aging-cognition-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-failure-aging-cognition-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-failure-aging-cognition-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-failure-aging-cognition-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-failure-aging-cognition-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-failure-aging-cognition-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows two brains." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-failure-aging-cognition-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-failure-aging-cognition-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-failure-aging-cognition-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-failure-aging-cognition-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-failure-aging-cognition-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-failure-aging-cognition-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/heart-failure-aging-cognition-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Decisions about treatment, Shore says, are complex and highly dependent on cognitive capacity. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global cognition and executive functioning also declined more rapidly over the years after heart failure diagnosis, as people with the condition mentally aged the equivalent of 10 years within just seven years of a heart failure diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are published in &lt;em&gt;Circulation: Heart Failure&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Heart failure is a disease that never goes away and treating it relies heavily on a patient’s ability to follow specific instructions, monitor their symptoms and keep up with many different medications,” said Supriya Shore, MBBS, MSCS, first author and clinical assistant professor of internal medicine-cardiology at University of Michigan Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Seeing this cognitive decline among patients, and how it worsens over time after a diagnosis of heart failure, should be a warning for providers to assess a patient’s cognitive ability early and factor it into the care plan.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typical risk factors for cognitive impairment, such as high blood pressure and heart attack, did not explain the accelerated decline observed in the participants with heart failure, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest decrease in global cognition — a composite of several features of cognitive ability, including attention and problem solving — occurred among older adults, women, and white participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators say, based on their findings, that adults with heart failure would reach the threshold for meaningful decline in global cognition nearly six years earlier than people without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executive functioning would diminish around four-and-a-half years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Regular cognitive monitoring of older adults with heart failure would help identify individuals with the earliest signs of cognitive decline who require supportive care,” said senior author Deborah A. Levine, M.D., M.P.H., professor of internal medicine and neurology at U-M Medical School. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need a better understanding of the mechanisms driving accelerated cognitive decline after heart failure to develop interventions that halt or slow the decline.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decisions about treatment, Shore says, are complex and highly dependent on cognitive capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings likely also explain the results of a 2024 qualitative study led by Shore which found that most patients with heart failure displayed a poor understanding of their prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caregivers, on the other hand, commonly identified when a patient was declining in health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some participants said their physicians avoided these conversations, while others said they were confused by the provider’s medical jargon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people with heart failure, as well as their care partners, want discussions around prognosis to begin early in the course of the disease and to be repeated routinely using patient-centered language,” Shore said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They want to speak candidly about quality of life and survival assessments. Even though these conversations are tough, people want to have it. With what we know about the rate of cognitive decline in this patient population, there is a major need to meet patients where they are with clarity and compassion to improve overall care in heart failure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional authors&lt;/strong&gt;: Hanyu Li, M.S., Min Zhang, Ph.D., Rachael Whitney, Ph.D., Brahmajee K.

We assessed whether incident HF is associated with changes in cognition after accounting for pre-HF cognitive trajectories and known determinants of cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;METHODS:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pooled cohort study included adults without HF, stroke, or dementia from 6 US population-based studies from 1971 to 2019. Linear mixed-effects models estimated cognitive change with incident HF diagnosis and the rate of cognitive change over the years after HF, controlling for pre-HF cognitive trajectories and participant factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outcomes included change in global cognition (primary outcome), executive function, and memory (secondary outcomes). Cognitive outcomes were standardized to a &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; score metric (mean [SD], 50 [10]); a 1-point difference represented a 0.1-SD difference in cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;RESULTS:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We included 29 614 adults (mean [SD] age was 61 [10] years, 55% female, 70% White). During a median follow-up of 6.6 (Q1–Q3, 5.0–19.8) years, 1407 (5%) adults received an incident diagnosis of HF. Incident HF diagnosis was associated with initial decreases in global cognition (−1.1 points [95% CI, −1.4 to −0.8]) and executive function (−0.6 points [95% CI, −1.0 to −0.3]). Larger decreases in global cognition after HF were seen with older age, female sex, and White race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants with incident HF diagnosis demonstrated faster and long-term declines in global cognition (−0.1 points per year [95% CI, −0.2 to −0.1]) and executive function (−0.2 points per year [95% CI, −0.2 to −0.1]). The change in memory with incident HF diagnosis was not statistically significant but showed a similar trend with an initial decline of −0.5 points (95% CI, −1.4 to +0.3) and a slope of −0.1 points per year (95% CI, −0.3 to 0.0).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;CONCLUSIONS:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this pooled cohort study, incident HF diagnosis was associated with initial decreases in global cognition and executive function and faster, persistent declines in these domains at follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 12:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTFA2aTNzXzkzQlJuRzQ5RWp5NWlTeGV6R0NCLWF6UkhZaFI0UmRhd1hRMUZSODctOGRxYU9nRWNVUUxzQ3FCZnZDN3ZVQ2V4c2ZkekdKcGIyZUtXZVZyM3RXLXBMQXY5YW9OcnRDbk02VjVPWWY5VkJIYXdYcw</guid></item><item><title>The Best Protein Powders, Tested and Tasted - WIRED</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYEFVX3lxTE9NakdHRlBDbzFDU0FSTFRpcmdWdDBXU3RIS3pEa2xkclN4aDNUd296dGs3SHRSX2c4NVFPMm1md1QtcDBabTBZcHZYaW5peVJibW12d3ZoTXVXN0o5Vnc4Qw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Honorable Mentions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="AssetEmbedWrapper-eVDQiB byBkf asset-embed"&gt;&lt;p class="CaptionWrapper-jSZdqE fJvQtP caption AssetEmbedCaption-fNQBPI dDrfgT asset-embed__caption" data-testid="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;span class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ CaptionCredit-ejegDm iUEiRd isTgyB fNaHcW caption__credit"&gt;Photograph: Boutayna Chokrane&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a data-offer-url="https://www.sakara.com/products/protein-greens-super-powder/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/ZxssCo8SeuM627f18d1ZXHgomAjC2NJb78R5CFDgdcXnYVEvyVuX5Vj11VLgtZoC6j3UUcYNG47Uo6qi6LrfkUUHTU6qfV75xf5CFipnXJV6U8utq6PtUwXPcLoRFXKL4Bd7KgdNM4P3TaXW38wNwuV8M4JkPoRpAv4XRrUJC4zmuy8joL3Y"}' href="https://cna.st/affiliate-link/ZxssCo8SeuM627f18d1ZXHgomAjC2NJb78R5CFDgdcXnYVEvyVuX5Vj11VLgtZoC6j3UUcYNG47Uo6qi6LrfkUUHTU6qfV75xf5CFipnXJV6U8utq6PtUwXPcLoRFXKL4Bd7KgdNM4P3TaXW38wNwuV8M4JkPoRpAv4XRrUJC4zmuy8joL3Y" rel="sponsored" target="_blank"&gt;Sakara Protein + Greens Super Powder for $90&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; With 17 grams of plant-based protein per serving, Sakara's Protein + Greens is just thr3e shy of the 20-gram benchmark we aim for.

This mass gainer packs 1,200 calories per serving, with 50 grams of protein and 215 grams of carbohydrates. Its protein blend includes whey concentrate, casein, milk protein isolate, whey protein isolate, hydrolyzed whey isolate, and micellar casein, so you get a mix of fast and slow-digesting proteins. It also delivers 450 milligrams of calcium and 880 milligrams of potassium, which is a bonus if you want to squeeze in some micronutrients. It tastes great—the strawberry milkshake flavor is spot-on—but these are two scoops at 310 grams, so you'll need to be comfortable with the jumbo serving size. I can't fully endorse the formula because it's packed with artificial sweeteners like sucralose and acesulfame potassium, as well as some iffy additives including maltodextrin and a gum blend (cellulose, guar, gum Arabic, and xanthan) that might not sit well with everyone.

&lt;p&gt;In a groundbreaking development for male contraception, &lt;strong&gt;YCT-529&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;first hormone-free male birth control pill&lt;/strong&gt;, has entered human clinical trials. This innovative pill has shown impressive results in animal studies, proving 99% effective in preventing pregnancies without any side effects. Furthermore, it is fully reversible, offering a new, non-invasive contraceptive option for men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Revolutionary Step in Male Contraception&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Currently, men only have two FDA-approved contraceptive options: &lt;strong&gt;condoms&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;vasectomies&lt;/strong&gt;. However, &lt;strong&gt;YCT-529&lt;/strong&gt; presents an alternative that could revolutionize male contraception. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developed by researchers at the University of Minnesota College of Pharmacy in partnership with &lt;strong&gt;Columbia University&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;YourChoice Therapeutics&lt;/strong&gt;, this hormone-free pill targets sperm production, preventing pregnancy without altering hormone levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43856-025-00752-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Communications Medicine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, highlights its promising potential. The new drug could soon provide men with more control over family planning, expanding their reproductive options.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;99% Effective and Fully Reversible: Promising Animal Trial Results&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results from animal trials have been nothing short of remarkable. &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/02/first-ever-mice-born-from-two-fathers-survive-to-adulthood/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="77985" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;In testing with male mice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;YCT-529&lt;/strong&gt; was found to be 99% effective in preventing pregnancies within four weeks of use. It also showed similar results in male non-human primates, reducing sperm counts significantly within just two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most exciting is the drug’s reversibility: mice regained fertility within six weeks of stopping the drug, and non-human primates saw their sperm counts return to normal in 10 to 15 weeks. Importantly, no side effects were detected in either group, paving the way for its potential use in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The research was led by &lt;strong&gt;Gunda Georg&lt;/strong&gt;, a professor in the College of Pharmacy, who emphasized the importance of this development, stating, “A safe and effective male pill will provide more options to couples for birth control. It will allow a more equitable sharing of responsibility for family planning and provide reproductive autonomy for men.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What’s Next for YCT-529: The Road to Human Use&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the successful completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial in 2024, &lt;strong&gt;YCT-529&lt;/strong&gt; is currently undergoing further testing for safety and efficacy. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?cmd=search&amp;amp;term=Nadja+Mannowetz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nadja Mannowetz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, lead author of the study and co-founder of &lt;strong&gt;YourChoice Therapeutics&lt;/strong&gt;, highlighted the urgency of expanding contraceptive options, saying, “With the unintentional pregnancy rate at nearly 50% in the U.S. and globally, we need more contraceptive options, particularly for men.” T&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

While some of these microbes cause illness and disease (such as bacteria and viruses), others are friendlier to us and help keep us in good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; is one of these friendly bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have known for years that &lt;em&gt;A muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; is associated with good health. One of the important roles it plays in our gut is maintaining the function of our gut barrier. This keeps the bad bugs out while making sure we can still absorb the important nutrients from our diet that keep our cells working as they should. But when there’s an imbalance of &lt;em&gt;A muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; in the gut, it can lead to problems with our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This unusual bacteria lives in our large intestine and survives off of mucin — the layer of mucus that covers the large intestine’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mucin provides a small but important separation between the human cells and microbial cells that call the large intestine home. If this mucus layer is disrupted, microbes can come into direct contact with the human cells. This may result in inflammation as the human cells react to the bacteria – potentially leading to the development of disease, such as inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 WWPRF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; is a very fussy eater. It only uses the glycoproteins (molecules containing protein and carbohydrates) in mucin as an energy source. But just how this bacteria extracted energy from glycoproteins was a mystery until recently. Research conducted by myself and colleagues discovered that &lt;em&gt;A muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; deploys a range of different enzymes that work together in order to unlock the sugar found in mucin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mucin taken from a pig, we analysed both enzyme activity on the surface of cells alongside their genes to understand which enzymes were involved in breaking the glycoproteins in mucin down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We discovered that &lt;em&gt;A muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; uses 66 different enzymes to extract the important energy it needs from the glycoproteins in order to do its important work. We are the first group to describe this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 zUwUc"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Important for health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies looking at &lt;em&gt;A muciniphila’s&lt;/em&gt; interaction with the immune system in mice have revealed that it calms the immune system down and may prevent obesity and diabetes from developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have highlighted specific peptides (a type of molecule) that it secretes which have this effect on the immune system. Due to its friendly nature and calming effect on the immune system, &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; has even been used to develop probiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have also found that people who have a metabolic disease, such as diabetes or fatty liver disease, have fewer &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; in their large intestine. The more lean and athletic you are, the more &lt;em&gt;A muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; you have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; only eats mucus, our diet does still affect it – though indirectly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colon-dwelling bacteria such as &lt;em&gt;A muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; use the carbohydrates they extract from the fibre-rich foods in our diet as fuel. In return they produce substances called short-chain fatty acids. These compounds feed the top layer of human cells in the colon. In fact, 10 per cent of our energy comes from this process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 IoAJj sc-482ou5-3 dzDedB image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 bZqoQk"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 hHPRtA"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2024/09/17/11/17100157-a358f39b-41f6-4269-8a78-7a4bec26d344.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2024/09/17/11/17100157-a358f39b-41f6-4269-8a78-7a4bec26d344.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2024/09/17/11/17100157-a358f39b-41f6-4269-8a78-7a4bec26d344.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The bacteria lives in the large intestine" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 cpasWE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 cwDkqf edasoI" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base-light"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 iwFOdi inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-24283"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 vXhNB"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bWFKX dpkjCF"&gt;The bacteria lives in the large intestine&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; also supports other bacterial species in the microbiome by giving them broken-up mucus so they can survive – a process known as “cross feeding”. But, if we don’t eat enough fibre as part of our diet, mucins become a much more heavily used source of nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can lead to the depletion of the large intestine’s mucus layer – throwing the microbiome’s delicate ecosystem out of balance. This increases the chance of developing inflammatory diseases. So, although &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; is not a pathogen, it can remove too much mucus under the wrong conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research is the first complete example of how mucus is broken down by this bacterial species. It’s important to understand this process, as it’s key in the way our microbes interact with each other – and with us. The enzymes that we described from &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; can now also be used as tools to analyse how these complex mucin structures vary across different body sites and between people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more researchers learn about &lt;em&gt;Akkermansia muciniphila&lt;/em&gt; and the other microbes that live in the colon, the more we understand the importance of eating a variable, high-fibre diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 WWPRF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lucy Crouch is a Research Fellow at the Institute of Microbiology and Infection, Department of Microbes, Infection and Microbiomes, School of Infection, Inflammation and Immunology, College of Medicine and Health at University of Birmingham.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

&lt;p&gt;A breakthrough study suggests that &lt;strong&gt;cannabis-derived&lt;/strong&gt; compounds, known as &lt;strong&gt;terpenes&lt;/strong&gt;, may provide a new solution for chronic pain relief, potentially reducing reliance on &lt;strong&gt;opioids&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Conducted by researchers at the University of Arizona Health Sciences, the research focuses on terpenes from the &lt;em&gt;Cannabis sativa&lt;/em&gt; plant and their ability to alleviate pain without the &lt;strong&gt;psychoactive effects&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;THC&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Terpenes: A Promising New Approach to Pain Relief&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cannabis &lt;strong&gt;terpenes&lt;/strong&gt; have long been recognized for their distinctive aromas and flavors, but recent research is highlighting their potential &lt;strong&gt;therapeutic properties&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;According to a&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43440-024-00687-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;study published in&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Pharmacological Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researchers tested four key terpenes found in moderate to high levels in cannabis: &lt;strong&gt;geraniol&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;linalool&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;beta-caryophyllene&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;alpha-humulene&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These compounds were tested in mouse models of post-surgical and fibromyalgia pain, showing significant pain relief with &lt;strong&gt;geraniol&lt;/strong&gt; standing out as the most effective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Exploring the pain-relieving effects of terpenes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study builds on prior research by Dr. &lt;strong&gt;John Streicher&lt;/strong&gt;, a member of the &lt;strong&gt;Comprehensive Center for Pain &amp;amp; Addiction&lt;/strong&gt;. Dr. Streicher explained that their research showed that while terpenes are not effective for treating &lt;strong&gt;acute pain&lt;/strong&gt;, such as that from an injury like stubbing your toe, they are highly beneficial for managing chronic or pathological pain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In this case, the terpenes were able to significantly reduce pain in models of &lt;strong&gt;fibromyalgia&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;post-surgical pain&lt;/strong&gt;, which are both chronic conditions characterized by long-lasting pain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fibromyalgia&lt;/strong&gt;, a&lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/02/straight-out-of-a-sci-fi-nightmare-scientists-just-created-a-robot-that-bleeds-and-even-dies-if-you-stab-it/" data-type="post" data-id="81017"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;chronic &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/02/straight-out-of-a-sci-fi-nightmare-scientists-just-created-a-robot-that-bleeds-and-even-dies-if-you-stab-it/" data-type="post" data-id="81017"&gt;musculoskeletal&lt;/a&gt; disorder affecting up to 5% of the global population, has limited treatment options. With current therapies proving insufficient for many sufferers, the findings from this study are especially important. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, post-surgical pain, while typically temporary, can lead to long-term complications due to physiological changes such as increased &lt;strong&gt;inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;. By offering an alternative to &lt;strong&gt;opioids&lt;/strong&gt;, these findings suggest that terpenes could play a critical role in improving pain management outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Beyond opioids: The potential for safer pain management&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the most promising aspects of this research is the potential for &lt;strong&gt;terpenes&lt;/strong&gt; to replace &lt;strong&gt;opioids&lt;/strong&gt;, especially for post-surgical pain relief. &lt;strong&gt;Opioids&lt;/strong&gt;, while effective, come with severe side effects, including &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/03/how-often-you-go-to-the-bathroom-could-reveal-hidden-health-risks-new-study-says/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="84244" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;constipation &lt;/a&gt;and a risk of &lt;strong&gt;addiction&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; As Dr. Streicher pointed out, while opioids are effective in controlling post-surgical pain, they often lead to complications. The study suggests that terpenes could provide a novel and safer therapeutic option for pain relief following surgery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Globally, millions of surgeries are performed each year, with post-surgical pain management being a critical area of concern. As Dr. Streicher noted, “&lt;strong&gt;We are always looking for better options&lt;/strong&gt;,” and this research shows that terpenes could provide a safer, &lt;strong&gt;non-addictive&lt;/strong&gt; alternative to traditional opioid treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A promising path forward for natural medicines&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research conducted by Dr. Streicher and his team highlights the untapped potential of natural plant compounds. As &lt;strong&gt;Todd Vanderah&lt;/strong&gt;, PhD, director of the &lt;strong&gt;Comprehensive Center for Pain &amp;amp; Addiction&lt;/strong&gt;, explained: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nature is incredible at making unique chemical structures, and many of these chemicals are unknowns when it comes to their abilities to aid in human health, diseases, and disorders.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terpenes&lt;/strong&gt; work through the &lt;strong&gt;adenosine A2a receptor&lt;/strong&gt;, a pathway also targeted by caffeine, suggesting a &lt;strong&gt;sedative effect&lt;/strong&gt;. This mechanism of action could be further explored in future studies to understand its full potential in managing &lt;strong&gt;chronic pain&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research also opens the door to further discoveries in natural medicine, with the possibility of finding more compounds that could address unmet medical needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

They’ve revived a cultural fervor for thinness that has been blamed for everything from &lt;a href="https://www.thedrinksbusiness.com/2025/01/ozempic-partly-to-blame-for-wine-bar-closure-says-owner/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the closure of wine bars&lt;/a&gt; to killing off &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2023/jun/08/ozempic-weight-loss-body-positivity" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the body positivity movement&lt;/a&gt;. What began as a seeming miracle drug posited to help those most in need of losing weight for health reasons has led to a clamor in which &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/10/health/ozempic-glp-1-survey-kff/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;one in eight Americans have tried the drugs&lt;/a&gt; and telehealth companies have offered cheaper off-brand versions with very little oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Ozempic (the brand name for semaglutide) and other GLP-1s mimic a natural hormone in the body, stimulating insulin and slowing the rate of stomach emptying after eating, increasing one’s sense of fullness. But the very qualities that make GLP-1s such powerful tools for weight loss also make them potentially dangerous for those who struggle to adequately feed themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SignInGateSelector" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"contentType":"Article","sectionId":"society","tags":[{"id":"society/eating-disorders","type":"Keyword","title":"Eating disorders"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","type":"Keyword","title":"Health &amp;amp; wellbeing"},{"id":"society/health","type":"Keyword","title":"Health"},{"id":"society/mental-health","type":"Keyword","title":"Mental health"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","type":"Keyword","title":"Life and style"},{"id":"society/society","type":"Keyword","title":"Society"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","type":"Keyword","title":"US news"},{"id":"science/drugs","type":"Keyword","title":"Drugs"},{"id":"type/article","type":"Type","title":"Article"},{"id":"tone/features","type":"Tone","title":"Features"},{"id":"profile/hannah-seo","type":"Contributor","title":"Hannah Seo"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/us-features","type":"Tracking","title":"US Features"},{"id":"tracking/commissioningdesk/east-coast-features","type":"Tracking","title":"East coast features"}],"isPaidContent":false,"isPreview":false,"host":"https://www.theguardian.com","pageId":"society/2025/apr/04/ozempic-semaglutide-eating-disorders","idUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com","switches":{"lightbox":true,"prebidCriteo":true,"externalVideoEmbeds":true,"personaliseSignInGateAfterCheckout":true,"abSignInGateMainVariant":true,"prebidAppnexusUkRow":true,"prebidMagnite":true,"commercialMetrics":true,"prebidTrustx":true,"scAdFreeBanner":false,"adaptiveSite":true,"prebidPermutiveAudience":true,"compareVariantDecision":false,"enableSentryReporting":true,"lazyLoadContainers":true,"ampArticleSwitch":false,"remarketing":true,"articleEndSlot":true,"keyEventsCarousel":true,"registerWithPhone":false,"darkModeWeb":true,"targeting":true,"remoteHeader":true,"slotBodyEnd":true,"ampPrebidOzone":false,"extendedMostPopularFronts":true,"emailInlineInFooter":true,"showNewPrivacyWordingOnEmailSignupEmbeds":true,"prebidAnalytics":true,"extendedMostPopular":true,"ampContentAbTesting":false,"imrWorldwide":true,"acast":true,"twitterUwt":true,"abAuxiaSignInGate":true,"abDeferPermutiveLoad":true,"prebidAppnexusInvcode":true,"ampPrebidPubmatic":false,"a9HeaderBidding":true,"prebidAppnexus":true,"enableDiscussionSwitch":true,"prebidXaxis":true,"stickyVideos":true,"interactiveFullHeaderSwitch":true,"discussionAllPageSize":true,"prebidUserSync":true,"audioOnwardJourneySwitch":true,"brazeTaylorReport":false,"callouts":true,"sentinelLogger":true,"geoMostPopular":true,"weAreHiring":false,"relatedContent":true,"thirdPartyEmbedTracking":true,"prebidOzone":true,"ampLiveblogSwitch":false,"ampAmazon":false,"prebidAdYouLike":true,"mostViewedFronts":true,"optOutAdvertising":true,"abSignInGateMainControl":true,"googleSearch":true,"brazeSwitch":true,"prebidKargo":true,"consentManagement":true,"idProfileNavigation":true,"confiantAdVerification":true,"discussionAllowAnonymousRecommendsSwitch":false,"absoluteServerTimes":false,"permutive":true,"comscore":true,"ampPrebidCriteo":false,"prebidTheTradeDesk":true,"newsletterOnwards":false,"youtubeIma":true,"webFonts":true,"liveBlogTopSponsorship":true,"ophan":true,"crosswordSvgThumbnails":true,"prebidTriplelift":true,"prebidPubmatic":true,"serverShareCounts":false,"autoRefresh":true,"enhanceTweets":true,"prebidIndexExchange":true,"prebidOpenx":true,"prebidHeaderBidding":true,"idCookieRefresh":true,"discussionPageSize":true,"smartAppBanner":false,"historyTags":true,"brazeContentCards":true,"remoteBanner":true,"emailSignupRecaptcha":true,"prebidSmart":true,"shouldLoadGoogletag":true,"inizio":true,"europeBetaFront":true,"prebidBidCache":false},"contributionsServiceUrl":"https://contributions.guardianapis.com","editionId":"US"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Some healthcare specialists say that an injection enabling people to eat dramatically fewer calories in a day resembles nothing less than a drug-induced – or at least, a drug-encouraged – eating disorder. Dr Kimberly Dennis, a psychiatrist and expert on eating disorders in the US, is quoted as saying: “&lt;a href="https://x.com/PiersUncensored/status/1795900668609282367" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;These drugs are rocket fuel for people with eating disorders&lt;/a&gt;.” Another doctor told Bloomberg News directly that they had seen patients with &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-12-16/weight-loss-drugs-are-too-easily-prescribed-to-people-with-anorexia?embedded-checkout=true#:~:text=one%20doctor%20calls-,%E2%80%9CGLP%2D1%20induced%E2%80%9D%20anorexia,-after%20taking%20shots" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;“drug-induced” anorexia&lt;/a&gt;. For people who are prone to anorexia, bulimia and other eating disorders, easy access to GLP-1s is causing alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="9eab2a1b-557c-434e-a5ab-1113f1decea2" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":3,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"How I escaped the wild west of #cleaneating Instagram and TikTok","elementId":"9eab2a1b-557c-434e-a5ab-1113f1decea2","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/dec/16/food-nutrition-misinformation-social-media"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Many healthcare professionals are concerned that those with &lt;em&gt;restrictive&lt;/em&gt; eating disorders should not be on appetite-suppressant drugs, says Pamela Keel, a psychologist and eating disorder expert at Florida State University. She says medications should not be being prescribed to help a malnourished person stay malnourished, regardless of their weight. After all, “we are not interested in helping people do a better job of having an eating disorder.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;GLP-1s not only make it easier to restrict consumption by suppressing appetite, they could also encourage other disordered behavior such as purging. Because the stomach empties more slowly on these drugs, it can make it easier to vomit up food, says Keel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A good doctor would be aware of a patient’s history of eating disorders and would be able to take those risk factors into account. However, GLP-1s are increasingly easy to access through telehealth platforms like Hers, Eden and Ro, which only require online consultations. To see just how easy it would be to lie about my own health and my need for these drugs, I went on the website of one well-known telehealth platform. I went through the various intake forms and surveys, telling the truth about my health in all instances but over-reporting my weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;I was quickly approved and charged for compounded semaglutide. At no point was I put in contact with any kind of doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="b68de5a5-f832-482b-abf7-425aadd628ba" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;A banner advertises Ozempic for weight loss in West Virginia.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/Reuters&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The interactions between Ozempic and eating disorders are complex. There are concerns that drug could retrigger a restrictive eating disorder in someone diagnosed with one previously, or even trigger one in someone who hadn’t had one before. Complicating matters is that there is evidence to suggest that Ozempic can be helpful to people with binge eating disorder, and many people who cycle between patterns of restrictive eating and overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Because these drugs are still so new, there’s no longitudinal data on how they affect eating disorders in the long term. One theory of how anorexia is triggered is that calorie restriction and “starvation mode” flips a metaphorical switch in the brain of those who are predisposed, says Terry Schwartz, interim executive director of the Eating Disorders Center for Treatment and Research at the University of California, San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It’s not yet known whether GLP-1s can flip this switch, but there is a medical precedent for this, Schwartz says. The anti-seizure medication Topamax (also known by its generic drug name, topiramate) has side effects of weight loss and suppressed appetite. We now know that this drug can &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25847809/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;increase the risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing an eating disorder. “I saw a number of people … who developed a syndrome like anorexia nervosa on Topamax,” Schwartz says – disordered behaviors that disappeared once they stopped the drug. And this is something scientists are considering as they continue to monitor and study GLP-1s and their effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There is more consensus that these drugs could trigger a relapse in someone who has already suffered from disordered eating. At the age of 30, Lily, a retail worker in Australia, found that climbing even just a few stairs had her pausing to catch her breath. Her body mass had swelled in recent years, but she had put off seeing the doctor even as her fatigue grew heavier and heavier. Even when she started wetting herself she still found it hard to see the severity of her symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;People will never be able to accept their bodies, they’ll always be told, ‘Well, you could be thinner, just use this medicine’&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When she finally went to the doctor in June 2023, Lily was stunned to hear her diagnosis of adult-onset type 1 diabetes. She knew she had been unhealthy, gaining 70kg in the past five years, having developed some binge eating tendencies. But for most of her life, Lily had actually been unhealthily underweight. It seemed unreal that she could develop diabetes so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;To get her diabetes under control, she was told she needed the help of a GLP-1 drug. She told her endocrinologist that she’d had anorexia for over a decade and felt that suppressing her appetite was a bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“He did not give two shits, excuse my language,” Lily says. And so, against the advice of her long-term psychiatrist and dietician, Lily was put on Ozempic. She relapsed immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In Lily’s case, she was lucky that a friend noticed her symptoms and urged her to tell her psychiatrist. Though she is still technically overweight, her psychiatrist helped her pivot to simply maintaining her current weight, which has helped Lily pull herself out of her relapse. She stopped losing weight and stopped weighing herself. She regularly checks in with both her psychiatrist and her dietician to make sure she’s eating enough, even while she remains on Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Lily’s feelings toward Ozempic are complicated. Her blood sugars are down and her cholesterol is at a better place. In contrast to her previous “all-or-nothing” mindset with food, she’s able to eat “normal” meal portions for the first time in her adult life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The Ozempic keeps her urges to binge at bay, she says, and now she doubts whether she can ever go off it. When a hernia repair surgery forced her to pause her Ozempic usage for about a month in June 2024, the ferocity of her returning appetite scared her. “All of my thoughts about food came back exactly the way that they were before, and it was horrifying,” she says. “I felt so out of control and I was miserable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Lily, like many people with eating disorders that don’t fit into neat boxes, is wedged between an urge to binge that is tempered by the Ozempic and the impulse to restrict that the Ozempic enables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="food-noise-and-binge-eating" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;‘Food noise’ and binge eating&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Though anorexia nervosa is probably the most well-known eating disorder, binge eating disorder, which causes compulsive and chronic overeating, is about four times more common in girls and women of all ages than anorexia nervosa and twice as common as bulimia nervosa, according to a comprehensive &lt;a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/striped/report-economic-costs-of-eating-disorders/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Harvard report&lt;/a&gt;. The potential for GLP-1s to help those with binge eating disorder is a source of some optimism. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37990682/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; has started to come out over the past couple years &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214623724000048" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;suggesting&lt;/a&gt; that these drugs could be a valuable tool to curb binges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;GLP-1 is a natural hormone in the body that spikes when we eat a meal. In-progress research suggests that GLP-1 responses are blunted or muted in people with a history of binging, says Keel, so it’s possible these medications could help rebalance their hormone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Megan, a 39-year-old nurse in Jersey City, New Jersey, sought out Ozempic in May of 2023 after struggling with cycles of binging and purging for all of her adult life. She eventually switched to Mounjaro, and the change for her has been dramatic. Before she started taking GLP-1s, Megan would get hunger pangs throughout the day that would consume her mind and affect her body. She would wake up in the middle of the night from the discomfort – and the urges wouldn’t settle until she got up to eat food from the fridge. With GLP-1s all of that went away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a48cc3e4-5c50-49db-9de5-2fd4e61a4fde" data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-1tx6u99"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Advertising for semaglutide injections outside Penn Station in New York in 2024.&lt;/span&gt; Photograph: Richard Levine/Alamy&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Experiencing physical discomfort driving her to binge, and then relief that the medication provided, Megan realized how much of her disorder was a biological condition, and not just a matter of discipline. “I thought it was a willpower issue and I always blamed myself,” Megan says. But all this has “made me forgive myself for what I went through”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;We’ve already seen that GLP-1s reduce “food noise” and people’s preoccupations with eating, so “for somebody who has binge eating disorder, these could be helpful tools,” says Leslie Heinberg, a Cleveland Clinic psychologist and expert in obesity and eating disorders. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37990682/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Preliminary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214623724000048" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; do show that these drugs hold promise in reducing binge eating behaviors, but more research is needed, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="control-and-shame" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Control and shame&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The idea that we need to tame our bodies to be thin dates back to at least the Enlightenment, with distinctly racist roots. It can be traced back to the idea that those in bigger bodies lack self-control and refinement, says Sabrina Strings, a professor of Black studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara who studies portrayals of gender, race and bodies. GLP-1s, she says, provide a medicalized avenue for that control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Control and shame, coincidentally, feature strongly in the mindsets of those with eating disorders, notes Debra Safer, a psychiatrist at Stanford’s medical weight loss clinic. The tension between semaglutides and body acceptance is palpable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This was true for Morgan, a 27-year-old marketing project manager in Chicago. After spending most of her life unhappy in her body and struggling with disordered eating, Morgan began therapy in 2022 where she learned about the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; At Every Size framework, which teaches people to strive for optimal health without focusing on size or weight. Even after a lot of unlearning unhealthy mindsets and learning to appreciate her body, Morgan eventually decided that Wegovy was the right choice for her. “It’s been kind of earth-shattering to admit to myself that it could be something that helps me,” she says. Her decision has sometimes felt like a betrayal of her values, but the relief the medication has brought her is undeniable – her joint pain has been reduced and the noise around food has been reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Lurking underneath the whole conversation of GLP-1s and eating disorders is the difficult truth that cultural fatphobia contributes to the prevalence of eating disorders, says Maria Rago, a psychologist in Illinois and the president of the board of directors for the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders. There are many people who are against these drugs because of how they contribute to the idea that we can and should all be thin, she says – there’s a fear that this will contribute to more eating disorders, and that “people will never be able to accept their bodies, they’ll always be told, ‘Well, you could be thinner, just use this medicine.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;For now, what clinicians can do is what most of them are already doing: screening patients for a history of eating disorders before prescribing GLP-1s. If a patient has an active eating disorder they’ll be sent to treat that first, says Chika Anekwe, an obesity medicine physician at Massachusetts General hospital and an instructor of medicine at Harvard University. But if a patient has just a history of restrictive eating disorder, that won’t necessarily disqualify them from GLP-1 use. It’s a case by case assessment of “do the benefits outweigh the potential risk?” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Lily thinks her doctors “should have been more careful when they prescribed it to me,” she says. “I know that I had diabetes, and that my diabetes was really bad and that I was very sick, but I think they should have been more careful when they prescribed it to me.” Ultimately, however, she is grateful to be on Ozempic. The thought of trying to rein in her binge eating disorder without Ozempic feels scarier to her than what she’s doing now, managing her restrictive impulses while on it. And swirled in with all of this is the misplaced shame and embarrassment of needing to be on Ozempic in the first place, of having lost control to the point of needing medical intervention.

Some 3,500 travelers from the United States contracted dengue abroad in 2024, according to the CDC, an 84 percent increase over 2023. “This trend is expected to continue,” the agency said, noting that Florida, California, and New York, in that order, are likely to see the biggest surges this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;On Thursday, the United Kingdom Health Security Agency &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/travel-associated-infections/travel-associated-infections-in-england-wales-and-northern-ireland-2024"&gt;put out a similar warning&lt;/a&gt;, noting that there were 900 cases of travel-related dengue in the U.K. in 2024, almost 300 more infections than the preceding year. The two reports relayed a similar array of statistics about dengue, its symptoms, and rising caseloads. But the U.K. Health Security Agency included a crucial piece of information that the CDC omitted: It noted &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; cases are breaking records. “The rise is driven by climate change, rising temperatures, and flooding,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;In the past, the CDC has &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2024-DON518"&gt;readily acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; the role climate change plays in the transmission of dengue fever — but the political conditions that influence scientific research and federal public health communications in the U.S. have undergone seismic shifts in the months since President Donald &lt;a href="https://www.alternet.org/2020/11/trump"&gt;Trump&lt;/a&gt; took office. The new administration has &lt;a href="https://grist.org/language/trump-delete-climate-change-words-resilience-order/"&gt;purged federal agency websites of mentions of equity and climate change&lt;/a&gt; and sought to &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00525-1"&gt;dismantle the scientific infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; that agencies like the CDC &lt;a href="https://cfpub.epa.gov/si/si_public_record_report.cfm?Lab=NHEERL&amp;amp;dirEntryId=349333"&gt;use to understand and respond to&lt;/a&gt; a range of health risks — including those posed by global warming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Last week, ProPublica &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/nih-funding-climate-change-public-health#:~:text=the%20audio%20element.-,The%20National%20Institutes%20of%20Health%20will%20no%20longer%20be%20funding,internal%20records%20reviewed%20by%20ProPublica."&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the National Institutes of Health, or NIH — the largest source of funding for medical research in the world — will shut down all future funding opportunities for climate and health research. It remains to be seen whether ongoing grants for research at this intersection will be allowed to continue. A few days later, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced his agency plans to &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/27/hhs-to-cut-thousands-of-workers-in-sweeping-reorganization-00253359"&gt;cull 10,000 people from its workforce&lt;/a&gt;, including new cuts at CDC, an agency that was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/museum/history/our-story.html#:~:text=On%20July%201%2C%201946%20the,from%20spreading%20across%20the%20nation."&gt;established in 1946&lt;/a&gt; in order to prevent a different mosquito-borne illness, malaria, from spreading across the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Taken together, the suite of directives will prevent the U.S. and other nations whose scientists rely on NIH funding from preparing for and responding to dengue fever at the exact moment when climate change is causing cases of the disease to skyrocket. The abrupt subversion of the personnel and institutions tasked with responding to a threat like dengue &lt;a href="https://grist.org/climate-connections-diseases-pathogens/"&gt;bodes poorly for future health crises&lt;/a&gt; as climate change causes carriers of disease like mosquitoes, fungi, and ticks to expand their historical ranges and infiltrate new zones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;“The disease pressure in the last couple of years is very dramatic and it’s going in one direction — up,” said Scott O’Neill, founder of the World Mosquito Program, a nonprofit organization that infects mosquitoes with a naturally occurring bacteria to fight disease in 14 countries. For example, Brazil — the country that consistently registers the highest number of dengue cases — recorded a historic &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/sites/default/files/2025-02/2025-feb-7-phe-epi-alert-dengue-final2.pdf"&gt;10 million cases&lt;/a&gt; last year. The country reported &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971224002637"&gt;1.7 million cases in 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;The two types of mosquitoes that most often infect humans with dengue, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, thrive in the warm, moist conditions made more prevalent by rising atmospheric temperatures caused by fossil fuel combustion. The vast majority of annual dengue cases are asymptomatic, but about 25 percent of people infected, depending on the population, develop symptoms like fever, headache, and joint pain. A small percentage of those cases result in severe sickness, hospitalization, and even death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;The number of severe dengue infections corresponds roughly to the size of the pool of people infected every year. In 2023, when there were &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/dengue-cases-january-december-2023"&gt;6 million total dengue infections&lt;/a&gt;, 6,000 people died. In 2024, a year when there were more than &lt;a href="https://www.paho.org/en/news/10-2-2025-paho-warns-increased-risk-dengue-outbreaks-due-circulation-denv-3-americas"&gt;13 million cases registered globally&lt;/a&gt;, over 8,000 people died. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;There is no cure for dengue. Patients in wealthier countries generally fare better than patients in developing regions with limited access to medical interventions like blood transfusions and places where waves of dengue patients overwhelm already-strained healthcare systems. Two dengue vaccines are available in some countries, but both have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590136224001773#:~:text=However%2C%20they%20are%20not%20able%20to%20provide,immune%20protection%20against%20all%20four%20DENV%20serotypes.&amp;amp;text=Although%20the%20CYD%2DTDV%20(Dengvaxia%C2%AE)%20vaccine%20with%20an,dengue%2Dna%C3%AFve%20children%20below%209%20years%20of%20age."&gt;serious limitations&lt;/a&gt; in terms of efficacy and how long they confer immunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;The NIH began taking climate change and health research seriously in 2021, and the institutes have funded dozens of studies that probe every aspect of the climate-dengue connection since. NIH-funded researchers have sought to understand how warmer temperatures &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39030760/"&gt;shift the geographic ranges of Aedes mosquitoes&lt;/a&gt;, which factors &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10997346/"&gt;predict dengue outbreaks&lt;/a&gt;, and how communities can protect themselves from dengue &lt;a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/GmGqmTX8qkyu3tHPhKUfWw/project-details/10835246"&gt;following extreme weather events&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;These studies have taken place in the southeastern U.S., where dengue is becoming more prevalent, and internationally, in countries like Peru and Brazil, where dengue is a near-constant threat. The NIH has also &lt;a href="https://reporter.nih.gov/search/GxoBnBVl_E-aQDsq_zUazQ/project-details/10995312"&gt;funded studies&lt;/a&gt; that bring the world closer to finding medical and technological interventions: more effective vaccines and genetically engineered mosquitoes that can’t develop dengue, among other solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;“Disease doesn’t have national borders,” said an American vector biologist who has received funding from the NIH in the past. She asked not to have her name or affiliated academic institution mentioned in this story out of fear of reprisal from the Trump administration. “I’m worried that if we’re not studying it, we’re just going to watch it continue to happen and we won’t be prepared.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;Americans aren’t just bringing cases of dengue fever home with them from trips abroad; the disease is also spreading locally with more intensity in warmer regions of the country and its territories. Last March, Puerto Rico &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/28/health/dengue-fever-puerto-rico-emergency/index.html"&gt;declared a public health emergency&lt;/a&gt; amid an explosion of cases on the island. By the end of 2024, Puerto Rico &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39977371/"&gt;registered over 6,000 cases&lt;/a&gt; — passing the threshold at which an outbreak officially becomes an epidemic. More than half of the known infections led to hospitalization. Close to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00523.html"&gt;1,000 cases&lt;/a&gt; have been reported there so far this year, a 113 percent increase over the same period in 2024. California and Florida reported &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/2025/han00523.html#:~:text=In%20the%20continental%20United%20States%20in%202024%2C%20locally%20acquired%20cases,compared%20to%20the%20previous%20year."&gt;18 and 91 locally-acquired cases of dengue&lt;/a&gt;, respectively, last year. California registered its &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7342a4.htm"&gt;first-ever locally-acquired&lt;/a&gt; case of dengue in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;“Dengue is already found in many places in the U.S. that have never seen this disease before,” said Renzo Guinto, a physician and head of the Planetary Health Initiative at the Duke-NUS medical school in Singapore. “To combat this emerging climate-related health threat, U.S. scientists must collaborate with others working in dengue overseas. With no resources and capacity, how can such collaboration occur?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;There are limited non-government sources of funding for climate and health research. The money that is available to American researchers is primarily offered by private foundations like the &lt;a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/media-center/press-releases/2003/09/dengue-vaccine-research#:~:text=SEATTLE%20%2D%2D%20To%20accelerate%20the,to%20support%20the%20Pediatric%20Dengue"&gt;Gates Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://wellcome.org/grant-funding/schemes/infectious-disease-award-understanding-dengue-and-zika-spread"&gt;Wellcome Trust&lt;/a&gt;. The grants these philanthropies offer annually pale in comparison to the &lt;a href="https://factor.niehs.nih.gov/2023/7/feature/1-climate-health-initiative-applauded"&gt;$40 million&lt;/a&gt; Congress made available annually through the NIH for climate and health research in the two years before Trump took office. Researchers will be forced to compete for a small pool of funding in the coming years, which will likely lead to fewer studies and less innovation in the years to come. “The end result will be that much less of this work would be done — we would all tell you to the detriment of Americans long term,” said the vector biologist.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;As dengue spreads with more intensity in the countries where it is already common and slips across borders into zones like North America where the disease is still comparatively rare, it’s clear countries need to expand their arsenals of disease-fighting weapons. But the U.S. appears to be leading a charge in the opposite direction, with thousands of lives at stake. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-default-font-family"&gt;“We’re at a time when we need acceleration of innovation and solutions to very pressing global problems,” said O’Neill, whose organization receives funding from governments around the world, including the U.S. “It’s not the time to let ideology drive science rather than let science drive itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article originally appeared in &lt;a href="https://grist.org/"&gt;Grist&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://grist.org/politics/dengue-climate-change-trump-cuts-nih-funding-mosquito-borne-disease/"&gt;https://grist.org/politics/dengue-climate-change-trump-cuts-nih-funding-mosquito-borne-disease/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grist is a nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future.

He worked in logistics for Amazon, was an avid long-distance runner and used to drive every weekend to see his family back home in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But things changed for the Allentown resident when he contracted COVID around Thanksgiving 2020, possibly from a co-worker. Jimenez wasn’t hospitalized, but he experienced fever, fatigue, and loss of taste and smell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most people with COVID, those symptoms go away fairly quickly or at least subside after a couple of weeks or months. But for Jimenez, it was only the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-yDXFiiit" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_yDXFiiit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noticed his brain just wasn’t working like it used to — he couldn’t keep up with the demanding pace and responsibilities of his job, and after trying to work with his employer, he was eventually let go. With the fatigue, all he wanted to do was sleep most of the time. Visiting his family, what was previously a roughly 90-minute trip, became a nearly all-day affair because he would have to stop to rest every 10-15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It really affected the lifestyle I had,” Jimenez said. “I grew up in Jersey City, New Jersey, close to New York. You’re working at 1,000 miles an hour and that’s pretty much how I grew up. So my way of thinking was always, everything should have been done yesterday, even though I am living today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I went from that to going pretty slow, taking my time to think,” he said. “I couldn’t get a breath, a sentence out the way I’m doing right now. It was more thought out. I had to take a little longer because my lungs were just not expanding as much to get the air that I needed to convey an entire sentence or entire paragraph on a single breath.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jimenez has long COVID, a chronic condition that can occur after a COVID-19 infection, where individuals  have lingering symptoms or changes in their health that last more than three months after the infection ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2022/20220622.htm#:~:text=Overall%2C%201%20in%2013%20adults,long%20COVID%20than%20younger%20adults."&gt;About 7.5% of people who contract COVID experience the condition,&lt;/a&gt; which has been documented in about 5% of the U.S. population. It can affect anyone who develops a COVID infection, including children or people with mild or asymptomatic infections, but &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/covid/long-term-effects/index.html"&gt;certain individuals are more likely to develop long COVID&lt;/a&gt;, including women, people who are  Latino, and those who are unvaccinated against COVID, have underlying health problems or had more severe infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much is still unknown about the condition, in which symptoms can vary widely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jeffrey Jahre, St. Luke’s University Health Network’s chief emeritus of infectious diseases, said there are more than 200 possible symptoms of long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any one of these symptoms or combination thereof can exist in an individual and when you take a look at how it actually manifests itself, it tends to be a fairly unique disease, so you can’t count on every individual that you see having an identical set of symptoms,” he said. “And in fact, you have to be very flexible in understanding that’s the situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Living with long COVID&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the first long COVID symptoms described by people after infection was a lasting loss of taste and smell. For about a year and a half, Jimenez lost those senses, and with them, the joy of eating food. For some, a lack of appetite might lead to eating less, but a cooped-up Jimenez said he began eating as just a thing to do. In conjunction with a previous arm injury and losing the ability to go long-distance running, he wasn’t exercising, either. He gained weight, going from around 200 pounds to 290 pounds. He was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he started being able to taste food again, it was like he had his wish granted by a monkey’s paw — everything tasted or smelled like cleaning detergent. It took another two or three months before he was able to start differentiating between tastes and smells. He said the process was like reprogramming his brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The joy for food never came back fully the way it was before,” Jimenez said. “That took another year and a half before I was able to say, ‘Oh, this tastes amazing. This tastes close to what I recall it way back when.’ But still there’s certain things that I still just don’t have a full grasp of what they are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiomyopathy, which is when the heart weakens and has trouble pumping blood, is another common symptom of the condition. Others are difficulty breathing, scarring of the lungs, fatigue, memory impairment, erectile dysfunction or irregular menstruation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another symptom many face is a mild cognitive impairment — often referred to as brain fog. People experiencing brain fog may have problems with planning, time management, memory and decision-making. Some get lost mid-sentence. Cognitive impairments associated with long COVID are just as debilitating as having blood alcohol content at the legal driving limit, &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0267392"&gt;according to one study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depression and anxiety can also be symptoms associated with long COVID — or they can result from the way the condition affects the lives of those afflicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jimenez said losing his job, his hobby and the other impacts on his life took a toll on his mental health. He said he didn’t realize how serious that impact was until a doctor asked if he had any suicidal thoughts or thoughts of harming himself or others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The way I looked at it was, ‘No I don’t have any problems,’ ” Jimenez said. “But then I thought about it, there came a moment when I was just having one of those episodes. I’m not breathing the way I like. I wasn’t feeling my lungs expanding. I’m not thinking the way I normally think. It used to be someone would ask me something and I would respond in seconds. Now I’m taking my sweet time. I’m not able to taste. What is the point of life?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Because of how disruptive long COVID can be, it is now classified as a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy Vogler, a Bethlehem resident who has mostly recovered from her long COVID symptoms, said the debilitating nature of the condition should not be understated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She considers herself lucky because while long COVID did seriously affect her, with symptoms such as tachycardia, high cholesterol, tinnitus, ear pain and brain fog, she was already retiring from her job as a teacher. She saw firsthand the impact of the condition on others when she tried to start a long COVID support group in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We had eight people, but each person only made it to two or three meetings, and I think that’s because they felt so sick. There’s one young woman, she was delightful but she was bedridden. Her long COVID was presenting almost as if she had chronic fatigue, and she needed a ride so she only made it to two. She wanted to come, but she couldn’t physically get out of bed,” Vogler said. “We never had all six people there and then we just stopped it after the run of six or eight weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_7944959" class="wp-caption alignnone size-article_inline"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class=" lazyautosizes lazyload" src="https://www.mcall.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TMC-L-longcovid-1.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" alt="Amy Vogler of Bethlehem talks about how isolating it can be to have long COVID-19 on Tuesday, Sept. 13, 2022, at The Restoration Space in Bethlehem." data-sizes="auto" data-src="https://www.mcall.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TMC-L-longcovid-1.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1" data-attachment-id="7944959" data-srcset="https://www.mcall.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TMC-L-longcovid-1.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 620w,https://www.mcall.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TMC-L-longcovid-1.jpg?fit=780%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 780w,https://www.mcall.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TMC-L-longcovid-1.jpg?fit=810%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 810w,https://www.mcall.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TMC-L-longcovid-1.jpg?fit=1280%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 1280w,https://www.mcall.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TMC-L-longcovid-1.jpg?fit=1860%2C9999px&amp;amp;ssl=1 1860w"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Amy Vogler of Bethlehem talks about how isolating it can be to have long COVID-19 on Tuesday, Sept. 13, 2022, at The Restoration Space in Bethlehem.

(Rick Kintzel / The Morning Call)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Treating long COVID&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five years since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are still many mysteries about long COVID-19. The biggest one is what actually causes it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2"&gt;A 2023 analysis&lt;/a&gt; showed that  those who have suffered a COVID-19 infection can exhibit hidden battle scars such as changes in the immune and nervous systems, loss of brain mass or organ damage. However, the mechanisms by which the infection brings about these changes are unknown. Possible causes suggested by doctors and researchers include inflammation, COVID-19’s persisting in certain body tissues, immune system malfunction, and the infection’s damaging the microbiome, along with others. However, none has been proven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Diana Farrell, a doctor of internal medicine at Lehigh Valley Health Network, part of Jefferson Health, and director of Lehigh Valley Home Care, said there are no diagnostic tests or blood work that can be done to help diagnose long COVID. Since fewer people are testing for COVID and most patients come in well after an infection has subsided, COVID tests also are not a standard part of diagnosing long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And because the condition varies so much from individual to individual, diagnosing long COVID is not a straightforward process. Farrell said most of the time, patients who come to her don’t even know they have long COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Patients just present with this overall, ‘I’m not feeling well. And can you help me figure out what’s going on?’,” Farrell said. “A lot of times you’ll get someone saying, ‘I’m just exhausted. I do some exercise and then two days later I can’t get out of bed’; ‘I have this cough that won’t go away’; ‘Things in my head just aren’t clicking the way they used to.’ The differential, which is the amount of things that we are considering as possible diagnoses in these patients, is very wide when they come to our office.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said because long COVID isn’t always at the forefront of many physicians’ minds it can be overlooked or misdiagnosed, but ruling out other conditions is a mandatory part of diagnosing the condition. And because of how many body systems can be affected, a multidisciplinary approach is necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pulmonologists help determine if patients have long COVID secondary to lung problems. Cardiologists help determine if part of a patient’s long COVID has caused their heart to weaken or beat irregularly, or if there are other heart and vascular problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people with the condition can recover or improve the presentation of their symptoms, especially after targeted rehab and therapy. However, while there are many cases of people recovering from long COVID, there is no firm established timeline for when people can expect to get better, said Elizabeth McCormick, outpatient physical therapy program coordinator for St. Luke’s. She said some get better after one to two months of targeted therapy, but that is not universal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farrell said most patients hit a plateau in their symptoms at some point, where any more recovery or improvement in symptoms is small and slower coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like diagnosing long COVID can require a multidisciplinary response, treating and rehabilitating patients often does as well. McCormick said patients start with a physical therapist who determines if they also need to see an occupational therapist for cognitive or vision-related problems. Patients also are screened for depression and anxiety and referred to services that can help with those problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment plan is individualized for each patient but some things are pretty standard across all long COVID patients, McCormick said. To deal with fatigue, patients are given an aerobic and cardiovascular exercise plan. For brain fog, patients are offered occupational speech therapy to help them manage and navigate situations where brain fog arises and improve cognitive function. Patients also are given resources to help them improve sleep, nutrition and hydration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even people who have lost their senses of smell and taste may be able to recover it through specific therapies, such as olfactory education, which exposes patients [to especially potent scents ones such as citrus, peppermint or lilac.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farrell said treatment, especially if it involves exercise, needs to strike a fine balance as patients can overdo it. She said patients need to start slowly and ramp up intensity over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That is going to prevent them from getting post-exertional malaise but also prevent them from getting further deconditioning or deterioration of their body secondary to this more sedentary lifestyle, Farrell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Recovery&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vogler said her recovery was aided by being open to experimenting with alternative treatments like acupuncture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think I really created a team of support professionals besides my doctors … ,” Vogler said. “My doctors were on board, but then I had to find all the other supports and pull that together. And I would talk to my care team, and for me, I feel that made a difference.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jimenez said Farrell and his other care providers really helped as he recovered. Because he lost his sense of smell and taste, there were times he felt paranoid and like he could not trust the world around him. Being referred to therapy where he learned breathing techniques helped him get better at coping with his challenges and stay calm and level-headed when he felt anxious, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Jimenez is back down to 215 pounds, his blood pressure and diabetes are under control and, though there are times where the brain fog still affects him, episodes are far less frequent, and he has learned how to deal with them when they arise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though his lung capacity still isn’t what it was five years ago, he’s found a new hobby to keep him active — walking. He’s working — doing ride-sharing for Uber and Lyft — has recently become licensed to sell life insurance, and plans to become licensed to sell financial securities and investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said dealing with his condition and learning breathing techniques from his counselor have made him a more patient person, especially when dealing with rude customers and bad drivers while ride-sharing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have to learn how to calm yourself down,” he said. “For me, I was thankful for that. I didn’t want COVID. I didn’t want any of the things that happened with COVID, but I got something good out of it, in the sense of being able to manage how do I control those moments where I get a little upset because someone says something or people are just doing dumb things. I’ll go back to my breathing techniques. This is a wonderful thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jimenez said others with long COVID should not give up — there are resources out there to help them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Just push forward,” he said. “You’re not alone.”&lt;/p&gt;

The woman on the other end of the line was quiet for a moment, then said: “OK, I’ll go, but I don’t need an ambulance. I have a friend who can take me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The 73-year-old woman called her closest neighbor, who lived a half a mile down the road in the rural village Salisbury, Conn. They talked every day, and she had described how tired she felt lately. Her friend encouraged her to call her doctor, even offered several times to take her to the emergency room at nearby Sharon Hospital. The woman always declined — I think I’m feeling better, she would say. But now even she had to acknowledge that she did not look or feel like the person she’d been — someone who, until she retired two years earlier, taught science to rowdy middle schoolers. Finally, she said when her friend answered the phone, she was ready to go to the E.R.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The woman wasn’t sure when she started to feel bad; a month ago, maybe two. “At my age,” she told me recently, “you can’t expect to feel good every day.” But a couple of weeks before the call from her doctor, something happened to make her wonder if her symptoms were about more than just getting older. It was early on a morning in June, and she had come to the veterinarian’s office to pick up a medication for her elderly dog. On the way back to her car, she ran into a friend, and as they stood chatting casually about dogs and children, the woman suddenly turned pale. She swayed dangerously. Her friend grabbed her and, throwing an arm around her shoulder, helped her back into the building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;A veterinary assistant rushed out to help. The woman sat slumped in a chair, her face drained of color, her eyes strangely unfocused. Her blood pressure was abnormally low. As she slowly came back to herself, her first response was embarrassment. She didn’t like being the center of attention, and there she was, surrounded by worried faces. “I’m all right, really I am,” she said over and over. But she knew, and they knew, it wasn’t true. She sipped the water she was given, and color seeped back into her face. When she felt well enough to stand, her friend offered to drive her home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The New York Times</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 09:01:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikAFBVV95cUxPRi1IQ1JKc09icHlyWmcxT1NmRTNtck9ELU5HdHFmd240ZU9HMV9ROWwwb0ZvYnRGenU3eFpPTlZibTI4cGw3Nkh6YTlpNW1RT1FjMmtDQl9CUGo3b1U5bnFEa3dDcVJ4cTNpbnpPSHJDWjM5RU1vMExZR0dpRUV3WG9FUE9HWG9mMWxXS1dkU1k</guid></item><item><title>Science panel’s advice for next dietary guidelines could be on collision course with MAHA - statnews.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMixAFBVV95cUxOZkdmSXVXNXl3OHpVbUpIRDBrWUdERVZrM1RFbzZwWmRqNFdxM2xiTXZIOGdPVjMzQ0h1ZEg0czJNQVVJZENMNWNYRDgybjN2bTlZaEhYVFE5dXF0Ri1RUHpHcEN2YS1kMmFoT0RKMEFXY1VsczdOYUJXbGVhZDNSVjhrVE1PU29xakdNTG9nUmJScEQ4Vkdpam91REctZFRGRVJmMV9ONUJHbWJPR2RGaU01OFR1T2JiTmpZMUkxMlNYa0xD?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Food has been front and center in the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/category/the-maha-diagnosis/"&gt;Make America Healthy Again&lt;/a&gt; movement, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s campaign to solve chronic disease in the United States. That’s why forthcoming federal guidance on nutrition could draw extra attention this time around, even as a &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/27/rfk-jr-10000-job-cuts-hhs-restructuring-health-agency-impacts-cdc-fda-nih-cms/"&gt;massive reorganization&lt;/a&gt; of the nation’s health workforce unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Dietary Guidelines for Americans come out every five years, jointly framed in their final form by federal health and agriculture agencies. The next set is due by December, a year after an outside committee of academic experts reviewed scientific evidence and filed an advisory report. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But on Thursday Kennedy fired a shot at the advisory committee’s report, traditionally the basis of influential government recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We’re in the middle of right now, very, very energetically, revising the nutrition guidelines,” Kennedy said Thursday, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cK0owkN5d-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;TV news pool report&lt;/a&gt;. “There’s a 453-page document that looks like it was written by the food processing industry. And we’re going to come up with a document that is simple, that lets people know, with great clarity, what kind of foods their children need to eat, what kind of foods they can eat.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/11/rfk-jr-maha-commission-meets-for-the-first-time-behind-closed-doors/"&gt;first meeting&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;MAHA Commission&lt;/a&gt; on March 11, it was already an open question as to how closely the 2025-2030 guidelines will hew to the scientific advisers’ recommendations. Their report was framed in terms of equity, a principle the Trump administration has been assailing as unacceptably ideological.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We will make certain the 2025-2030 Guidelines are based on sound science, not political science,” Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a statement released after the MAHA Commission’s closed-door session. “Gone are the days where leftist ideologies guide public policy.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And in the same release, “We are going to make sure the dietary guidelines will reflect the public interest and serve public health, rather than special interests,” Kennedy said. “This is a giant step in making America the healthiest country in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/Part%20B_Ch2_Health%20Equity%20and%20Nutrition_FINAL_508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Scientific Report of the 2025 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee&lt;/a&gt; was the first to apply a “health equity lens” to its review of scientific literature in an effort to ensure all people have access to healthy food. “Equity” is among terms flagged by the Trump administration in actions felt throughout the country.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cycle for new guidance overlaps four-year presidential terms. As one White House administration ended and another one began in January, advice was delivered in December before guidelines become official and after public comments were gathered for 60 days. USDA and HHS will now have until Dec. 31 to release the version that will cover 2025 through 2030.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the stage when the new recommendations go behind the curtain after nearly two years of public meetings about the available research. While never an exact copy of the &lt;a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/Part%20B_Ch2_Health%20Equity%20and%20Nutrition_FINAL_508.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;advisory report&lt;/a&gt;, guidelines that emerge could look markedly different.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And they matter. The final guidelines are more than just advice to a nation experiencing both obesity and poor nutrition. Each iteration sets standards for 16 national food assistance programs, affecting &lt;a href="https://www.fns.usda.gov/about-fns" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;1 in 4 Americans&lt;/a&gt; through what children eat in their school lunches and what families can buy through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), and the nutrition programs for older Americans. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;STAT asked experts involved in the guideline process over the years what they think. USDA did not respond to STAT’s request for comment. HHS public affairs specialist Joellen Leavelle referred STAT to the press release from USDA and HHS; a request for an interview with a member of the MAHA commission drew no response. Advisory committee leaders did not answer emails asking for their thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Barbara Schneeman, a University of California, Davis, professor of nutrition emerita who worked on the 2020-2025 guidelines, did say the final product reflected advice from the expert committee overall, with two notable deviations. While the committee’s analysis of added sugars limited intake to 6% of total energy, the guidelines ultimately said less than 10% of energy intake. Moderate drinking stayed at two drinks per day for men, not one drink or less, as the committee concluded, but there was “added emphasis on reducing alcohol intake,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dariush Mozaffarian, director of the Food Is Medicine Institute at Tufts, has been watching the process over the years, from scientists poring over data and systematic reviews to the eventual food pyramids evolving from USDA and HHS decision makers. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Usually they don’t listen to the report when there’s conflict between eating less of something or avoiding something that’s harmful that could hurt the American food sector, so there’s an inherent conflict of interest,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mozaffarian also noted how the 2020-2025 guidelines had taken less stringent positions than the academic recommendations on drinking and added sugar. Another committee had recommended considering climate issues, but that did not see the light of day, he recalled.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The first stage is completely transparent,” Mozaffarian said. “Then that goes into a completely opaque black box of the agencies who come up with the final dietary guidelines without any public disclosure of what the discussions were, why they made the decision they did, why they listened to or didn’t listen to any particular decision.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;USDA, HHS, and the advisory committee have been criticized for combining potential conflicts of interest in one list for all 20 members instead of by individual disclosure. The 2025-2030 roster includes pharmaceutical companies Abbott, Boehringer Ingelheim, Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Pfizer as well as Beyond Meat, the plant-based meat substitute maker, Dairy Management, and both the American Egg Board and Egg Nutrition. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The sharpest fissure might be the chasm between the advisory committee’s mission to focus on equity and the White House’s imperative to expunge diversity, equity, and inclusion from the government lexicon and funding. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We believe that emphasizing health equity throughout our report can inform the development of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2025–2030, which will support U.S. individuals in meeting their dietary goals,” the report says. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One committee member, Fatima Cody Stanford, said she didn’t see equity as a political issue. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you think about this idea of equity, all we’re thinking about is making sure that all Americans have access to healthy food at all times,” Stanford, an obesity medicine physician and scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital, told STAT. “We don’t care how much money is in your bank account. We don’t care what family you’re born into. We believe that access to a healthy diet is a human right.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That principle has inspired her own family.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As someone whose parents have overseen a food pantry for over 30 years, I can tell you that if you don’t have access to healthy food, you can’t eat healthy,” she said. “You aren’t preventing chronic disease.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Equity is just one of the administration-flagged words throughout the 421-page report, which also analyzed how to meet the needs of people from different cultures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Part of that culturally tailored dietary interventions issue is knowing that I’m going to need to tailor these interventions to fit the person in front of me,” she said about treating her patients for obesity. “Why not do that to ensure the best health outcomes in terms of nutrition for the person in front of me or in front of my dietitians, if that’s going to glean the best health outcomes using the best nutrition for that individual?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stanford pushed back at any suggestion the committee’s work was ideological and not based on science, saying that over 22 months the group looked at more than 6,000 pages of reports, reviewed more than 2,000 new references, and analyzed millions of data points.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When we drew our conclusions, we had to use the literature, not just our own personal beliefs and thoughts and feelings and emotions,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the scientific evidence, Mozaffarian takes issue with the data and systematic reviews supplied to the committee because they are prepared by USDA and HHS. In an editorial &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916524008840?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in January&lt;/a&gt;, he blamed the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2024/10/21/ultra-processed-foods-more-data-needed-before-new-federal-dietary-guidelines/"&gt;exclusion of ultra-processed foods&lt;/a&gt; from the report on a flawed review that led the committee to conclude the evidence was too weak.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;He hopes the final guidelines remove what he calls a “long-outdated fear of dairy fat,” a view &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/03/10/mayo-clinic-research-funded-by-dairy-industry-trade-group-questioned/"&gt;still being debated&lt;/a&gt; but one that may align with Kennedy’s, judging by a visit to a Head Start in Alexandria, Va., after which he &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1902485399743955022?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1902485399743955022%7Ctwgr%5E05ab47f7c16b6c3c72773d3901462a5e77c84c4d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alxnow.com%2F2025%2F03%2F19%2Fsecretary-robert-f-kennedy-jr-visits-local-head-start-program%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;posted on X, &lt;/a&gt;“We are encouraging programs to switch from low-fat dairy — which the antiquated Dietary Guidelines require them to promote — to full fat/whole milk.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“That would be unprecedented for them to just basically pull something out of a hat completely that wasn’t even in the scope of this,” Mozaffarian said. “I’m disheartened by the secretary’s focus on &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/12/are-seed-oils-bad-for-you-examining-science-behind-claims-maha-movement-rfk/"&gt;seed oils&lt;/a&gt;, which are a pretty healthy product.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mozaffarian is more concerned about the lack of funding from the National Institutes of Health for nutrition research, needed to bolster future guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“NIH spends about 4% of its budget on nutrition research and training, and that’s by the most optimistic estimates looking at any grant or project that mentions nutrition,” he said, adding that his research has not been reduced. “I hope my publicly disagreeing on seed oils won’t lead to a cut.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;STAT’s coverage of chronic health issues is supported by a grant from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg Philanthropies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/supporters/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;financial supporters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; are not involved in any decisions about our journalism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p class="hidden paragraph paragraph--type--full-width-image paragraph--view-mode--default"&gt;
          
      &lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;div class="paragraph--type--rich-text-field dropcap"&gt;
      
            &lt;p&gt;The U.S. government's freeze on foreign aid, including funding to fight HIV and AIDS in Africa, has made Simon Bwanya, a Zimbabwean living with HIV, anxious and uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is worried that after the U.S. government finishes its review of &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/feb/28/usaid-funding-health-development-hiv-aids-antiretroviral-mothers-lgbt-sex-workers-south-africa"&gt;foreign aid funding&lt;/a&gt; April 19, it may ultimately stop the supply of drugs and funding for HIV programs and medicines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also worries the decision will cut access to crucial HIV and AIDS treatment and services in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact is already felt, he said, with closures of local clinics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The halting of aid, especially for African health programs, is a constant worry for African Catholic bishops. Cardinal Stephen Brislin, archbishop of Johannesburg, South Africa, said the U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.ncronline.org/news/4-5-usaid-projects-now-canceled-state-department-overseeing-rest"&gt;action under&lt;/a&gt; President Donald Trump is "an enormous tragedy" for Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We have always been grateful to those who give support to the sick and those battling health issues," he told the National Catholic Reporter, adding that "the great tragedy" of the recent cuts from the U.S. is that it was without warning to allow people to prepare and come up with other solutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That has been terribly unfair," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

      
    &lt;/div&gt;

                

                &lt;div class="paragraph--type--rich-text-field"&gt;
      
            &lt;p&gt;John Moffett, CEO of Misean Cara, a faith-based Irish aid group that funds health and development missionary programs in Africa, is similarly concerned about the impact of the cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explained that some health programs that Misean Cara was co-funding together with PEPFAR, the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, had already stopped.&lt;/p&gt;

      
    &lt;/div&gt;

                

                &lt;div class="paragraph--type--rich-text-field"&gt;
      
            &lt;p&gt;"Some of our funding has been used to co-fund HIV programs together with PEPFAR in some African countries. Some of those projects, unfortunately, have had to shut down as a result of the cuts to USAID and we have been very concerned about how those programs are going to continue," Moffett said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Describing this as a "really bad situation," Moffett bemoaned the "limited funding" that Misean Cara is able to secure from the Irish government. He was hopeful though, that "other doors" will open and enable funding into HIV and related health programs in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;

      
    &lt;/div&gt;

                

                &lt;div class="paragraph--type--rich-text-field"&gt;
      
            &lt;h3&gt;Shock and surprise&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four Zimbabweans living with HIV said in interviews that they received the news about the U.S. aid cuts announced in late January through news reports and social media and described it as a surprise and hard to accept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casper Pound, the director of Family AIDS Support Organization which offers HIV and AIDS support services in poor Zimbabwean communities, said the initial blanket suspension of aid by the U.S. affected people living with HIV who were getting their medication from facilities funded by the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There was no time for planning or to make alternative arrangements to collect from other facilities such as government hospitals and clinics. It left people living with HIV in a precarious position and scrambling for solutions but making alternative plans has been difficult because of stigma," he told NCR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"After the stop order, it was difficult for people to go back to the public facilities that they had already circumvented through opting for the U.S.-sponsored facilities. Stigma has increased and anxiety has increased because of the review that the U.S. is undertaking on funding these programs," he explained.&lt;/p&gt;

      
    &lt;/div&gt;

                

                &lt;div class="paragraph--type--rich-text-field"&gt;
      
            &lt;h3&gt;Rare ray of light&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid the gloom, some streaks of bright light have started to emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/emergency-humanitarian-waiver-to-foreign-assistance-pause/"&gt;Waivers in the work stop order&lt;/a&gt; imposed on USAID and PEPFAR programs have started trickling in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is a reprieve for us and for those we care for. Last week I received a text that we have been selected to resume services," a nurse at a facility in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, said in late February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those living with HIV in Harare are still anxious about the future status of supplies. They worry that after the review, access to medication may be suspended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;African governments have tried to allay these fears, explaining that supplies are available to cover the next six months, but this has not completely quelled the anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those living with HIV, like Bwanya, have resorted to WhatsApp groups to correct disinformation being spread due to the lack of adequate official information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he regularly collects information through field visits as part of his efforts to assist members of the organization he formed called the National Network of People Living with HIV in Zimbabwe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There are some positives amid the gloom, anxiety and uncertainty. Nurses have started to go back to work and most of the clinics have reopened and resumed services," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

      
    &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;

Bateman, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Randall J. Bateman, MD&lt;/a&gt;, the Charles F. and Joanne Knight Distinguished Professor of Neurology at WashU Medicine in St. Louis, MO, and co-senior author of this study explained to &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;. “The blood test measures this piece of tau tangles in the blood as a measure of how many tangles are in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“New biomarkers are tools that allow us to track the disease in different ways,” Bateman continued. “Just like doctors use a stethoscope, x-ray, and &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/153201" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:CAT scan;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;CAT scan&lt;/a&gt; to measure different aspects of the disease, these biomarkers enable us to measure different aspects of Alzheimer’s disease. By tracking different processes of Alzheimer’s disease, we can better diagnose, predict and even develop new and better treatments for Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The new biomarker — plasma eMTBR-tau243 — reflects changes in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10932364/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:tau pathology;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;tau pathology&lt;/a&gt; occurring in the clinical symptomatic phase of Alzheimer’s disease and can be used to stage Alzheimer’s disease tauopathy, and to determine if cognitive symptoms are likely due to Alzheimer’s disease tau pathology,” added &lt;a href="https://batemanlab.wustl.edu/people/kanta-horie-phd/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Kanta Horie, PhD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Kanta Horie, PhD&lt;/a&gt;, voluntary research associate professor of neurology at WashU Medicine in St. Louis, MO, and both co-first and co-corresponding author of this study. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Also, many therapeutic developments are ongoing including anti-amyloid and anti-tau drugs.  We believe that this new biomarker becomes the key to establish the plasma biomarkers panel to stage Alzheimer’s disease, which would open the new window of &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319875" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:precision medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;precision medicine&lt;/a&gt; era for Alzheimer’s disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Biomarker up to 200 times higher in late-stage Alzheimer’s&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the study, researchers tested study participants from three main stages of Alzheimer’s disease: presymptomatic, early-stage with &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/memory-loss-and-forgetfulness/what-mild-cognitive-impairment" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mild cognitive impairments;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;mild cognitive impairments&lt;/a&gt;, and late symptomatic disease where participants have been diagnosed with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that blood MTBR-tau243 levels reflected the amount of tau tangles in the brain with 92% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among participants showing cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease, researchers discovered that MTBR-tau243 levels were significantly higher for participants at the mild cognitive stage, and up to 200 times higher for those in the late symptomatic disease stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease is highly associated with (tau) &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9509477/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neurofibrillary tangles;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;neurofibrillary tangles&lt;/a&gt; (NFTs) pathology in (the) brain, not amyloid plaques pathology. Since we know that NFTs are more generated in the dementia stage in Alzheimer’s disease, it is reasonable for us to see the drastic increase of MTBR-tau243 in the dementia stage compared to the preclinical Alzheimer’s disease stage, which suggests the validation to characterize the plasma MTBR-tau243 biomarker as the tau NFTs-specific biomarker.” &lt;br&gt;— Kanta Horie, PhD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The significance of finding increasing amounts of MTBR-243 related to Alzheimer’s symptoms — memory loss and thinking impairment — is (that) this discovery now allows us to track the clinical symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease with a blood test,” Bateman explained. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Blood tests: Next step in Alzheimer’s diagnosis and treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="caas-pull-quote-wrapper caas-img caas-lazy" data-src&gt;&lt;blockquote class="caas-blockquote"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This new blood test can confirm the amount of tau tangles in the brain that helps determine the stage of Alzheimer’s disease and if cognitive decline is likely due to Alzheimer’s disease.

There’s a growing understanding that early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s, which is a complex process, is crucial for effective intervention. Current treatments, while limited, may be more beneficial in the early stages of the disease. A readily available blood test could enable much earlier detection than current methods, allowing for earlier intervention and potentially slowing disease progression.”&lt;br&gt;— Manisha Parulekar, MD, FACP, AGSF, CMD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The initial study needs to be replicated in larger and more diverse populations to confirm its accuracy and reliability across different demographics, ethnicities, and stages of the disease,” Parulekar added. “This includes testing individuals with other neurological conditions to ensure specificity.  Clear and standardized protocols for blood collection, processing, and analysis must be established to ensure consistent and reproducible results across different laboratories and healthcare settings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;View the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/new-blood-test-may-help-diagnose-show-how-far-alzheimers-progressed/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Medical News Today;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 08:06:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5sRXhrdG1pTXhXa0dGSDFaaG10cGlUdm5mdG5kcU9pMHhaaGF4THNkLXVWU2RNT2YwQWZGVmxHSThLTXN6MHJoYk1lMEtNU295d2RXdHZaTWY5RjdXTGM4VUlES3V6LUNWTml6eVhmeEs</guid></item><item><title>Allegheny County sees its worst flu season in 10-plus years - Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxQNUxtVjdKV3Z0cTRYSjdDQTFCaTJneXpibUhlN0JaSzNlOVAtMkxNQnJpd002dTNjX2k0enljYzNUcmFELS1LbGFpRndoTkdWdXpqSURXbHZkWXZ3QlNnVmhlNzZSNTJMSlp0NmlRS2s0YnRtOExDRGt6VERoLWZ0cExWYWZXa2NuaXlLNkxiVmpJM3U2UFpWMUZ5LUVxSVNp?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body class="pgevoke bs-grid pg-hasicomoon pg-site-pg pg-user-checkingstatus pg-requesttype-story pgevoke-pageparentsection-news pg-piano" id="readabilityBody"&gt;

The revolutionary device, in the early stages of development, offers a temporary solution for regulating heartbeats and could dramatically change the future of heart care. The findings have been detailed in a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08726-4" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;p&gt;published in Nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Powered by light and capable of dissolving into the body once no longer needed, this pacemaker marks a significant leap forward in medical technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it would take years before it can be tested in humans, the wireless pacemaker is considered a "transformative breakthrough" which could also pave the way for other advancements in other areas of medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have developed what is, to our knowledge, the world’s smallest pacemaker,” said Northwestern bioelectronics pioneer John A. Rogers, who led the device development. “There’s a crucial need for temporary pacemakers in the context of pediatric heart surgeries, and that’s a use case where size miniaturization is incredibly important. In terms of the device load on the body — the smaller, the better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our major motivation was children,” said Northwestern experimental cardiologist Igor Efimov, who co-led the study. “About 1% of children are born with congenital heart defects — regardless of whether they live in a low-resource or high-resource country. The good news is that these children only need temporary pacing after a surgery. In about seven days or so, most patients’ hearts will self-repair. But those seven days are absolutely critical. Now, we can place this tiny pacemaker on a child’s heart and stimulate it with a soft, gentle, wearable device. And no additional surgery is necessary to remove it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-type="in_view" class="  "&gt;&lt;div class="EEW3_ timeline_pollWrapper_as " data-scrollga="scroll#poll_view"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="hLnAH"&gt;Poll&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="KEEGr"&gt;Do you believe that temporary pacemakers will benefit pediatric patients significantly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A permanent or classic pacemaker is a device that can be placed in your body, usually by surgery, to support the electrical system in your heart. This helps in stabilizing abnormal heart rhythms and preventing problems that can disrupt or endanger your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the difference between a permanent pacemaker and a temporary pacemaker?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, a pacemaker is needed for a short time to assist heart function. This is especially done when heart rate changes owing to open-heart surgery, heart attack, infection, medication or other issues. This kind of pacemaker stays in place until your heart rate is stabilized, typically for just a few days. Permanent pacemaker is implanted only when things don't improve on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another distinctive trait that sets the new pacemaker apart is its ability of being wireless. It's just one millimeter thick and 3.5 millimeters long, and can fit into the tip of a syringe. Besides it doesn't have to be taken out from the body as it is designed to dissolve into the body when no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Temporary pacemakers currently need surgical procedure to sew electrodes onto heart muscles, with wires connecting to a powered device on the patient's chest. When the pacemaker serves its purpose, doctors or nurses pull out the wires, which can at times cause damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How the tiny pacemaker works&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pacemaker is connected to a soft patch worn on the patient's chest, as described in a study published in the journal Nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the patch detects irregular heartbeats, it emits a light signal that instructs the pacemaker on the appropriate heartbeat to stimulate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pacemaker is powered by a galvanic cell, which harnesses the body’s fluids to convert chemical energy into electrical pulses that regulate the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the study, the pacemaker has shown effective results in tests on mice, rats, pigs, dogs, and human heart tissue in the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When are human trials expected to be launched?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Senior study author John Rogers of Northwestern University in the United States told AFP that the pacemaker could be tested in humans in approx. two to three years and his lab has launched a start-up for the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Mixing work with pleasure: This man shows how its done&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Fri, 04 Apr 2025 05:52:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item></channel></rss>
