							&lt;p data-start="301" data-end="361"&gt;Let’s be real: waking up &lt;em data-start="326" data-end="337"&gt;refreshed&lt;/em&gt; is the new luxury flex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="363" data-end="576"&gt;In a world of hustle culture, 5 a.m. club influencers, and productivity gurus downing mushroom coffee, we’ve glorified early mornings—but no one’s talking about the stuff we do the &lt;em data-start="544" data-end="558"&gt;night before&lt;/em&gt; that wrecks them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="578" data-end="866"&gt;Sleep isn’t just about how many hours you get. It’s about &lt;em data-start="636" data-end="641"&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you wind down. And most of us are unknowingly doing things before bed that sabotage our sleep quality. Then we wake up groggy, drag ourselves through the day, and wonder if we need to cut carbs or start microdosing sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="868" data-end="944"&gt;Spoiler: You probably just need to stop doing these seven things before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="951" data-end="1004"&gt;1. &lt;strong data-start="958" data-end="1004"&gt;Doomscrolling like it’s your part-time job&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1006" data-end="1305"&gt;Look, I get it. You open TikTok to check one recipe, and suddenly you’re 43 videos deep into “people who disappeared mysteriously and were never found.” Or worse, the algorithm hits you with a “clean girl” nighttime routine while you’re lying in three-day-old pajamas next to a half-eaten rice cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1307" data-end="1501"&gt;Doomscrolling might &lt;em data-start="1327" data-end="1333"&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like relaxing, but it’s mentally overstimulating. The constant hit of information—news, drama, opinions, memes—keeps your brain in high-alert mode, not wind-down mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1503" data-end="1800"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="1503" data-end="1526"&gt;What to do instead:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="1526" data-end="1529"&gt;Set a “digital sunset.” That means putting your phone on airplane mode or Do Not Disturb 30-60 minutes before bed. Replace the scroll with something analog—a book, journaling, or even stretching. Yes, it’ll feel weird at first. Withdrawal is real. But so is better sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="1807" data-end="1874"&gt;2. &lt;strong data-start="1814" data-end="1874"&gt;Eating late-night snacks that mess with your sleep cycle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1876" data-end="2126"&gt;This one hurts me personally because I’ve been known to do late-night reviews of vegan cheesy puffs. But here’s the truth: what you eat before bed &lt;em data-start="2023" data-end="2032"&gt;matters&lt;/em&gt;. Heavy meals, spicy food, and high-sugar snacks can disrupt your body’s natural sleep rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2128" data-end="2318"&gt;They mess with your digestion, blood sugar, and even core temperature—all things that impact how deeply you sleep and whether you wake up feeling like a slightly haunted version of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2320" data-end="2556"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2320" data-end="2332"&gt;The fix:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="2332" data-end="2335"&gt;If you &lt;em data-start="2342" data-end="2348"&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; snack, stick with something light and sleep-friendly: a banana with almond butter, a few walnuts, or chamomile tea with oat milk. Just don’t turn your bed into a snack lounge. Trust me, crumbs kill the vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="2563" data-end="2605"&gt;3. &lt;strong data-start="2570" data-end="2605"&gt;Drinking alcohol to “wind down”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2607" data-end="2748"&gt;Ah yes, the sneaky one. Alcohol might &lt;em data-start="2645" data-end="2651"&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like a sedative—it helps you fall asleep faster—but it’s actually a sleep disruptor in disguise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2750" data-end="2987"&gt;That glass of wine or nightcap lowers sleep quality, interrupts REM cycles, and often leads to 3 a.m. wakeups with a racing heart and regret. You might fall asleep quicker, but you’ll wake up feeling like you got hit by a kombucha truck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2989" data-end="3208"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="2989" data-end="3013"&gt;What to try instead:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="3013" data-end="3016"&gt;If you want a wind-down ritual, swap the booze for a calming alternative. I’m a fan of magnesium drinks, herbal teas, or even a vegan moon milk blend (yes, that’s a thing, and it’s delicious).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="3215" data-end="3272"&gt;4. &lt;strong data-start="3222" data-end="3272"&gt;Taking your stress to bed with you (literally)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3274" data-end="3328"&gt;You can’t fight cortisol with a lavender pillow spray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3330" data-end="3529"&gt;If your mind is racing with thoughts like “Did I reply to that email?” or “Why did I say that thing in 2017?”—your body isn’t going to shift into sleep mode. You’re still mentally in fight-or-flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3531" data-end="3694"&gt;Many of us go from work to Netflix to bed without ever processing the stress of the day. That unprocessed energy doesn’t vanish—it just keeps spinning until 2 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3696" data-end="3937"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="3696" data-end="3713"&gt;The solution:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="3713" data-end="3716"&gt;Introduce a “mental cleanse” before bed. This could be journaling, breathwork, or a simple brain dump—write down everything you’re thinking, even if it’s chaotic. Let the page hold your stress so your bed doesn’t have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="3944" data-end="4015"&gt;5. &lt;strong data-start="3951" data-end="4015"&gt;Having zero bedtime routine (and thinking it doesn’t matter)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4017" data-end="4075"&gt;Not having a routine is a routine—it just happens to suck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4077" data-end="4261"&gt;Your body thrives on rhythm. If you’re crashing at different times each night, doing random things before bed, and expecting to sleep like a baby, you’re setting yourself up for chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4263" data-end="4354"&gt;Think of your bedtime routine as a signal to your body: “Hey, it’s safe to power down now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4356" data-end="4594"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="4356" data-end="4374"&gt;What to build:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="4374" data-end="4377"&gt;Start small. Choose 2–3 calming things to do every night before bed: light stretching, skincare, reading, or listening to a calming playlist. (I’ve got a lo-fi Spotify mix called &lt;em data-start="4556" data-end="4574"&gt;"Sleepy Peaches"&lt;/em&gt; if you're curious.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4596" data-end="4696"&gt;Once it becomes a ritual, your body will start recognizing the signs—and falling asleep gets easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="4703" data-end="4781"&gt;6. &lt;strong data-start="4710" data-end="4781"&gt;Using your bed as your office, dining table, or social media throne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4783" data-end="5007"&gt;This one’s for the WFH crew and the snackers (yes, I see you). When your bed becomes a place for eating, scrolling, working, and watching YouTube documentaries on mushroom farming, your brain stops associating it with sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5009" data-end="5136"&gt;It’s classic Pavlovian conditioning. If your brain links your bed with stimulation, you’ll lie down and feel wired, not sleepy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5138" data-end="5332"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5138" data-end="5151"&gt;The move:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="5151" data-end="5154"&gt;Reclaim your bed as a &lt;em data-start="5176" data-end="5193"&gt;sleep-only zone&lt;/em&gt;. No laptops. No snacks. No reality TV. Treat your bed like a sacred space for rest—and maybe a little romance, but that’s another article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="5339" data-end="5412"&gt;7. &lt;strong data-start="5346" data-end="5412"&gt;Skipping wind-down movement because you think you’re too tired&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5414" data-end="5654"&gt;Here’s a plot twist: light movement before bed can &lt;em data-start="5465" data-end="5474"&gt;improve&lt;/em&gt; your sleep quality. Many people skip it thinking they need to stay still—but gentle movement can help release tension, calm your nervous system, and transition you into rest mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5656" data-end="5805"&gt;You don’t need to do a full yoga flow. Even 5 minutes of deep breathing while lying on your back with your legs up against the wall can work wonders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5807" data-end="5831"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="5807" data-end="5829"&gt;Try this sequence:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul data-start="5832" data-end="5979"&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5832" data-end="5898"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5834" data-end="5898"&gt;1 minute of box breathing (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5899" data-end="5934"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5901" data-end="5934"&gt;2 minutes legs-up-the-wall pose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li data-start="5935" data-end="5979"&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5937" data-end="5979"&gt;2 minutes of neck or shoulder rolls in bed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5981" data-end="6054"&gt;You’ll be surprised how much more grounded—and sleepy—you feel afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="6061" data-end="6128"&gt;Bonus: The mindset trap of “I’ll just push through it tomorrow”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6130" data-end="6202"&gt;This one isn’t a habit so much as a belief system. And it’s a toxic one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6204" data-end="6410"&gt;The idea that you can always catch up, power through, or caffeinate your way into productivity? It’s a myth. Chronic sleep sabotage catches up with you. You’re not weak for needing good sleep. You’re human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6412" data-end="6590"&gt;&lt;strong data-start="6412" data-end="6440"&gt;Reframing the narrative:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br data-start="6440" data-end="6443"&gt;You’re not being lazy by prioritizing rest. You’re being &lt;em data-start="6500" data-end="6511"&gt;strategic&lt;/em&gt;. Sleep is the foundation for everything else: focus, creativity, energy, mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6592" data-end="6669"&gt;So let’s stop treating it like an afterthought. Let it be the main character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 data-start="6676" data-end="6740"&gt;Final thoughts from someone who’s tried all the wrong things&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6742" data-end="6890"&gt;I’ve spent too many nights up late reviewing vegan protein cookies and convincing myself that three hours of sleep was “fine.” (Spoiler: it wasn’t.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6892" data-end="7169"&gt;But once I started changing these bedtime habits—even just one at a time—I stopped waking up feeling like a knocked-over succulent. I felt rested, energized, even &lt;em data-start="7055" data-end="7064"&gt;excited&lt;/em&gt; to get out of bed. (Which is wild, considering I’m not a morning person unless a new lo-fi album drops.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7171" data-end="7269"&gt;So here’s my challenge to you: pick one of these habits and say goodbye to it this week. Just one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7271" data-end="7295"&gt;Then watch what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7297" data-end="7360"&gt;You might just wake up one morning and realize—you feel &lt;em data-start="7353" data-end="7359"&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7362" data-end="7407"&gt;Like, naturally good. No adaptogens required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="vegou-quiz-after-article" id="vegou-2138231369"&gt;&lt;div&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;The internet's latest health villain has arrived, and it's hiding in your kitchen cabinet. Seed oils—canola, soy, sunflower, and their botanical brethren—are being blamed for everything from brain fog to heart disease. Social media influencers call them the "Hateful Eight," while wellness gurus claim they're more toxic than industrial waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the thing: &lt;strong&gt;the science doesn't back up the hysteria.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's Really Going On Here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anti-seed oil movement gained steam around 2020, largely thanks to carnivore diet advocates appearing on popular podcasts. The basic argument goes like this: these oils are processed with chemicals, they're high in omega-6 fatty acids, and they're supposedly causing widespread inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds scary. Also sounds like the kind of oversimplified narrative that thrives on social media but crumbles under scientific scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Evidence Actually Says...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/06/250621103446.htm" target="_blank"&gt;2025 study analyzing blood markers from nearly 1,900 people&lt;/a&gt; found that higher levels of linoleic acid—the omega-6 fat that seed oil critics love to hate—were actually &lt;strong&gt;linked to lower inflammation&lt;/strong&gt;, not higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/news/2024/08/20/theres-no-reason-to-avoid-seed-oils-and-plenty-of-reasons-to-eat-them" target="_blank"&gt;American Heart Association&lt;/a&gt; states there's "no reason to avoid seed oils and plenty of reasons to eat them." &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/scientists-debunk-seed-oil-health-risks/" target="_blank"&gt;Harvard researchers&lt;/a&gt; have pushed back on claims that these oils cause health problems ranging from headaches to heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more telling: a &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/news/article/seed-oils-facts-myths" target="_blank"&gt;2017 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials&lt;/a&gt; found that increased dietary intake of linoleic acid doesn't significantly affect blood concentrations of inflammatory markers. Only about 0.2% of omega-6s actually convert to the compounds that &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; theoretically cause inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Real Culprits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's what the seed oil panic gets wrong: it confuses correlation with causation. Yes, many foods containing seed oils are unhealthy—think french fries, packaged snacks, and processed junk. But these foods are also loaded with refined carbohydrates, sodium, and sugar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/scientists-debunk-seed-oil-health-risks/" target="_blank"&gt;Harvard's Guy Crosby notes&lt;/a&gt;: "Sure, if you cut back on these foods, chances are you're going to feel better." But it's not the seed oils causing the problems—it's the overall nutritional disaster that is ultra-processed food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Processing Panic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critics often point to hexane, a chemical solvent used in oil extraction, as evidence of toxicity. While hexane can be hazardous in gas form, it's used as a liquid solvent and then evaporated off. The EPA studied hexane extensively in the 1980s and found it safe for consumption in the trace amounts that might remain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, mechanically extracted oils (cold-pressed, expeller-pressed) exist for those who prefer to avoid chemical processing entirely. They're more expensive and have shorter shelf lives, but they're available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://public-health.uq.edu.au/article/2024/02/if-you%E2%80%99re-worried-about-inflammation-stop-stressing-about-seed-oils-and-focus-basics" target="_blank"&gt;University of Queensland's research&lt;/a&gt; puts it best: if you're worried about inflammation, "stop stressing about seed oils and focus on the basics."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those basics? Eat more fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and lean proteins. Reduce ultra-processed foods. Get adequate omega-3s from fatty fish, walnuts, and flaxseeds. Exercise regularly. Manage stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revolutionary stuff, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Political Angle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's worth noting that opposition to seed oils has become oddly politicized. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_oil_misinformation" target="_blank"&gt;Wikipedia documents&lt;/a&gt; how the movement has been "associated with the political right," with some academics describing it as part of "right-wing masculinist discourse."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When health advice becomes a political identity marker, you know you've wandered far from actual science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can seed oils be part of a healthy diet? Absolutely. &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/news/article/seed-oils-facts-myths" target="_blank"&gt;Mass General's research&lt;/a&gt; shows they can be beneficial when used in cooking—stir-frying vegetables, roasting fish, making homemade salad dressings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/nutrition/articles/10.3389/fnut.2025.1502815/full" target="_blank" title=""&gt;systematic review published in Frontiers in Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; found that seed oils from canola, flaxseed, and sesame can positively influence lipid profiles and glycemic control while potentially reducing oxidative stress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Actually Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of obsessing over specific oils, focus on the bigger picture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat mostly whole foods&lt;/strong&gt; rather than processed ones&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Include omega-3 rich foods&lt;/strong&gt; like fatty fish and walnuts&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use a variety of fats&lt;/strong&gt; including olive oil, avocados, nuts, and yes, seed oils&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cook at home more often&lt;/strong&gt; so you control what goes into your food&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seed oil panic is a perfect example of how complex nutritional science gets reduced to clickbait headlines and social media soundbites. While the influencers are busy demonizing canola oil, the real dietary villains—ultra-processed foods, excessive sugar, and overall poor eating patterns—continue doing actual damage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Save your energy for the fights that matter.&lt;/strong&gt; Your health will thank you for focusing on evidence-based nutrition rather than the latest internet panic.&lt;/p&gt;

These individuals also show a stronger preference for stimulating music, regardless of the activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a neurodevelopmental condition marked by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity. It often begins in childhood and persists into adulthood in a significant proportion of cases. Adults with ADHD, especially those with the inattentive presentation, may struggle with sustained attention, task management, and organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disorder is also commonly associated with emotional challenges such as anxiety or depression. While stimulant medication can help regulate brain arousal and improve performance, researchers have also explored alternative strategies to support individuals with attentional difficulties, including environmental adjustments like background music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, doctoral candidates Kelly-Ann Lachance and Pénélope Pelland-Goulet, along with clinical neuropsychologist and full professor &lt;a href="https://www.musec.ca/en/frlaboratoire-musecenmusec-laboratory-english/" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Gosselin&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Montreal, sought to understand how young adults use music in daily life and whether those with ADHD symptoms differ from neurotypical individuals in their listening habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were interested in how young adults with and without ADHD use background music during daily activities, especially those requiring more cognitive effort, since prior lab studies rarely examine real-world listening habits,” the researchers explained. “Given that individuals with ADHD often struggle with attention, we wanted to understand whether they listen to music differently in everyday contexts. This interest was sparked years ago when a parent of a teenager with attention difficulties once asked Dr. Gosselin if letting their child study with music was a good idea—an unanswered question that stayed with her ever since.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team conducted an online survey with 434 participants between the ages of 17 and 30. Participants answered questions about their music listening habits, musical preferences, and the perceived effects of background music on emotional and cognitive functioning. The survey also included a standardized screening tool for ADHD symptoms. Based on the responses, participants were divided into two groups: those who screened positive for ADHD and those who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that most young adults listen to background music during both cognitively demanding tasks—such as studying, problem-solving, and reading—and less demanding ones like cleaning, cooking, and exercising. However, individuals in the ADHD-screened group reported more frequent use of background music while studying and exercising compared to the neurotypical group. They also listened more frequently to music during low-effort activities overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, distinct differences emerged between groups,” the researchers told PsyPost. “ADHD-screened participants not only listened to music more often during study tasks but also preferred stimulating music across both more and less cognitively demanding activities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In contrast, neurotypical participants tended to favor relaxing music during cognitively demanding activities and more stimulating music during less demanding ones. This pattern highlights a clear difference in how music is used and perceived—not just casually, but as a strategy to meet stimulation needs. It was interesting to see that these self-regulatory uses of music are already present in everyday life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings align with existing psychological theories. One of them, the Moderate Brain Arousal model, suggests that individuals with ADHD often experience lower baseline levels of brain arousal. They may use external stimulation—such as music—to help reach an optimal arousal state that supports task engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stimulating music, by activating the brain’s reward system and releasing dopamine, could help compensate for this baseline deficit and reduce tendencies toward mind-wandering or distraction during tasks like studying. In contrast, neurotypical individuals may seek less stimulation and favor music that is more calming or predictable when engaging in complex work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also investigated whether participants believed that background music improved their concentration or mood during cognitive tasks. Using a set of 27 statements, they conducted a factor analysis and identified two distinct dimensions of subjective experience: one related to cognitive functioning and the other to emotional functioning. Most participants reported that music helped with both, citing enhanced concentration and improved mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrary to expectations, there were no significant differences between groups in how they rated the emotional or cognitive benefits of background music. This suggests that despite listening more often to music in daily life, ADHD-screened individuals do not necessarily perceive stronger effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that young adults with ADHD symptoms tend to listen to background music more frequently during activities that demand concentration, and they usually prefer more stimulating music, regardless of the activity type (e.g., more and less cognitively demanding),” the researchers said. “Many participants—both young adults with ADHD symptoms and neurotypical—also reported that music helped them stay focused and improved their mood. This suggests that background music might be a way for some people to manage their attention and emotions in everyday life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers took care to account for potential confounding factors in their analysis. They controlled for variables such as musical training and mood symptoms and found that group differences in listening habits remained significant. For instance, even after adjusting for emotional distress, participants with ADHD symptoms still reported higher music use while exercising or doing simple tasks. This pattern suggests that the behavior is not solely driven by emotional coping but may also be related to attentional strategies or arousal regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are still some limitations to consider. One key limitation was the reliance on self-report data, which may be subject to recall bias or social desirability effects. In addition, the ADHD status of participants was determined through a screening questionnaire rather than a clinical diagnosis. This method may have included individuals with subclinical symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the study adds to a growing body of evidence that music plays a meaningful role in how people manage attention and emotion in daily life. For individuals with attentional challenges, music may serve as a flexible and self-directed tool to help regulate arousal, reduce boredom, and support performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research could build on these findings by using laboratory experiments or examining how different types of music affect cognitive performance and emotional state in individuals with ADHD. Longitudinal studies might also explore how music habits evolve over time or interact with other coping strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the short term, we have just launched a new survey targeting a younger population (ages 12 to 17) to explore their background music listening habits during daily activities,” the researchers said. “In English: https://ls.sondages.umontreal.ca/229667. In French: https://ls.sondages.umontreal.ca/978117.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As for long-term goals, a key next step would be to examine how specific musical characteristics—such as tempo, lyrics, or familiarity—influence attention and emotional regulation in real time. Future research should be interested in developing personalized music-based strategies that could help individuals with attentional difficulties in academic or work settings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings reflect what many people may already sense intuitively: music is not just background noise—it plays a role in how we manage our attention, mood, and motivation,” the researchers added. “Understanding these everyday habits could help guide more individualized and practical approaches to supporting mental health and focus, especially in people with ADHD symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1508181" target="_blank"&gt;Listening habits and subjective effects of background music in young adults with and without ADHD&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Kelly-Ann Lachance Pénélope Pelland-Goulet, and Nathalie Gosselin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2025 18:07:16 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxOWjc0enpKR1RBY3RhaFY1bGZIVzBXWlZfRTRvS0JMN01tdmF4aURyaFZpOUYxRXNsWU9jNVI3WHEtUkk0V2NMd1V4Mm04bmpyNmhfSW5EaGMyeGhIRFhEM21YQzhSMEo4UG9ISzlJWUtXNnpPZVhiQ201U1U1U3dSX3NmY0N0TzNTdlVKOFVJQm1MZ3FPV2tEUmQzd3pDc3M</guid></item><item><title>根据心脏病专家的说法，这是强化心脏的最佳日常习惯- AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE9HWkwyM3dIWjFvSnhtTGNJLWNBNWJXcjRzd21GbENrQzhmWUFsYVJmRzNheDZLVjdHZ3ozTEt0ek82NHc2MHYzdVFtcTR4emNrNmIydFRPS200SkR0Nk1taXJubU5uYUlKZENmTENFUEoyU3hwWTQ0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/best-daily-habit-to-strengthen-heart-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This Is the Best Daily Habit To Strengthen Your Heart, According to Cardiologists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;This Is the Best Daily Habit To Strengthen Your Heart, According to Cardiologists&lt;/a&gt; originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://parade.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be challenging to look too far into the future.

Yet, cardiologists are urging people to think long-term about their hearts, emphasizing that small habits now can add up to a healthier future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/relaxing-habit-harming-heart-health-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Heart health;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Heart health&lt;/a&gt; is driven so much by choices we make daily—what and why we eat and how active we are," says &lt;a href="https://mdschool.tcu.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Mohanakrishna Sathyamoorthy, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Mohanakrishna Sathyamoorthy, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the chair of the department of internal medicine and Burnett School of Medicine and the principal cardiologist with Consultants in Cardiovascular Medicine and Science Fort Worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sathyamoorthy says that intentionally making healthy choices is empowering, as it gives you agency over your cardiovascular health. However, you need to know what to do to do it.

"There is no doubt from my view that bringing weight training is crucial to developing a balanced exercise regimen," Dr. Sathyamoorthy reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no doubt in the American Heart Association's mind either. The organization recommends that adults engage in strength training at least two days per week in its &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/fitness/fitness-basics/aha-recs-for-physical-activity-in-adults" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:guidelines for physical activity;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;guidelines for physical activity&lt;/a&gt;. However, it is often overlooked as people focus more heavily on the also-important recommendations for aerobic activity (150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, you may know that weight training can help build and maintain muscle. The heart is also a muscle. However, pumping iron doesn't benefit the heart in the same way—you're not going to make your ticker bulkier by lifting weights or doing bodyweight squats..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Strength training...can help create a more conducive environment for the heart to work within," explains &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.getcare.tgh.org/providers/debbie-rinde-hoffman-1801899091" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Debbie Rinde-Hoffman, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Dr. Debbie Rinde-Hoffman, MD&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; a cardiologist and vice chief of business development with Tampa General Hospital Heart &amp;amp; Vascular Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, strength training makes the body stronger, and the heart doesn't operate in a vacuum—it benefits too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Strength training can lower weight, improve cholesterol and blood sugar and can improve blood pressure," says &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.northwell.edu/find-care/find-a-doctor/dr-guy-lowell-mintz-md-1508869884" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Guy L.

Mintz, MD&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; the director of cardiovascular health &amp;amp; lipidology for the Sandra Atlas Bass Heart Hospital and North Shore University Hospital. "Weight training builds lean muscle mass, and muscle burns more calories."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mintz notes that this &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1371324/kaitlin-vogel/calories-burned-running/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:calorie burn;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;calorie burn&lt;/a&gt; continues even after the resistance workout (known as the "afterburn effect"). Speaking of "continues," the list of benefits strength training has for heart health doesn't stop there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It also helps enhance insulin sensitivity, weight management, reduces inflammation and has a positive effect on our mood and sleep," states &lt;a href="https://doctors.hackensackmeridianhealth.org/provider/saleem-husain/1316861" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Saleem Husain, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Saleem Husain, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an interventional cardiologist at JFK University Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/popular-nighttime-habit-that-spikes-blood-pressure" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:This Popular Nighttime Habit Could Spike Your Blood Pressure, Cardiologists Warn;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;This Popular Nighttime Habit Could Spike Your Blood Pressure, Cardiologists Warn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tips for Strength Training for a Stronger Heart Health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are tons of advice and workout plans available online, which are handy when starting a workout regimen. However, Dr. Mintz stresses that people looking to start strength training for a stronger heart should remember to "make it fun." Customization is also key based on your goals and experience. Here's what cardiologists recommend if you're trying to ramp up your strength training efforts for heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Know what qualifies as strength training&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert: It doesn't require a gym membership (but you might benefit from one if you like to use equipment that you don't have at home).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anything that increases muscle activity above normal activity [qualifies as strength training]," Dr. Mintz explains. "This can include weights and resistance bands."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Husain notes that body weight moves also count—think push-ups, crunches, and squats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Work different muscle groups&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiologists advise people to engage all their muscle groups each week. You might work the upper body, core, and lower body on separate days or opt for a full-body session three times a week. It is a personal choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One method is to break up exercise into body sections," Dr. Sathyamoorthy says. "The other is to do circuit training, where you use machines to work each part of the body, repeating each full round two to three times for a good workout."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sathyamoorthy adds that a bodyweight circuit approach, incorporating exercises such as push-ups, leg lifts, and squats, also works. "It's up to you, your goals and your comfort level," he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Understand how long to strength train for heart health&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association makes specific recommendations for duration and intensity of aerobic exercise, but doesn't do the same for resistance efforts. Dr. Rinde-Hoffman says there's not a cookie-cutter answer to questions like, "How long should I strength train for my heart?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It might look different for individuals depending on their age, sex, degree of physical conditioning and underlying medical conditions," Dr. Rinde-Hoffman points out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Husain recommends tacking on 15 to 20 minutes of strength training to cardio workouts two to three times each week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;4. Go slow&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cardiologists recommend easing into resistance training if you're a beginner or if it's been a while. "I usually recommend training with low-level weights, which you can use without having to hold your breath," Dr. Husain says, who adds it's important to warm up and cool down.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ensure you can keep your posture throughout the set. "Correct form is key to avoiding injury," Dr. Mintz advises. "Do not jerk the weights." He adds that a personal trainer can help ensure you keep good form, and he suggests gradually increasing weight as your body can tolerate it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/first-moves-trainers-teach-clients-for-stronger-core" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The First 2 Moves Trainers Teach Clients Who Want a Stronger Core;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The First 2 Moves Trainers Teach Clients Who Want a Stronger Core&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other Advice&lt;/strong&gt; for a Stronger Heart&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rinde-Hoffman emphasizes working every avenue you can to keep your heart as healthy as possible. She suggests:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="caas-list caas-list-bullet"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Managing underlying conditions, including high cholesterol and blood pressure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting enough sleep&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding other cardiovascular risk factors, like family history&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting regular aerobic exercise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting enough sleep&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prioritizing interpersonal connections&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprised to see the last one about connection there? "Prioritizing interpersonal connections with others is also helpful in promoting good heart health by reducing stress, promoting healthier lifestyle choices and improving overall mental health," she reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mintz's key takeaway about heart health and lifestyle habits takes a similar route.

&lt;p&gt;Hibernating mammals rely on particular genes to adjust their metabolisms as they enter that unique, low-energy state — and humans actually carry that same hibernation-related DNA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, early research hints that leveraging this particular DNA could help treat medical conditions in people, scientists say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hibernation offers "a whole bunch of different biometrically important superpowers," senior study author&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medicine.utah.edu/faculty/christopher-t-gregg" target="_blank" data-url="https://medicine.utah.edu/faculty/christopher-t-gregg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Christopher Gregg&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a human genetics professor at the University of Utah, told Live Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, ground squirrels can develop reversible &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/34757-insulin-resistance-develop-diabetes-heart-disease.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/34757-insulin-resistance-develop-diabetes-heart-disease.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;insulin resistance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that helps them rapidly gain weight before they hibernate but starts fading as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3854349/#sec1" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3854349/#sec1" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hibernation gets underway&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A better understanding of how hibernators flip this switch could be useful for tackling the insulin resistance that characterizes &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/40894-type-2-diabetes.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/40894-type-2-diabetes.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Gregg suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hibernating animals also protect their nervous systems from damage that could be caused by sudden changes in blood flow. "When they come out of hibernation, their brain is reperfused with blood," Gregg said. "Often that would cause a lot of damage, like a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/what-are-the-signs-of-stroke" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/what-are-the-signs-of-stroke"&gt;&lt;u&gt;stroke&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but they've developed ways to prevent that damage from happening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg and his colleagues think tapping into hibernation-related genes in people could unlock similar benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/best-ever-map-of-the-human-genome-sheds-light-on-jumping-genes-junk-dna-and-more" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/genetics/best-ever-map-of-the-human-genome-sheds-light-on-jumping-genes-junk-dna-and-more"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best-ever map of the human genome sheds light on 'jumping genes,' 'junk DNA' and more&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-7AZkmdVBg48FvFTEd52Fy3" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-7AZkmdVBg48FvFTEd52Fy3 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id="a-hub-of-hibernation-genes-3"&gt;A 'hub' of hibernation genes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a pair of studies published Thursday (July 31) in the journal Science, Gregg and his team pinpointed key levers that control genes related to hibernation, showing how they &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp4025" target="_blank" data-url="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp4025" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;differ between animals that hibernate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and those that don't. Then, in the lab experiments, they delved into the effects of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp4701" data-url="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adp4701" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;deleting these levers in lab mice&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although mice don't &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/54982-why-do-animals-hibernate.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/54982-why-do-animals-hibernate.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hibernate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they can enter torpor — a lethargic state of decreased metabolism, movement and body temperature that typically lasts for less than a day — after fasting for at least six hours. This made mice a suitable genetic model for studying these effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the gene-editing technique&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/58790-crispr-explained.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/58790-crispr-explained.html"&gt; &lt;u&gt;CRISPR&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists engineered mice with one of five conserved noncoding cis elements (CREs) deactivated, or "knocked out." These CREs act as levers to control genes that, in turn, code for proteins that carry out biological functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CREs targeted in the study lie near a gene cluster called the "fat mass and obesity-related locus," or the FTO locus, which is also found in humans. Gene variants found within the cluster have been tied to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10404889/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10404889/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;an elevated risk of obesity and related conditions&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Broadly speaking, the FTO locus is known to be important for controlling metabolism, energy expenditure and body mass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By knocking out the CREs, the researchers were able to change the mice's weights, metabolic rates and foraging behaviors. Some deletions sped up or slowed down weight gain, others turned metabolic rate up or down, and some affected how quickly the mice's body temperatures recovered after torpor, the researchers said in a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1092569" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1092569" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding is "highly promising," particularly given the FTO locus plays a well-known role in human obesity, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uaf.edu/chem/files/kdrew/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.uaf.edu/chem/files/kdrew/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kelly Drew&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a specialist on hibernation biology at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, told Live Science in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knocking out one CRE — called E1 — in female mice caused them to gain more weight on a high-fat diet than did a comparison group with all of their DNA intact. Deleting a different CRE, called E3, changed the foraging behavior of both male and female mice, specifically changing how they searched for food hidden in an arena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This suggests that important differences in foraging and decision processes may exist between hibernators and non-hibernators and the elements we uncovered might be involved," Gregg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="unknowns-to-address-3"&gt;Unknowns to address&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study authors said their results could be relevant to humans, since the underlying genes don't differ much between mammals. "It's how [the mammals] turn those genes on and off at different times and then for different durations and in different combinations that shape different species," Gregg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, "it's definitely not as simple as introducing the same changes in human DNA," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://evogenomes.sites.ucsc.edu/people/lab-members/" target="_blank" data-url="https://evogenomes.sites.ucsc.edu/people/lab-members/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Joanna Kelley&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a professor who specialises in functional genomics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, told Live Science in an email. "Humans are not capable of fasting-induced torpor, which is the reason why mice are used in these studies," said Kelley, who was not involved in the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She suggested that future work include animals incapable of torpor, and focus on unpacking all the downstream effects of the deleted CREs. As is, the current study "definitely points the field in a new direction" in terms of how scientists understand the genetic controls driving changes in hibernators throughout the year, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drew also highlighted that torpor in mice is triggered by fasting, while true hibernation is triggered by hormonal and seasonal changes and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-a-circadian-rhythm" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/what-is-a-circadian-rhythm"&gt;&lt;u&gt;internal clocks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. So while the CREs and genes the study identified are likely critical parts of a metabolic "toolkit" that responds to fasting, they may not be a "master switch" that turns hibernation on or off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nevertheless, uncovering these fundamental mechanisms in a tractable model like the mouse is an invaluable stepping stone for future research," Drew said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregg emphasized that much remains unknown, including why the effects of some deletions differed in female mice versus male mice or how the changes in foraging behavior seen in mice might manifest in humans. The team also plans to research what would happen if they deleted more than one hibernation-linked CRE at a time in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Down the line, Gregg thinks it could be possible to tweak the activity of humans' "hibernation hub genes" with drugs. The idea would be that this approach could yield the benefits of that gene activity — like neuroprotection — without patients having to actually hibernate, he said.&lt;/p&gt;

It's one of the most common types of cancer worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Thanks to obesity and alcohol consumption, bowel cancer has become the primary cause of the rising death toll among young adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The colon and rectum are both parts of the large intestine, which is part of the digestive system. Colorectal cancer often begins as a growth called a polyp inside the colon or rectum. Most colorectal cancers are curable when localized to the bowel. However, recurrence following surgery is a major problem and is often the ultimate cause of death. Colorectal cancer can develop when cells in the colon or rectum change and no longer behave normally. These changes can lead to precancerous conditions, such as adenomas, or colorectal cancer itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common type of colorectal cancer is adenocarcinoma, which starts in the gland cells that line the colon or rectum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorectal cancer, the most common gastrointestinal cancer, disproportionately affects Black, Hispanic, Indigenous, and Asian populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, colon cancer impacts more than 100,000 Americans every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, healthcare providers are relentlessly trying to draw our attention to the kind of lifestyle—including dietary habits, workouts, and sleeping patterns—that could be our ally in order to prevent colon cancer, especially in young adults. In this fight to prevent this aggressive type of cancer, nature’s basket must be our go-to, instead of processed and ultra-processed foods. A US-based Gastroenterologist, Joseph Salhab, D.O., recently shared a list of nutrition-packed fruits and vegetables that have been shown to reduce colon cancer risk, per a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37213399/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published in the World Journal of Gastroenterology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fruits to reduce the risk of colon cancer (when and how to eat them)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Watermelon&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than just a summertime favorite, watermelon may offer real health benefits, including &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37213399/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;a 26% reduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; in colon cancer risk with regular consumption, according to recent findings. Gastroenterologists recommend the fruit for its high lycopene content, a powerful antioxidant believed to protect cells from damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Best time to eat:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mid‑morning or afternoon snack, to both hydrate and curb cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Spruce it up:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; As Dr. Salhab highlights, watermelon is also incredibly hydrating, which supports digestive health and promotes regular bowel movements. Try it in savory dishes like a Watermelon, Cucumber &amp;amp; Feta Salad, or enjoy its natural sweetness in a refreshing No-Churn Watermelon Ice Cream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Apples&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The saying "an apple a day keeps the doctor away" may hold more truth than expected. Rich in gut-friendly fiber, apples have been shown to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37213399/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;reduce colon cancer risk by 25%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; when consumed in higher amounts. They also contain polyphenols, which Dr. Salhab notes offer antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Best time to eat:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Raw as breakfast or after lunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Spruce it up:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apples are not only portable and satisfying on their own, but also versatile in meals, from salads and overnight oats to a classic snack with peanut butter for a fiber and protein-rich combo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Kiwi&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a potential to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37213399/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;lower colorectal cancer risk by 13%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, kiwi is another fruit that shines in both nutrition and taste. Dr. Salhab calls it an excellent source of fiber, helping to support digestion. It’s also loaded with vitamin C, which plays a role in immune function, heart health, and skin repair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Best time to eat:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; With breakfast or as part of fruit bowls to kickstart digestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Spruce it up:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; While kiwi adds brightness to fruit salads and yogurt bowls, it also pairs beautifully with savory fare, like in Easy Fish Tacos with Kiwi Salsa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Citrus fruits (oranges, grapefruit, lemons, limes)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including more citrus fruits in your diet, such as oranges, grapefruits, lemons, limes, and tangerines, may also contribute to lower colon cancer risk, with studies showing &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37213399/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;a 9% decrease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; linked to higher citrus intake. These fruits are loaded with vitamin C, which acts as an antioxidant to help neutralize free radicals and possibly minimize DNA damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="86"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Best time to eat:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fresh citrus juice or whole fruit in the morning or midday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="90"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Spruce it up:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citrus also provides flavonoids, a type of polyphenol that may slow aging, reduce inflammation, and support cancer prevention. Celebrate warm weather and gut health with a Citrus Salad with Pomegranate &amp;amp; Mint, or repurpose scraps into a zero-waste Orange Peel Smoothie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="93"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why fruits are a great ally in cancer prevention&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="95"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While dietary fiber and plant-based foods are known to reduce colorectal cancer risk, not all fruits are equal. A 2023 meta-analysis found protective associations specifically for citrus, apples, watermelon, and kiwi. Compared to a low intake:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="97"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Watermelon reduced risk by 26%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="99"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="100"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Apples by 25%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="102"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="103"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Kiwi by 13%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="105"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="106"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Citrus by 9%, with an optimal intake of around 120 g/day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="108"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="109"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it is important to note that while fruit can play a supportive role, no single food can prevent or cure cancer. An amalgamation of protective habits, like consuming a high-fiber, plant-rich diet, combined with exercise, well-managed weight, and minimal alcohol, is essential. High-fiber, plant-rich diets are associated with significantly lower colorectal cancer risk; every extra 10 grams of fiber daily may reduce risk by about 7%. Cutting processed and red meats, sugary drinks, ultraprocessed foods, and limiting alcohol is essential, increasing risk by up to 40% in some studies. Furthermore, maintaining a healthy weight and exercising regularly helps reduce inflammation and the risk of digestive cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="114"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2025 14:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>健康专家警告Benadryl可能没有想象的那么有用- NewsNation</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidkFVX3lxTE1sTFNXejlXTXkydTZLVkI3ekRJdHk3b1NZZHFYMzVkSURNYndTbUMzZG5POFEyNnYzNGw1aTlyNEQ0Mk9EX25kSXoyOUJHVktSSFBXaW9sS2JYbGduUUM2MFhlX2g3M0pCd3RwbUhhU2dJZGg3OVHSAXtBVV95cUxNakY3NmJBeGNIY2FaQ0xSbU9Yc0pHMW5fb1E3OHFac05LSDRFUEFhQlpPWlpWTEd1b0VneE1wZy1PTGdvcDZaNHlVblBtam01ZzYyemI5LU9relF1RFVOaU45WkV5TmlZUXplLUxicS11MjdXTEltVWNveXM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

He’d tried steroid injections and PRP (platelet-rich plasma) injections, which Mehta said eventually did the trick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RCRPEWANCRCSJLCTS2V7RNEGYE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But when his right Achilles started hurting three months later, he opted for a different approach. He had recently started offering low-dose radiation therapy to treat some patients suffering from inflammatory conditions and thought: Why not try it himself? After six self-administered low-dose X-rays, covered by insurance, he found he was pain-free — and he began offering the therapy to more patients with similar noncancerous conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JIJKXU6OZBH2XBNBFAPMOCHNJQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The main surprise was … why didn’t I think of this earlier?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JUOZQZY6HZFKHD3NYETA4YZZSM" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Mehta is part of a growing trend among U.S. radiation specialists, who have begun offering low-dose X-ray therapy for benign conditions such as arthritis, &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/plantar-fasciitis" target="_blank"&gt;plantar fasciitis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peyronies-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353468" target="_blank"&gt;Peyronie’s disease&lt;/a&gt; and thick raised scars, or keloids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="65GZA3D23BEWXPCC5SLKJPXKUY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;After the American Society for Radiation Oncology discussed the use of low-dose radiation therapy for nonmalignant conditions in its spring 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.astro.org/getmedia/cdbdf346-2401-4dfc-9af1-2394e3562f59/2024-ASTROnews-Spring-(Digital).pdf" target="_blank"&gt;quarterly newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, its use began to pick up steam, Mehta said. Unlike radiation therapy for cancer, LDRT, as its name suggests, uses low doses to suppress inflammatory cells. Mehta said six LDRT treatments expose the patient to about the same amount of radiation as in one cancer treatment or what someone might get from “a few” CT scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="KTQCA6QS4ZEIBNG5WKFHE2A7PU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Low-dose radiation treatments almost &lt;a href="https://www.redjournal.org/article/S0360-3016%2822%2900357-1/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;date back&lt;/a&gt; to when X-rays were first discovered in 1895, Mehta said. They eventually fell out of favor in part due to new treatment options, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but also because of radiation fears, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="MKC7NFUTO5DTROSKDXGFMSFHXQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://virginiaradiation.com/our-team/gopal-k-bajaj-md-mba-fastro/" target="_blank"&gt;Gopal Bajaj&lt;/a&gt;, the musculoskeletal lead for the American Society for Radiation Oncology task force on non-oncologic disease, said LDRT remained popular in Europe. &lt;a href="https://www.degro.org/" target="_blank"&gt;The German Society for Radiation Oncology&lt;/a&gt; published &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10803052/" target="_blank"&gt;national guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for its use in nonmalignant diseases in 2000. In the United States, “it’s within the last decade or so that there’s been a slow reemergence of interest into exploring radiotherapy for conditions other than cancer,” Bajaj said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NJXU6LDBP5FZVI54TJB3VAWDF4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Bajaj first encountered it as a therapy about a decade ago when an interested patient with &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/dupuytrens-contracture#:~:text=Dupuytren%20contracture%20is%20an%20abnormal,cases%2C%20both%20hands%20are%20affected." target="_blank"&gt;Dupuytren’s contracture&lt;/a&gt; — a condition that involves thickening of the skin on the palm of the hand, often causing fingers to curl under — asked for it. He started delving into the scientific literature, which was primarily German, and decided it was worth a try. It worked, halting the progression of her condition, which Bajaj said is the goal of the treatment. Since then, Bajaj has seen around 800 people with the disease who fly in from all over the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SOH5PYRLZJAPBOUD2IMSYQ4GHU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Most patients we see with Dupuytren’s are actively progressing when they begin treatment, and after radiation therapy, fewer than 5 to 8 percent continue to worsen,” Bajaj said. When it comes to inflammatory conditions like osteoarthritis, tendinopathy or plantar fasciitis, Bajaj said, 60 to 80 percent of his patients report some symptom improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JJI7TJZN7BEGTNQF73PJXOOVYU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A Department of Veterans Affairs survey last year of &lt;a href="https://www.hsrd.research.va.gov/publications/esp/Radiation-Benign-Conditions.cfm" target="_blank"&gt;48 studies&lt;/a&gt; on the effectiveness of LDRT for a variety of conditions, some several decades old, found mixed evidence to make conclusions about its effectiveness, but it said there was no reason not to try it “after conventional therapy fails.” Bajaj and Mehta said they believe the research is still catching up to what doctors are seeing in the clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="DDRUVSQS2RHPTHNIO7G6JQ6KLM" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="DDRUVSQS2RHPTHNIO7G6JQ6KLM" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6DQYZRC3MJFO3FOMZ7VNPONM74" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Whenever there’s trauma (from a surgery or an injury), macrophages, white blood cells that modulate inflammation, begin to secrete chemicals that promote inflammation. The X-rays suppress the macrophages, which “stops this inflammatory cascade from taking hold and, therefore, the pain and the swelling goes away,” Mehta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2WZPGOHKJ5A5LORUQ2C3TSERGY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;LDRT can work for injuries or conditions where there’s inflammation, Mehta said, such as tendinitis, osteoarthritis and plantar fasciitis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="7SODFR2XBJBMFG4DOFHXSGT2KY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In some cases, LDRT seems to provide immediate relief, while others can take longer. In Mehta’s case, it took six to eight weeks before his Achilles felt better. A cortisone shot may work faster, he said, but judging from his and his patients’ experiences, the LDRT results seem to last longer. He said it may also be more beneficial to the long-term health of the joints because cortisone shots can weaken the tendon and the fibers of the connective tissue, which can up the risk for tendon ruptures with repeated injections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="3HOQJPEUU5FINE4E5G5ORTV74M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There is a “sweet spot” for LDRT, Bajaj said. If a patient’s condition is too advanced, such as if their arthritis has led to a bone-on-bone (without cartilage or fluid to pad it) situation, or there’s an autoimmune component to it, such as with ankylosing spondylitis, it probably won’t work, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="2NO4MTWFXRDKHLVUW4GG4GVPHU" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="2NO4MTWFXRDKHLVUW4GG4GVPHU" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Downsides and risks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="U7FMCM5QFJEPXIT3MKO2KZISO4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Not all radiation specialists are on board with low-dose X-ray treatment for benign conditions. At Moffitt Cancer Center in Florida, for instance, when &lt;a href="https://www.moffitt.org/providers/jose-penagaricano/" target="_blank"&gt;Jose Penagaricano&lt;/a&gt;, a radiation oncologist who has been treating patients with malignant conditions for six years, started treating osteoarthritis and Dupuytren contracture about a year ago, he got some pushback from colleagues worried that LDRT would take machine time away from ill cancer patients, he said. By limiting consultations for LDRT cases, though, he said the impact has been minimal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XNGW3T4KYNF63I2FU7VJ4ZWHTA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;The bigger concern that those using LDRT have heard from colleagues and patients is radiation exposure. Even low-dose exposure over a lifetime has the potential to cause a small increase in the risk of cancer, &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/radiation/radiation-health-effects#:~:text=These%20studies%20show%20that%20radiation,dose%2C%20the%20lower%20the%20risk." target="_blank"&gt;according to&lt;/a&gt; the Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="TCNHBZGRJZBXJGRWW4XUJDUSQE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;David Brenner, director of the &lt;a href="https://www.crr.columbia.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Center for Radiological Research&lt;/a&gt; at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, said that, in general, the long-term health concerns related to radiation exposure are specific to organs that “have a lot of dividing cells,” such as the gastrointestinal system. Hands, feet and knees — frequent sites for LDRT — would be of less concern, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6QAAY4MN45CYDERN7YZL6J4GJ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;A 2015 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4984935/#:~:text=Overall%2C%20the%20evidence%20suggests%20that%20the%20risks,is%20being%20considered%20in%20adolescents%20or%20children" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in the British Journal of Radiology suggests that the risks of cancer following low-dose radiation therapy for benign disease tend to be small, especially in older patients. But because “exposure to radiation has the potential to cause a radiation-induced cancer many years after treatment,” it may be an issue for younger adults, adolescents and children, the study said. Concerns about lifetime accumulation of radiation is why radiation doctors typically use this treatment only on patients over 40, Mehta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="54BQCSA66REY3PU5UM3O6ICLQU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“The major thing people are worried about with radiation is radiation itself causing cancer, [but] it takes, even in higher-dose cancer patients, literally decades for a second cancer to develop,” he said. “With these low doses of radiation that we use for arthritis and tendinitis, there’s been nothing described in the literature for over a hundred years.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2025 13:31:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxNQmFWUDQ1QnhoTkpJd2lzRUpNSExTY1dROS05UktZeXp0WVFOYU1IUjBtaVZCWk0zaDNzTkdjM1c4M3Z3LUJSRmxzXzNuRU9xemQ4T3NIdVBTcXlMel92UGJMVGxFS0FJV3l6d1phdEdtcTFkNlRwcFd6cGZFeE1jR0RPbHBsUFY3aGgzcVl1ZTRrNGk2TEE</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法， 50岁后减肥的5个习惯- EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxPbkVHT1FEeDZDbUpnM0I0NkZ4VmpmQnB1cjJjYWliV0lsd3E1clpRVXViMmNYYjhxd0JQWWFqbWM1NURLd2FVOGVfNjlyTFpKSXFxT0ZGQk9qZktldEFPWi1DVHRUVWtNa0xwYmVIOVAzX2JvSDkyb2pXOEhaQUJGdnJuWEQ1bDg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;After 50, our metabolisms naturally slow down, which can lead to weight gain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This may be compounded by hormonal changes, difficulty sleeping and new medications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RDs say the trick to weight loss after 50 is replacing old habits with newer, more effective ones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Weight loss can feel like an uphill battle at any age. But if you’re over 50, you may have noticed it’s become a bit trickier. And it’s not just your imagination. "As we age, muscle mass naturally declines, which lowers your resting metabolic rate, meaning your body burns fewer calories at rest,” says &lt;a href="http://jamieleerdn.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Jamie Lee McIntyre, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, that’s not the only reason it’s harder to shed pounds after 50. Hormonal shifts, difficulty sleeping and new medications can also make weight loss more challenging.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Beyond the changes that come with aging, some &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/275602/10-unhealthy-habits-you-need-to-break-now/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;everyday habits&lt;/a&gt; could quietly be making the process even harder.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re all about cardio but rarely hit the weights, you’re missing out on a critical component of weight loss, especially later in life. “Prioritizing strength training can help preserve muscle, boost metabolism and support sustainable weight management after 50,” says &lt;a href="https://whitnessnutrition.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Whitney Stuart, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. Why? Muscle is a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290619/trying-to-lose-weight-heres-why-strength-training-is-as-important-as-cardio/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;calorie-burning machine&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, as we age, muscle mass naturally declines. So, if you’re not actively working to rebuild or maintain it, your metabolism can slow down.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Strength training helps combat this by building muscle, which helps you burn more calories even when you’re not exercising.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, studies show that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7949443/best-strength-training-exercises/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;resistance exercises&lt;/a&gt; like lifting weights or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/7-day-body-weight-training-plan-for-beginners-11744140" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;bodyweight activities&lt;/a&gt; can help preserve and even increase muscle mass as we age, laying the foundation for a leaner and healthier body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unfortunately, many of us may shy away from strength training, either out of fear of injury or simply because we haven’t heard how important it is. Or maybe you think you need a gym membership or just don’t know where to get started. No problem, says &lt;a href="http://nutritionstarringyou.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lauren Harris-Pincus, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “Simple body work like push ups, planks and squats are easily done at home with no equipment and will help to strengthen large muscle groups as well as build core strength,” she says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-following-fad-diets"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Following Fad Diets  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fad diets often promise quick results. Yet, they rarely provide the sustainable solutions necessary for managing weight. While that can be an issue at any age, it can be especially problematic after 50 for several reasons. For starters, many trendy diets are restrictive, often cutting out entire food groups or dramatically reducing calories. While you may see the numbers on the scale dip temporarily, this approach can backfire by slowing your metabolism even further. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To complicate matters, many calorie-cutting diets are also low in protein. “Eating a low-protein, low-calorie diet specifically can backfire by further reducing muscle mass and slowing metabolism even more,” says Stuart. “Without enough protein, the body may break down muscle for energy, which makes it harder to maintain a healthy weight long term.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As tempting as it may seem to jump on the latest weight loss craze, skip it. You’ll have far greater success with a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2053490/high-protein-flat-belly-diet-meal-plan/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;balanced eating plan&lt;/a&gt; that includes plenty of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-proteins-to-help-you-lose-weight-11770165" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lean protein&lt;/a&gt;, fruits, vegetables and healthy fats. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-neglecting-sleep"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Neglecting Sleep  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Sleep is often overlooked when it comes to weight loss, but &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-if-you-dont-get-enough-sleep-11746534" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;poor sleep&lt;/a&gt; can silently hinder your efforts. The reason? After 50, sleep patterns can naturally become more erratic due to lifestyle changes, stress or hormonal shifts.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That doesn’t just cause sleepless nights and daytime drowsiness. Sleep deprivation also disrupts &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7917054/what-happen-to-your-hormones-when-you-lose-weight-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;hunger-regulating hormones&lt;/a&gt; like leptin and ghrelin. This imbalance can lead to increased cravings, particularly for high-calorie foods. That’s not all. Research has also found that people who don’t get enough sleep tend to consume fewer fruits and vegetables, yet eat more fast food, fat and sugar, making them even more likely to gain weight.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It can be helpful to know that some age-related changes in sleep patterns are normal, such as going to sleep earlier at night and waking up earlier in the morning. However, sleep shouldn’t become so elusive that you can’t regularly get the seven to nine hours your body needs. If you’re having difficulty getting enough sleep, talk to your health care provider, who can help you determine the reason and find strategies to help you get the rest you need.

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-sticking-with-the-same-eating-habits"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Sticking with the Same Eating Habits &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With age, our energy needs naturally begin to decline. So, if you’re eating the same way you always have, you might start to gain weight, even if the foods you eat are healthy.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Maybe you’ve always finished what’s on your plate or snacked while watching TV. While that might have worked just fine in the past, after age 50, these habits can start to work against you. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Mindless snacking, especially in the evening, can sabotage weight loss efforts,” says &lt;a href="http://drlisayoung.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lisa R. Young, Ph.D., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “Many people eat out of boredom or habit while watching TV, often choosing calorie-dense foods without realizing how much they’re consuming. These extra, unaccounted-for calories can add up quickly.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If that sounds familiar, take time to sit down at the table to eat without distractions. This will help you focus on enjoying your food and pay attention to your body’s hunger and fullness signals, which may help you eat less. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-forgetting-to-drink-up"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Forgetting to Drink Up  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Hydration plays a key role in digestion, metabolism and overall satiety. Yet, as you age, your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8064290/how-to-tell-if-you-are-dehydrated/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sense of thirst diminishes&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, many older people don’t drink nearly enough fluids.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This can make it harder to meet your hydration needs without conscious effort and may even lead to dehydration. In addition, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8023931/does-dehydration-cause-weight-gain/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;dehydration can mimic hunger&lt;/a&gt;, prompting you to eat more at meals or snack more frequently.  Because dehydration can also slow your body’s metabolic processes, it can make it harder to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/290811/can-losing-weight-slow-your-metabolism/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;burn calories efficiently&lt;/a&gt;. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The fix? Aim for at least eight glasses of water a day. For even better weight loss results, try to drink a big glass of water before meals. This simple, effective strategy may help you feel full faster and prevent overeating.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Losing weight after 50 can seem tricky, but it doesn’t have to be. The key lies in identifying old habits that work against your goals and replacing them with newer, more effective ones that work for your body today. By incorporating habits like regular strength training, eating a balanced diet, prioritizing sleep, being mindful of portion sizes and drinking enough fluids, you can overcome many of the weight loss challenges that naturally come with aging. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If that sounds like a lot, remember, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-i-lost-110-pounds-8773037" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;small, sustainable changes&lt;/a&gt; build up over time. Stay patient and be kind to yourself through the process. And, most importantly, focus on feeling strong, healthy and energetic. Because being your healthiest, best self isn’t just about the number on the scale.&lt;br&gt;

He had enjoyed hiking, running the St. George Marathon — he ran it 25 years in a row — traveling the world with his wife, Mindy, climbing mountains, just living an active lifestyle. From what he knew at the time, he could never do these things again with Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As time went on, the 67-year-old Logan resident began to deteriorate. The tremors and rigidity transformed the man who ran ultramarathons into one who could barely walk across his living room without holding on to something. And when his &lt;a href="https://www.webbmortuary.com/obituaries/mindy-lundgreen" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;wife died from ovarian cancer&lt;/a&gt; in 2024, Lundgreen wondered how he'd even go on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then he figured it out: He'd try to move his body the way he used to on adventures with Mindy. And like his late wife, he would encourage other people to move, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When I heard the doctor, I thought, oh, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; Parkinson's," he said. "But just moving has made me feel better, and inspiring other people to move has made this whole diagnosis into a gift. I want to live until I'm 90 years old! And I have the special formula to make that happen: move."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lundgreen discovered it is one thing to want to move and a whole other thing to actually do it, but a recent trip to the Grand Tetons opened his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I went to visit him — I hadn't seen him in a while — and I saw him and thought: Wow. He was having a hard time walking across a room," said David Toone, Lundgreen's friend and "soul brother," who is 68. "So, I said to him, 'Do you want to come climb Middle Teton?' And he actually showed up to do it. That really opened my eyes. He was still frail, but he was going to give it a go."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lundgreen had to accept that walking around the block or across a parking lot was going to be harder than he thought possible. He also had to accept that he would not walk or run as fast as he had before. He still had Parkinson's, meaning he would be in pain when he moved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a challenging climb for Lundgreen, as well as for Toone and others on the trip. They helped Lundgreen up and down the climbing paths, which added to their hiking time and difficulty level, but Toone said getting his longtime friend moving again was worth the time it took to complete the climb.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Lundgreen remembered what it was like when he began running marathons and hiking decades before — once he started, he felt better and couldn't stop. He also couldn't stop talking to people about the importance of moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;I feel better now than when I was diagnosed.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;–Kim Lundgreen, who has Parkinson's disease&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He attended a boxing class in Logan and encouraged people to take the stairs instead of using the elevator. Lundgreen registered for a 5K race and, later, a trail marathon, hoping others could see how important movement is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lundgreen is not one to preach on social media, but he does like to spread his movement message through a conversation, because a conversation allows people to ask questions and share new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His message is clear: You don't have to run marathons — but you can do something. And once you start doing something, that's when you start to dream of a happy future with Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The changes in his life and his return to physical activity have brought attention from people all over the world. A Parkinson's patient in Australia contacted him to discuss how he returned to running. Many others from across the globe have asked the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the big surprise was when &lt;a href="https://ultramarathonman.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Dean Karnazes&lt;/a&gt;, an American ultramarathon runner, contacted him to offer his support and to wish him well on his continued running journey. Karnazes, who is famous for running 50 marathons in the 50 states in 50 days, as well as running 148 miles on a treadmill in 24 hours, suggested that the two of them go for a run together the next time Karnazes is in Utah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this attention — even from someone as massive to a runner as Karnazes — has not swayed Lundgreen from his goals. His biggest bucket-list item is to climb Mount Kilimanjaro, and he plans to return to Salzburg, Austria, where he and his late wife once took a "Sound of Music" tour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, Lundgreen hopes to be alive to see what science will come up with for people with &lt;a href="https://healthcare.utah.edu/healthfeed/2024/09/parkinsons-disease-understanding-complex-neurodegenerative-disorder" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Parkinson's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to be alive when they come up with a cure for Parkinson's," he said. "I'm telling you, I feel better now than when I was diagnosed. The 5K race was like breaking through a brick wall. As long as I'm moving, I feel great."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coffee may reduce the absorption of iron, calcium, magnesium and some vitamins.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wait at least 1 hour after coffee to take supplements for better nutrient uptake.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not everyone needs supplements—talk to your provider before adding them to your routine.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re the kind of person who can’t start their day without a cup (or two) of coffee, you’re not alone. Coffee is a staple morning ritual—whether it’s sipped alongside breakfast, before a workout or first thing after waking up, that morning brew helps us feel energized and ready for the day. But if you also take vitamins or minerals as part of your morning routine, it’s worth knowing how coffee might influence how your body absorbs those nutrients.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Caffeine, polyphenols and &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/is-coffee-dehydrating-8781369" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;coffee’s mild diuretic effect&lt;/a&gt; can interfere with how your body uses certain vitamins and minerals. "For instance, iron absorption can be slowed by caffeine and caffeine can impact certain nutrients via its diuretic properties," says Philip Ngo, Pharm.D. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We spoke with pharmacists to understand how coffee can impact nutrient absorption—and what you can do to get the most from your supplements.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-iron"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Iron  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/health-benefits-of-iron-8733430" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Iron&lt;/a&gt; is essential for growth, hormone production and cellular function. And it’s a common nutrient deficiency, so your healthcare provider may have suggested supplementing.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "Having coffee with an iron supplement or fortified cereal may make your body absorb less iron," notes Bo Wang, M.D., Pharm.D. "Over time, a heavy caffeine habit could potentially impact bone and mineral health." One study found that drinking coffee with iron reduced absorption by 54%. Pairing it with breakfast further lowered absorption.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This interaction isn’t about the caffeine—it’s due to chlorogenic acid, a polyphenol in coffee and tea. "This compound is a strong inhibitor of non-heme iron absorption (the type found in plant foods and supplements)," adds Elise Kim, Pharm.D., BCACP, CDCES, AHSCP-CHC. Researchers believe that the polyphenols may impact the way our gut absorbs iron. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Wang recommends separating iron from coffee by at least one hour and pairing it with &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2052728/6-foods-with-more-vitamin-c-than-an-orange/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin C-rich foods&lt;/a&gt;, such as lemons and oranges, to enhance absorption.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-vitamin-d"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Vitamin D &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8034163/benefits-vitamin-d/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt; is a nutrient that is hard to get through diet alone, since it’s not naturally found in many foods. However, our bodies can also make vitamin D from sunshine.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;"Research suggests that caffeine may reduce the expression of vitamin D receptors, which can lower vitamin D levels," says Kim. "However, its clinical impact is still being studied." A 2021 study linked higher caffeine intake with lower circulating levels of vitamin D, though more research is needed.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To get the most from your supplement, consider spacing it at least an hour away from your coffee, Ngo suggests. And since vitamin D is fat-soluble, taking it with a meal that includes healthy fats can help improve absorption.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-b-vitamins"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. B Vitamins  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-vitamin-b-complex-8669791" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;group of water-soluble vitamins&lt;/a&gt;—including B1, B2, B7, B9 and B12—supports energy production, nerve function and red blood cell formation. Water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water, and our bodies cannot store a lot of excess at one time.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "As B vitamins are water-soluble, caffeine’s mild diuretic effect can increase how much your body excretes, especially with higher caffeine intake," says Kim. Studies show that people who drink coffee tend to have lower levels of circulating B vitamins, likely due to urinary losses.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Avoid taking supplements with coffee or tea," advises Wang. "Wait an hour if you can. Water-soluble vitamins (C, Bs) are fine with or without food, but may go down easier after a meal."&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-benefits-8656021" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Magnesium&lt;/a&gt; is an important mineral that plays a role in protein synthesis, blood sugar management, blood pressure regulation and sleep quality.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;it’s found in foods like beans, nuts and yogurt, many people don’t get enough from diet alone.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; "Caffeine can increase calcium and magnesium loss through urine," notes Kim.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re taking magnesium as part of a nighttime routine—a common supplement to help you sleep better—it’s best to avoid caffeine close to bedtime. Not only can caffeine interfere with sleep, but it may also reduce magnesium’s effectiveness in promoting deeper rest.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just like magnesium, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/calcium-benefits-8649279" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;calcium&lt;/a&gt; may be impacted by coffee’s diuretic effects. "Calcium absorption may be reduced by caffeine, but the clinical impact remains unclear," says Kim. A study showed that participants who consumed caffeine had 77% more calcium excreted by their kidneys compared to a placebo group.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Adding milk to your coffee may help offset calcium loss, and spacing out calcium supplements at least one hour after your coffee—or two hours before—can help support better absorption, suggests Kim.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Coffee can influence how your body absorbs certain nutrients, but simple timing tweaks can help. Spacing out your supplements from coffee by an hour can support better absorption. If you occasionally forget and take them together, you’ll still likely absorb some nutrients.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And in spite of what you may see being pushed by wellness influencers, not everyone needs supplements. "Supplements are just that—to supplement," says Ngo. "For a person in good general health who consumes a balanced diet, it may not be worth investing in supplements unless you are truly deficient." Chatting with a health care provider and lab testing can help determine what’s best for you.&lt;br&gt;

The study found that men were more likely to empathize with their partner, identify the situation as discriminatory, and express greater overall awareness of sexism and commitment to gender equality when they actively took their partner’s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, led by Emily J. Cross of York University in Canada, sheds light on how romantic relationships might serve as a unique environment for fostering men’s awareness of gender discrimination. While traditional efforts to reduce sexism often fall short, especially when targeting men, this study suggests that hearing directly from a romantic partner about sexism may be a promising avenue for increasing understanding and reducing gender-biased attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were interested in whether romantic relationships could serve as a meaningful context for raising men’s awareness of sexism. Research shows that men, on average, are less likely than women to &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1111/josi.12083" target="_blank"&gt;recognize gender discrimination&lt;/a&gt; or understand its impact—perhaps because conversations about sexism can feel accusatory, prompting defensiveness or disengagement,” explained Cross, a senior research associate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At the same time, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/spc3.12116" target="_blank"&gt;perspective-taking&lt;/a&gt;—imagining how an experience might feel from someone else’s point of view—has been shown to reduce intergroup prejudice and discrimination. We figured romantic relationships might offer a unique opportunity: partners are often attuned to each other’s emotions, and what affects one usually matters to the other.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That kind of closeness could give men a powerful reason to better understand what their partner is going through. So we asked: could that intimacy motivate men to take their partner’s perspective—and in doing so, help them recognize sexism not as isolated moments, but as part of a broader pattern of gender-based inequality?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this, the researchers conducted two studies with heterosexual men who had been in romantic relationships with women for at least a year. In the first study, 576 participants recruited online were randomly assigned to read a scenario about gender discrimination in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman in the scenario was described as either the man’s romantic partner, a close friend, or a stranger. All participants read that the woman had learned that a male colleague with similar qualifications was earning 25% more than her. She suspected the pay gap was due to her being a woman and expressed frustration and uncertainty about what to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After reading the scenario, participants were asked how much they could put themselves in the woman’s shoes, how sexist they perceived the situation to be, and how aware they were of sexism more generally. They also completed surveys measuring their broader attitudes about gender, including modern sexist beliefs (such as denying that sexism still exists) and protective paternalism (the belief that men should shield and provide for women).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that men were more likely to engage in perspective-taking when the woman in the scenario was described as their romantic partner. Men in this condition also rated the situation as more sexist compared to those who read about a friend or a stranger. These effects remained even when accounting for participants’ general levels of empathy, relationship quality, and existing sexist beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, simply imagining a partner experiencing sexism did not directly lead to broader changes in gender attitudes or increased awareness of discrimination against women in general. But when researchers analyzed indirect pathways, they found that perspective-taking increased the likelihood of perceiving the situation as sexist, which in turn predicted greater general awareness and lower modern sexism scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second study was designed to test whether similar patterns emerged when men recalled real experiences with their partners rather than imagined scenarios. The researchers surveyed 570 men, of whom 432 reported that their romantic partner had previously shared a personal experience of gender discrimination. These included examples like being passed over for a promotion, receiving unwanted sexual attention, or hearing sexist jokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were asked to describe the incident and then answer questions about how much they took their partner’s perspective, whether they viewed the situation as discriminatory, and how aware they were of sexism in society. They also answered questions about how often they believed their partner experienced discrimination and whether they had taken actions to support gender equality—such as learning more about women’s issues or confronting sexism when they witnessed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As predicted, men who reported greater perspective-taking during their partner’s disclosure were more likely to view the situation as sexist. This recognition was, in turn, associated with greater awareness of how often women—and their partner specifically—experience discrimination. It also predicted higher levels of allyship behaviors, including a stronger commitment to confronting gender bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, these effects held even when controlling for participants’ existing beliefs about gender roles and other factors. This suggests that the relational context itself plays a powerful role in shaping how men respond to discussions about sexism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were struck by how consistent the perspective-taking effect was,” Cross told PsyPost. “These effects emerged regardless of how close men felt to their partner, how satisfied they were in the relationship, or their pre-existing views on gender equality. What really made the difference was the act of taking their partner’s perspective—actively imagining how the situation felt for her when she described an experience of sexism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight how romantic relationships can create opportunities for men to become more aware of sexism by prompting them to empathize with someone they care deeply about. When men are personally connected to someone affected by discrimination, they may be more open to recognizing it and questioning their own assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Men were more likely to recognize sexism when it affected their women romantic partner (vs woman friend or stranger),” Cross said. “This recognition also spilled over to their broader beliefs — men were more aware of gender discrimination in general and were less likely to agree with subtle, everyday beliefs that downplay or dismiss sexism.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the study, like all research, includes some caveats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our studies specifically focused on man–woman relationships, so we didn’t test whether the same dynamics would apply in other types of relationships,” Cross noted. “And while perspective-taking can be a powerful tool for building awareness, it’s not enough on its own—lasting progress requires systemic changes and collective efforts to challenge gender inequality.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest future studies could examine how similar dynamics play out in other close relationships, such as between siblings or parents and children, and whether interventions like high-quality listening training might help men better engage with stories of discrimination. Longitudinal research could also help clarify whether perspective-taking leads to increased awareness over time, or whether more awareness makes men more likely to empathize in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re interested in exploring how men respond to a broader range of disclosures from women—ranging from subtle forms of sexism to more overt discrimination—and what kinds of partner responses women actually want and find supportive,” Cross said. “We’re also studying how these conversations play out in real time, including what fosters meaningful engagement versus what triggers defensiveness or withdrawal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One key takeaway is that man–woman romantic relationships can provide a powerful context for raising men’s awareness of sexism and gender discrimination,” she added. “When men are willing to listen and genuinely engage with their partner’s experiences, they may begin to see sexism not just as a distant or abstract issue, but as something that affects the women they care about—and recognize it as part of a broader, structural problem that demands attention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/19485506251345111" target="_blank"&gt;Leveraging Man−Woman Romantic Relationships to Promote Men’s Awareness of Sexism and Gender Discrimination&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Emily.

					&lt;p&gt;Belly fat always seems to creep up when you least expect it to. As you age, experiencing a redistribution in &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/simple-daily-exercises-belly-fat/" target="_blank"&gt;body fat&lt;/a&gt; is quite common. Where does it tend to gravitate? The abdomen. Hormonal shifts and the natural loss of &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/bodyweight-exercises-build-muscle-after-45/" target="_blank"&gt;lean muscle&lt;/a&gt; are partly to blame. But there are several things you can do to take charge of your health and &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/bodyweight-moves-belly-fat-after-40/" target="_blank"&gt;reclaim your waistline&lt;/a&gt;. First off, if you’ve only been doing cardio, it’s time to tweak your workout regimen. We spoke with a trainer who shares five bodyweight &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.eatthis.com/core-strengthening-exercises/" target="_blank"&gt;core exercises&lt;/a&gt; that burn belly fat faster than cardio after 40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s important to remember that you can’t spot-reduce fat. What you &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; do is build lean muscle, which &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://thebracelife.com/bookings-old/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Robert Brace&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, celebrity trainer and founder of &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://bracelifestudios.com/about" target="_blank"&gt;Brace Life Studios&lt;/a&gt;, says is “your metabolism’s best friend.”&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;“Increasing your lean muscle mass will increase your metabolism, which is the process through which your body processes energy,” Robert explains. “Energy is often stored as fat in your body so increasing your lean muscle mass is a great way to burn body fat all over your body. Especially after 40, when hormonal shifts slow fat burning, building lean muscle whether it’s through weight training or bodyweight resistance can dramatically improve your body’s ability to burn fat even at rest. That’s been the key to many of our clients’ waistline transformations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, Robert shares five go-to bodyweight core exercises perfect for those 40+ who want to burn fat and sculpt strong abs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Begin standing tall, feet shoulder-width apart and hands by your chest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bend your knees as you lower into a squat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When rising up, drive your left knee up toward your chest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twist your torso toward your raised knee.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; We consulted with dietitians who shared valuable insights into &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7906041/things-you-should-do-before-8-am-according-to-a-dietitian/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;optimizing morning routines&lt;/a&gt; for brain health and practical tips to boot!

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Starting your day with a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7913071/high-protein-high-fiber-breakfast-recipes/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;nutrient-dense breakfast&lt;/a&gt; sets the tone for overall health, and eggs are a stand-out option. “Exciting new data suggests an association between &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7960178/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-eggs-every-day/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;eating eggs&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/mind-diet-dementia-study-11748383" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;reduced risk of Alzheimer’s dementia&lt;/a&gt; in older adults,” shares &lt;a href="https://minddietmeals.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="4" rel="nofollow"&gt;Maggie Moon, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Research has shown that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-with-more-vitamin-d-than-an-egg-8732396" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;nutrients in eggs&lt;/a&gt; like choline, the omega-3 fatty acid DHA, and lutein help support lifelong brain health,” adds Moon.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Moon adds that although choline is crucial for brain health, 90% of Americans don’t get enough of this nutrient.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Eating two eggs provides 50-70% of your daily choline requirement.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Working eggs into your morning is easy—enjoy them scrambled, boiled, or as part of an omelet packed with veggies.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-have-a-morning-cup-of-coffee"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Have a Morning Cup Of Coffee &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Yes, you read that right—your &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/women-aging-coffee-study-11748151" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;morning cup of joe&lt;/a&gt; may be doing more than waking you up. Research found that &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/this-surprising-drink-could-reduce-heart-disease-risk-11692285" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;moderate coffee consumption&lt;/a&gt;, around 1 to 4 cups a day, could help lower the risk of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; It turns out that coffee’s natural blend of antioxidants, along with the stimulating effects of caffeine, plays a role in &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-doctors-do-every-day-for-better-brain-health-11678638" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;supporting brain health&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What’s particularly exciting is how simple this habit is to adopt. Imagine starting your day with a comforting cup of coffee, knowing you’re not just fueling your morning but potentially protecting your brain for the long run. Experts emphasize that moderation is key, as excessive caffeine might have downsides. And make sure to limit (or even avoid) any added sugars when prepping your morning drink—excessive added sugar consumption can actually hurt, not help, your brain health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Giving your brain a “workout” is just as important as starting your day with physical movement. “Word games support cognitive function by stimulating recall, memory, language and problem-solving skills that support brain health,” explains &lt;a href="https://nutritiondigested.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Amy Brownstein, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Incorporate word games like crossword puzzles or spelling bees into your breakfast routine to help keep your mind sharp,” Brownstein advised.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Try setting aside just 10 or 15 minutes each morning to enjoy the crossword puzzle over your coffee or while eating breakfast. It’s a small commitment that could have long-term benefits. And if you’re looking for variety, you can swap out the crossword for Sudoku, word searches, or even a quick brain-training app. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-take-a-morning-walk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Take a Morning Walk  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Moving your body in the morning can work wonders for your brain. “Walking boosts blood flow to the brain, which helps deliver oxygen and nutrients that support brain health,” explained &lt;a href="https://nutritionwithjuliana.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Juliana Crimi, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://m.h.sc" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;M.H.Sc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://nutritionwithjuliana.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;., RD,&lt;/a&gt;. “Regular &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/exercise-every-day-study-11707905" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt;physical activity&lt;/a&gt; has been linked to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-for-better-memory-11781473" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="5"&gt;better memory&lt;/a&gt;,  thinking, and a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/dementia-risk-doubling-study-8776659" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="6"&gt;lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt; over time,” Crimi explains.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Bonus? Walking stimulates the release of endorphins, putting you in a positive mindset to face the day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Aim for at least 20 to 30 minutes each morning at a pace that feels comfortable for you. Whether you stroll through your neighborhood, a local park, or simply around your backyard, the combined effects of movement, fresh air, and sunlight &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291942/exactly-how-much-nature-time-you-need-to-reap-the-physical-and-mental-benefits/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;enhance both physical and mental health&lt;/a&gt;.

Regular meditation supports memory and focus by &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/things-to-do-when-you-wake-up-if-you-have-chronic-inflammation-8789044" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reducing stress and inflammation&lt;/a&gt;, two factors associated with cognitive decline.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Setting aside just 5 to 10 minutes in the morning to meditate creates a calming start to your day while enhancing your brain’s ability to manage emotional and cognitive tasks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can start with basic mindfulness meditation, focusing on your breath and letting go of distractions. Over time, you may find that taking even a small pause each morning helps you feel more grounded and promotes a lasting sense of mental clarity. Use a meditation app or simply create a quiet space in your home to integrate this powerful practice into your routine.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Social connections are key to longevity and brain health. Research consistently shows that maintaining an active social life can help stave off Alzheimer’s by keeping your brain engaged and reducing the risks associated with isolation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Starting your morning with a brief call or text to a close friend or family member can provide a small boost of happiness and connectedness.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These interactions don’t have to be lengthy! Just a friendly hello or check-in is enough to start your day on a positive note. If distance or busyness is a barrier, consider making it a weekly ritual with one or several loved ones. Sharing a laugh or a conversation can do wonders for your mental well-being, while also supporting healthy communication networks in your brain.

From the foods you eat to the activities you prioritize, the morning provides a unique opportunity to start your day with intention. Whether it’s enjoying eggs at breakfast, stimulating your brain with a puzzle, or recharging through a walk or meditation, these small steps add up over time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Experts agree that while no single habit can guarantee prevention, consistent efforts to incorporate healthy practices into your daily life can make a meaningful impact. The key is to find a routine that resonates with you; start small, stay consistent, and prioritize your health one morning at a time.&lt;br&gt;

Leaks are typically caused by injuries or trauma, but in rare cases can occur spontaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such leaks are rare, affecting about 1 in 20,000 people per year in the U.S., according to The Spinal CSF Leak Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts asked Badger to review her second MRI, taken in 2020. The imaging showed clear signs of “brain sag,” a condition where the brain begins to “sag” into the top of the spinal cord because there’s not enough cerebrospinal fluid to prop it up and hold it in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="S300" data-unit="hnp-houstonchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain sag was virtually imperceptible in the MRI taken three years earlier, so it’s likely that Roberts’ condition worsened to the point it could be seen, Badger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In her case, [the brain sag] was very apparent,” he said. “I think that’s why she had such severe cognitive symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s unclear what caused Roberts’ leak, but patients are sometimes predisposed to them if they have underlying connective tissue disorders, her doctors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless, Roberts and her family were ecstatic to finally have an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were so excited, because I was going to get my life back,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2 class="cci_subhead" title="CCI Subhead"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pinpointing the problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The imaging confirmed Roberts had a CSF leak, but doctors still needed to find it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Badger injected contrast dye into Roberts’ spinal canal, then used medical imaging to see how it flowed through her body. The technique, called a dynamic myelogram, helps to visualize the spinal cord and nearby nerves and soft tissue, and pinpoint the location of a leak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The myelogram revealed a leak on the right side of Roberts’ thoracic spine, near the midpoint of her back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Houston Methodist team initially tried to fix Roberts’ leak with an epidural blood patch, which involved injecting her own blood into the area around the spinal cord to seal it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="embed" data-server-side-rendered="true" class="e1ogmilg x100 f fdc aic mb32"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Roberts had a type of leak known as a CSF venous fistula, an abnormal connection where a blood vessel and the space around the spine where the cerebrospinal fluid is stored. That type of leak is even trickier to diagnose and cannot be fixed with a blood patch, said Dr. Insun Chong, a neuroradiologist at Houston Methodist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“No matter how much blood you inject, you’re still going to have that abnormal blood vessel there,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2021, Roberts opted for a surgery that involved cutting into her back and using surgical clips to seal the leak. At that time, there were no hospitals in Texas that offered the procedure. It took four months to schedule a trip to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surgery kept Roberts hospitalized for a week, but she noticed a “night-and-day” difference afterward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I could recall things. I could function,” she said. “Everything was just like it was before.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2 class="cci_subhead" title="CCI Subhead"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A simpler solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fix turned out to be temporary, though. Roberts’ headaches and memory loss returned by 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Houston Methodist neurosurgeon confirmed another leak, but offered Roberts an alternative to another trip to California. He suggested a novel, minimally-invasive procedure that involved inserting a catheter into Roberts’ groin to seal the leak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The surgeon, Dr. Kurt Yaeger, had never attempted the procedure, known as endoscopic embolization. But Roberts trusted him to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yaeger had used the technique to treat other problems, such as brain aneurysms and vascular malformations. But Roberts was his first patient with a CSF leak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“She was game to try it, and I very much appreciate her for that,” Yaeger said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yaeger began by inserting a catheter in a large blood vessel in her leg. He then moved the catheter to smaller blood vessels until he reached the leak in her spine. He then patched it with a substance that functions like super glue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts went home the day of the surgery, which has benefited her just as much as the more intensive procedure, her husband said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It was pretty much like plugging a flat tire,” Rick Roberts said. “She’s back to normal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h2 class="cci_subhead" title="CCI Subhead"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pioneering a treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating Roberts helped the Houston Methodist team recognize they could fill a void by using the minimally invasive procedure to treat more CSF leak patients. Yaeger, Chong and neurosurgeons Dr. Alex Hoang and Dr. Meng Huang have spearheaded the effort and are now treating multiple patients each week, mostly from Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Houston Methodist is the only hospital in Texas that offers treatment for the condition, according to the Spinal CSF Leak Foundation. The nonprofit also lists just one CSF leak practice apiece in Alabama, Arizona and Oklahoma, and none in 29 states, including Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and New Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scarcity is partly because the condition has long been underdiagnosed, Chong said. He believes that may be due in part to the fact that about two-thirds of leaks are diagnosed in women; studies have found that doctors are more likely to dismiss women who complain of chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not even a lot of people in the medical community know that this disease exists,” he said. “But it can be incredibly, incredibly debilitating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yaeger is hopeful the condition will become more recognized over time, and that more hospitals will offer treatment for the condition. He also believes the minimally invasive approach should become the standard of practice because of its benefit to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s very straightforward,” he said. “And once you do a couple procedures, it becomes more intuitive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts also hopes stories like hers will bring more attention to CSF leaks. She believes there are others with undiagnosed leaks who are suffering like she was, and who could be cured by a diagnosis and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It makes me very emotional, because I know how sick I was and how bad things were," she said. “Now I can enjoy my life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Houston Chronicle</author><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2025 11:14:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxPU2o5QW5sNWV5RmZ2VlBKTGJRZkpYRU1kRXZVTTMxVk5vdHFhU1BxVENoQ1hxWWlpZk9CUElERkd0ZGF4clA4Zmc3WWF1RjBCTVdRclE4eFEyaXJzNlhOcnEzUWtJVXF6UTF6WExDYWx6RDkyZHpqMjh4aklQbklxcUZBUEVfbUJiaGhIN2oyY3VQSEtWLW51MlpEazctczdIWWc</guid></item><item><title>根据医生的说法，为什么随着年龄的增长，你应该（可能）少喝酒-旧金山纪事报</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxPOHJWWEVXMVpqcVFxQTZZbmVNc1Zxdks0Q0w1WC1DVlZLRmRCSm9YcmcwZGEzMHlUQzlUUmVkd05QdTVMNHlqd2htRGptMy11YXdiMkc5MTZPSE5yZlFkeVhqZ0RhbFdpcEN4TDliXzhGcmdxOU1qM0MwWkswTUgtLWxlY3BGdUpTQUdHMFd4bmZtdWptUS1QY2oxOA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

However, a mosquito sample 3.5 weeks ago tested positive for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Finding the first positive birds is always significant because it serves as an early warning sign for West Nile virus activity," Gary Goodman, the district manager, said in a statement. "It confirms the virus is present in our region, helps us identify areas where infected mosquitoes may be found, and provides insight into where human cases could emerge later in the season."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is West Nile virus important?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Although West Nile virus has been in the United States since at least 1999, when it was discovered in New York, recent reports signal that it's showing up earlier in the season. Such is the case in Massachusetts, which recently discovered its first West Nile-carrying mosquitoes for the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Many scientists attribute this shift to a warming planet, which enables disease-spreading mosquitoes to stay active for longer periods throughout the year. Plus, these bloodsuckers are beginning to expand their ranges and move into higher altitudes. For instance, Connecticut officials are warning residents that a type of mosquito that can carry chikungunya, Zika, and dengue is expected to spread farther and faster across the state in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Symptoms of West Nile include fever, headache, body aches, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/about/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. However, the virus sometimes turns deadly. In 2024, the CDC reported &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/west-nile-virus/data-maps/historic-data.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:164;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;164&lt;/a&gt; deaths attributed to West Nile. The Bee reported that a man in the San Joaquin Valley, which borders Sacramento County, died partly because of the virus, making it the first West Nile-related death in the state this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about West Nile?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;According to the Bee, area officials are spraying insecticide to limit the spread of West Nile, and the Sacramento-Yolo Mosquito and Vector Control District is amping up its efforts to monitor and trap mosquitoes. The district also directs citizens to its &lt;a href="https://www.fightthebite.net" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:website;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, which has updates and mosquito bite prevention tips, including draining standing water that can attract mosquitoes and avoiding spending time outdoors at dawn and dusk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Meanwhile, communities across the globe are looking for ways to reduce their mosquito populations to protect residents from illnesses such as West Nile. For example, one Florida county is using X-rays to kill invasive mosquitoes. And one neighborhood in the Philippines is paying residents to bring in any mosquitoes they can capture, dead or alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/future-newsletter/?recjqV5UFJqWpkEeZ" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;good news&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;useful tips&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo Home</author><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2025 10:30:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxPcTdHQVdTVEY0WEpvVmdCVzM4T3J2ODY1WC1XbDl5S2dQVVNpX1JLRm9OcmU1THhETk12Rl9adEgyM2ZhTFQ1OTlkdzNYSkNPMWIyR3l6Y1BnTTVPMk5BQWhiZi1wY2lnOGhXLW85WnNrV2Y1N3BTZ1pFS1ZDTUdZR2UySThuNHd3Y1FLRUc3ZGg2T0k</guid></item><item><title>低收入者在社交互动中表现出更大的生理调节- PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirwFBVV95cUxQTFBoS3ZaWWJBNE5rMjdsM1J5cE45c3M0bDBYS012Y3hFRWJrcll4VEViT0xvdXlhSmdJUnBIWGFSTlk3T2NTM0dFUllWdEZIVERDak1HRWFaLXJ6Q1FTcXA5NGlsQVRRSjktRXlBcHdySk5kRjd5LV8zc1RZVnlaQWQ5S3VsTmNMYVV5X1pQZVd4c3JzTGxORUVrbHVsREhLSURGOWp5ak1JN0R6ZWV3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;People from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may be more tuned in to others during social encounters, even with strangers from different economic classes. According to a new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/09567976251350970" target="_blank"&gt;Psychological Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, individuals with lower socioeconomic status showed greater physiological attunement to their interaction partners than wealthier individuals did—regardless of the partner’s status. This greater sensitivity was also linked to more visible signs of comfort in those interacting with lower-income individuals. However, despite these dynamics, participants still reported liking people from similar class backgrounds more than those from different ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Socioeconomic status refers to a person’s social and economic standing in society. It typically includes a combination of income, education, occupation, and subjective assessments of status within one’s community or the broader society. People from higher socioeconomic backgrounds tend to have more access to resources and often face fewer threats to their social identity or opportunities. In contrast, lower-status individuals may experience more social obstacles, which can lead them to become more sensitive to their surroundings and others’ behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While prior research has explored how class shapes values, perceptions, and behavior, there has been little investigation into what actually happens during interactions between people from different economic backgrounds. The research team wanted to understand whether class shapes how socially attuned people are to one another, especially when they are meeting for the first time. They also wanted to test whether people from different backgrounds behave differently or are perceived differently in conversation, and whether people show more affinity for others who share their socioeconomic background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Around the world, growing social class divisions are raising real concerns about social cohesion,” said study author &lt;a href="https://socsc.smu.edu.sg/faculty/profile/6821/Jacinth-TAN" target="_blank"&gt;Jacinth J. X. Tan&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of psychology at the Singapore Management University, School of Social Sciences and head of the &lt;a href="https://jacinthjxtan.wixsite.com/smushlab" target="_blank"&gt;SMU Social Health Lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One common solution proposed by researchers and policymakers is to encourage more social mixing–or interaction between people from different social backgrounds. The hope is that greater mixing can build understanding and bridge divide. In fact, we are seeing greater calls for and efforts toward increasing diversity in higher education settings, workplaces and in communities, to foster greater mixing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, psychological research over the years has shown that contact between different groups is a double-edged sword: it can bring people together, but it can also highlight differences and create discomfort,” Tan explained. “In fact, recent studies have found that people often engage in fewer cross-class interactions than we might expect (&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/pspa0000302" target="_blank"&gt;Carey et al., 2022&lt;/a&gt;). When they do, they tend to feel less connected (&lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/xge0000258" target="_blank"&gt;Côté et al., 2017&lt;/a&gt;), and those who see themselves as lower in social class are especially hesitant to interact across class lines (&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/01461672251316690" target="_blank"&gt;Wu et al., 2025&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That led us to wonder how people might respond if we created a more relaxed, even enjoyable, one-on-one interaction, where people are subtly aware of each other’s social class? Would this foster a more positive experience that may override the natural preference for interacting with people from a similar background?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To examine these questions, the researchers recruited 264 adults from the San Francisco Bay Area and paired them into 130 same- or different-class dyads—each consisting of two strangers matched by age, gender, and race. Socioeconomic status was determined using a multidimensional index that combined income, education, subjective status, and parents’ education. Participants were then grouped into pairs that were either similar in status or distinctly different (with more than 1.5 standard deviations separating them).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each pair went through a series of structured tasks in a laboratory setting. These included casual conversations, a cooperative word game, and a public-speaking task judged by a neutral observer. Throughout the interaction, participants’ cardiovascular responses were monitored to assess changes in sympathetic nervous system activity—a signal of emotional and physiological arousal. Specifically, researchers measured “pre-ejection period,” a time-based indicator of heart activity that reflects how strongly the heart is contracting under stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physiological attunement was calculated by looking at how closely one participant’s physiological responses tracked with their partner’s responses over time. Behavioral cues, such as speaking clearly or fidgeting, were also recorded and analyzed by trained coders. After each task, participants completed surveys rating how much they liked their partner and how similar they felt to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most consistent finding across physiological, behavioral, and self-report measures was that people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds were more responsive to their partners. Their physiological responses were more closely linked to those of their partner, suggesting they were paying more attention to how their partner was feeling or reacting. This was true regardless of whether they were paired with someone of similar or different status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, participants in general appeared more relaxed and at ease when paired with a lower-income partner. This was evident in clearer speech and less fidgeting—nonverbal signs of comfort that were observed more often in interactions with low-status individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this did not translate into greater social liking. When asked how much they enjoyed the interaction or how similar they felt to their partner, participants consistently rated those from similar class backgrounds more favorably. This preference for similarity, known as homophily, appeared to override the positive experience of being paired with a socially attuned and comforting partner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our main findings revealed an interesting disconnect between automatic (physiologic and behavioral) versus more conscious (self-report) measures,” Tan told PsyPost. “Most of the interactions appeared positive—our video coding of interactions did not detect differences in positivity between cross-class or same-class interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, we observed some asymmetries in interpersonal physiologic and behavioural responses based on participants’ social class backgrounds: Lower social class participants were more attentive/attuned to their interaction partners–based on our physiological linkage measure–regardless of the social class of interaction partners. This aligns with the broader research finding that lower social class individuals are generally more vigilant in navigating their social world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Participants regardless of social class also appeared more comfortable–based on our coding of nonverbal behaviors–when interacting with partners from lower social class backgrounds,” Tan continued. “Interestingly, at the end of the interaction, participants still reported liking partners in same-class interactions more than in cross-class interactions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These distinct patterns tell us that the underlying nature of interactions is not completely obvious. While interactions appeared generally positive, lower social class individuals (compared to higher social class individuals) were more psychologically invested in the interaction by being more attentive, and this may have helped others feel more comfortable around them. However, these interpersonal processes did not override same-class preferences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s likely that a one-time positive interaction is insufficient to increase cross-class liking, so it would be interesting to see if repeated interactions would override same-class preferences over time. It’s also possible that engaging in a novel cross-class interaction is quite effortful–especially for individuals from lower social class backgrounds–and this can undermine the quality and experience of cross-class interactions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of conversational dynamics, the researchers expected that individuals from wealthier backgrounds might take more control of the conversation. But the study did not find evidence for this. People from different classes were equally likely to dominate or follow in conversation. The researchers suggest this may have been influenced by the structured nature of the interactions, which gave both participants equal chances to speak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a passive observer blind to the social class of participants (I sat through almost all the dyadic interactions to supervise the study–hidden, of course), it was not always obvious whether participants were similar or different in social class,” Tan said, “even though we paired them to be, until their conversation touched on things like where they went to school, what they did for a living, favourite vacation spot, the best gift they’ve given or received. We did observe, based on our manipulation checks, that participants quite accurately judged the social class of their interaction partners. So it seems that while social class cues are not always visible, they are still detectable through things we talk about.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study offers important insights into how class influences the way people connect with each other during first-time meetings. But it also has limitations. Most notably, the sample was drawn entirely from the San Francisco Bay Area, a region with its own unique cultural and economic landscape. This may limit how broadly the findings apply to other populations. The racial composition of the sample also skewed toward majority groups, which made it difficult to study how race and class might interact during these encounters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that the interactions were relatively brief and followed a structured format. While this approach ensured consistency across participants, it may not fully capture the subtleties of real-world conversations that unfold over longer periods or in less formal settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The major caveat/limitation is with the racial representation of our sample, as well as our inability to examine the role of other possible intersecting identities such as gender and race,” Tan noted. “Our study focused on isolating the role of social class by matching participant dyads on age, gender, and race.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research may explore whether repeated interactions, rather than one-time encounters, can shift these patterns. It would also be helpful to examine whether similar results emerge in other regions or among more racially and culturally diverse populations. Understanding how to promote comfort and connection across class lines may play an important role in building more inclusive workplaces, schools, and communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The long-term goal is definitely to examine these patterns in different social settings (e.g., in schools, workplaces), in a different cultural context (e.g., non-Western), so see if the patterns hold or if patterns may vary,” Tan explained. “I am also interested in studying ways to improve the quality of cross-class interactions by reducing the observed social class asymmetries in attention and feelings of comfort during such interactions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For instance, could such asymmetries be reduced in a setting completely free of social class cues or information? Could we reduce asymmetries by encouraging empathic curiosity prior to a cross-class interaction, such as by having people prepare questions that reflect interest in learning about the person and encourage sharing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/09567976251350970" target="_blank"&gt;Socioeconomic Status Shapes Dyadic Interactions: Examining Behavioral and Physiologic Responses&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Jacinth J.

&lt;p&gt;The world's first telescope, crafted in 1608 by the Dutch eyeglass maker &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.space.com/21950-who-invented-the-telescope.html" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.space.com/21950-who-invented-the-telescope.html" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hans Lippershey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, led to stunning technologies that would later revolutionize our understanding of the universe. While his telescope used simple lenses to magnify objects to about three times their size, later scientists built on this concept to peer into the depths of outer space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some telescopes are more powerful than others, enabling us to spot distant stars and galaxies and allowing researchers to study extreme phenomena like &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/black-holes" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/black-holes"&gt;&lt;u&gt;black holes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/james-webb-telescope-zooms-in-on-bizarre-einstein-ring-caused-by-bending-of-the-universe" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/james-webb-telescope-zooms-in-on-bizarre-einstein-ring-caused-by-bending-of-the-universe"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Einstein rings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. So, what's the most powerful telescope, and how far can it see into space?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer isn't surprising to anyone familiar with today's headlines: The most powerful telescope is presently the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/james-webb-space-telescope" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/james-webb-space-telescope"&gt;&lt;u&gt;James Webb Space Telescope&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/tag/james-webb-space-telescope" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/tag/james-webb-space-telescope"&gt;JWST&lt;/a&gt;), which was launched in December 2021 to detect &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/50260-infrared-radiation.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/50260-infrared-radiation.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;infrared&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and near-infrared wavelengths, or wavelengths on the electromagnetic spectrum that are invisible to humans but can be felt as heat.

These problems range from light pollution to "atmospheric turbulence," which is the random movement of air. Such factors can blur and distort images and limit a telescope's ability to see deeply into space. Space, on the other hand, is darker and free of these problems, so many of our strongest telescopes are placed well beyond Earth's atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of James Webb, the telescope sits at a vantage point nearly 1 million miles (1.5 million kilometers) from Earth at a Lagrange point, or a point that has just the right gravitational balance for satellites to stay stable in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="caption-text"&gt;The galaxy JADES-GS-z14-0, the current contender for the most distant in the universe, is shown in the pullout taken by the James Webb Space Telescope.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: NASA, ESA, CSA, STScI, B.

It takes light from our sun &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/jupiter-facts/" target="_blank" data-url="https://science.nasa.gov/jupiter/jupiter-facts/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;43.2 minutes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to reach Jupiter, but only 8 minutes to reach Earth. The distance to the outermost depths of the cosmos is vastly farther, which complicates the calculations. Measuring how far a telescope can see into space is not a straightforward process, Jakobsen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two hurdles astronomers regularly need to account for are the expansion of the universe and the finite &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/what-is-the-speed-of-light" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/what-is-the-speed-of-light"&gt;&lt;u&gt;speed of light&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he said. Astronomers bypass these complications by measuring the redshift of distant celestial bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redshift is what we see as celestial bodies accelerate farther and farther away from us. As the universe expands, the light emitted by faraway objects stretches to longer and "redder" wavelengths. The farther and longer the light travels, the greater its redshift becomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, one of the farthest known redshift contenders is the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/james-webb-telescope-discovers-the-2-earliest-galaxies-in-the-known-universe-and-1-is-shockingly-big" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/space/cosmology/james-webb-telescope-discovers-the-2-earliest-galaxies-in-the-known-universe-and-1-is-shockingly-big"&gt;&lt;u&gt;galaxy JADES-GS-z14-0&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Jakobsen said. Its redshift puts it at about 290 million years after the Big Bang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another contender, which has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, is the galaxy &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/previously-unimaginable-james-webb-telescope-breaks-its-own-record-again-discovering-farthest-known-galaxy-in-the-universe" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/space/astronomy/previously-unimaginable-james-webb-telescope-breaks-its-own-record-again-discovering-farthest-known-galaxy-in-the-universe"&gt;&lt;u&gt;MoM-z14&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has been dated to a mere 280 million years after the Big Bang.

Now, researchers have found a way to turn this weakness into strength -- by transplanting healthy mitochondria into the tumor environment. In advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), combining mitochondrial transplantation with cisplatin not only enhanced immune cell infiltration but also reversed tumor metabolism and improved the drug's effectiveness. This innovative approach transforms mitochondria from mere energy suppliers into active allies in cancer therapy, showing potential to reshape how we treat aggressive lung tumors.&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;div id="text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lung cancer causes more deaths than any other cancer worldwide, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for 85% of cases. Chemotherapy is the first-line treatment for advanced NSCLC, yet its effectiveness is hampered by toxic side effects and emerging resistance. Moreover, chemotherapy damages immune cells and reduces their presence in the tumor microenvironment, limiting long-term control. Adding to this challenge, tumors can hijack immune cell mitochondria through nanotube-like structures, further dampening immunity. Immunotherapy has improved outcomes for some, but many patients still fail to respond. Due to these limitations, there is a pressing need for strategies that restore immune power and metabolic balance during chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers from Tongji University School of Medicine and Nantong University published a study in &lt;em&gt;Cancer Biology &amp;amp; Medicine&lt;/em&gt; that introduces a novel approach to lung cancer therapy. They investigated whether direct mitochondrial transplantation could enhance the effects of chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC. By combining functional mitochondria with cisplatin, the team aimed to not only improve tumor response but also restore immune vigor inside the tumor microenvironment. Their findings mark a significant step toward integrative treatments that energize both cells and immunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers isolated functional mitochondria from human cardiomyocytes -- cells known for their high energy output -- and transplanted them into NSCLC tumor models, both in vitro and in vivo. Alone, mitochondrial transplantation did not harm cancer cells, but when combined with cisplatin, it significantly amplified tumor suppression. This synergy reduced the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; of cisplatin from 12.93 μM to 6.7 μM, indicating greater drug sensitivity. Tumors in mice shrank more dramatically with the combination therapy than with chemotherapy alone, and immune infiltration markedly increased. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a striking shift in tumor metabolism: downregulation of glycolysis and hypoxia genes, and upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation pathways -- reversing the Warburg effect. Markers of cell proliferation (Ki67, P53) and stemness (HIF-1α, CD44, CD133) were suppressed. Importantly, mitochondrial transplantation also restored mitochondrial activity in immune cells, enhancing the function of T cells and natural killer (NK) cells. The treatment caused no additional toxicity and preserved body weight and organ integrity. This work demonstrates that mitochondria can serve as metabolic and immunologic reinforcements, transforming the tumor landscape into one more susceptible to immune attack and chemotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This research introduces a powerful dual-action strategy," said Dr. Liuliu Yuan, lead investigator of the study. "By replenishing immune cells with functional mitochondria, we are not just enhancing their energy -- but restoring their ability to fight. At the same time, tumor cells become more vulnerable to chemotherapy. It's like rearming the immune system while disarming the tumor. This could be a promising avenue for patients who don't respond well to conventional treatment."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This discovery lays the groundwork for a new therapeutic paradigm -- one that leverages the mitochondria's unique biology to augment cancer treatment. In patients with advanced NSCLC, mitochondrial transplantation could enhance the effects of existing chemotherapy drugs while minimizing immune suppression. Beyond lung cancer, this approach may extend to other tumors where immune dysfunction and metabolic reprogramming are barriers to treatment success. With further refinement and clinical trials, mitochondrial transfer could evolve into a versatile platform for combination therapies, helping clinicians push past the current limits of cancer care and into a new era of bioenergetic and immune restoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

That way, you might think, aging is a linear, steady, and yearly process. Well, you might have to think again because a new landmark study begs to differ from that worn-out concept.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking new study has revealed that your body doesn’t age in a straight line. Instead, it hits a sudden ‘turning point’, and much earlier than most people would guess. Using detailed proteomic age clocks, the team tracked age-related protein changes in tissue samples from dozens of donors, uncovering that blood vessels, the adrenal glands, and other systems begin aging faster than many expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the study say?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study, published recently in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(25)00749-4?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867425007494%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Cell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, has identified a turning point at which that acceleration typically takes place: at around age 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;After this time, the trajectory at which your tissues and organs age is steeper than the decades preceding, according to a study of proteins in human bodies across a wide range of adult ages, and your veins are among the fastest to decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As per a team led by scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, "Based on aging-associated protein changes, we developed tissue-specific proteomic age clocks and characterized organ-level aging trajectories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Temporal analysis revealed an aging inflection around age 50, with blood vessels being a tissue that ages early and is markedly susceptible to aging." They added, "Together, our findings lay the groundwork for a systems-level understanding of human aging through the lens of proteins."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers gathered tissue samples from 76 organ donors ranging in age from 14 to 68, all of whom had died due to accidental traumatic brain injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collected samples spanned seven bodily systems: the cardiovascular system (including the heart and aorta), the digestive system (liver, pancreas, and intestines), the immune system (spleen and lymph nodes), the endocrine system (adrenal glands and white fat tissue), the respiratory system (lungs), the integumentary system (skin), and the musculoskeletal system (muscle tissue). Blood samples were also taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using these, the team assembled a comprehensive catalog of proteins present in each system, carefully tracking how their abundance varied with donor age. By cross-referencing their data with a disease-gene database, they identified 48 proteins tied to specific illnesses that showed increased expression as age advanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These proteins were linked to conditions like heart disease, tissue scarring, fatty liver, and liver tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most dramatic shifts were seen in donors between the ages of 45 and 55. During this period, many tissues experienced significant proteomic changes, especially in the aorta, which appeared highly vulnerable to aging. Notably, longer-lasting alterations were also observed in the pancreas and spleen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study highlights a key inflection point where the body’s aging process appears to intensify. To validate their findings, researchers isolated one protein tied to aging from mouse aortas and injected it into younger mice. These treated mice showed diminished physical abilities, weaker grip strength, reduced endurance, and poorer balance and coordination compared to untreated controls. They also displayed clear biological markers of vascular aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, "Our study is poised to construct a comprehensive multi-tissue proteomic atlas spanning 50 years of the entire human aging process, elucidating the mechanisms behind proteostasis imbalance in aged organs and revealing both universal and tissue-specific aging patterns."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The added, "These insights may facilitate the development of targeted interventions for aging and age-related diseases, paving the way to improve the health of older adults."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does it mean, in simpler words?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Aging is not linear:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Contrary to the traditional view of gradual aging, this research shows that human aging accelerates sharply between the ages of 45 and 55, with the most pronounced changes at around age 50. This represents a systemic shift in organ and tissue function that outpaces earlier decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all organs age equally. The earliest detectable signs appear in the adrenal glands by age 30, suggesting that hormonal systems may trigger broader systemic aging later on. Meanwhile, the aorta, your body's primary artery, shows the most dramatic protein-level decline, indicating vascular aging may act as a conduit for aging signals that affect multiple tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Proteins work like body clocks:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scientists constructed tissue-specific proteomic clocks by analyzing 48 key proteins linked to age-related diseases, such as cardiovascular dysfunction, fibrosis, and metabolic disorders.

The pancreas, spleen, and aorta experience accelerated aging by age 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Muscles and skin tend to follow later, often becoming noticeably weaker or thinner after the mid-50s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery aligns with observable symptoms in many people, declining energy, slower metabolism, hormonal imbalance, and reduced resilience to stress all tend to surface around this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why the age 50 acts as a marker?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="77"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not exactly mid-life; it’s not old age either. However, age 50 represents a milestone when tissues across several systems begin declining faster than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that while aging begins in some tissues as early as your 30s, a distinct shift happens at age 50, where the rate of biological deterioration suddenly speeds up. While 50 appears to be a major biological shift, other studies support the idea that aging occurs in waves rather than in a slow, steady decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="82"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most striking findings involves the aorta, your body’s largest artery. Proteins like GAS6, which are linked to cellular stress and tissue decline, increase dramatically in this area. When scientists introduced these proteins into younger animal models, they induced signs of premature aging, including reduced strength and impaired cardiovascular function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This data suggests that vascular aging could act as a master switch, sending signals that impact the rest of the body’s aging trajectory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="87"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="88"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this means for your health and wellness (and what can you do to slow down aging)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we can’t stop aging, these findings open up new strategies to slow its acceleration, especially if you act before hitting the turning point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="91"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="93"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Midlife matters, start early:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Midlife is not just ‘later life’, it can be the fulcrum of your long-term health. Proactive lifestyle habits like exercise, balanced diet, sleep quality, and stress management can slow aging, not just in your 60s, but starting decades earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="97"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Prioritize vascular health:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since vascular tissue seems to age first and fastest, take steps to support your arteries. Eat a heart-healthy diet (low in processed foods, high in fiber and omega-3s). Manage blood pressure and cholesterol. Incorporate aerobic exercise like walking, cycling, or swimming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="100"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Antioxidants and anti-inflammatory foods:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cellular stress from free radicals plays a role in aging. Include foods rich in vitamin C, polyphenols, and flavonoids like berries, green tea, turmeric, and leafy greens. Avoid smoking, limit alcohol, and minimize exposure to environmental toxins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="105"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Monitor key metrics:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Protein clocks offer precision in measuring biological age, think organ-specific aging (e.g., heart vs. endocrine system). While these tools are primarily research-based now, being aware of your metrics, like blood pressure, glucose, lipids, and inflammation, can guide personalized prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="108"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Support hormonal balance:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; The adrenal glands influence everything from energy to immune response. Changes in the adrenal gland and metabolic hormones may precede broader aging. Maintaining stable hormone function, through nutrition, sleep, and stress reduction, might delay a rapid decline in other systems.

It's praised for cancer prevention, gut health, bone support, and anti-inflammatory benefits. It’s a staple in countless health-conscious diets and often recommended by nutritionists for weight management and heart support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even this highly nutritious vegetable, with all the good press, comes with some lesser-known downsides that often go unnoticed. While generally safe and healthy for most people, broccoli can trigger digestive issues, interfere with thyroid function, and even affect medication absorption under certain circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Digestive discomfort: Gas, bloating, and cramping&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broccoli is a high-fiber vegetable that contains raffinose, a complex sugar that is poorly digested in the human gut. This sugar ferments in the large intestine, producing gas and potentially causing bloating and abdominal cramps. A controlled &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8025206/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; also showed broccoli significantly altered gut microbiota: Bacteroidetes increased and Firmicutes decreased, shifting metabolic pathways, while potentially contributing to gas or bowel changes in sensitive people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why it matters:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; People with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or a sensitive gastrointestinal system are especially prone to these effects. Broccoli is also high in FODMAPs, fermentable short-chain carbohydrates that can exacerbate IBS symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Health tip:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Steaming or lightly cooking broccoli can help break down these sugars and make it easier to digest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Affects thyroid function&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most commonly overlooked concerns with broccoli is its &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0753332217343512#:~:text=Abstract,balance%20of%20the%20thyroid%20gland." rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;goitrogenic content&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Broccoli, like other cruciferous vegetables (e.g., kale, cabbage), contains goitrogens, compounds (goitrins, thiocyanates, flavonoids) that can inhibit iodine uptake and disrupt thyroid hormone production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Who should be cautious:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Individuals with existing thyroid disorders, such as hypothyroidism, should avoid consuming large amounts of raw broccoli. For people with hypothyroidism or iodine deficiency, eating excessive amounts (particularly raw) may contribute to goiter or slowed thyroid function. Cooking helps deactivate many of the goitrogenic compounds, making it a safer option for those at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Health tip:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; moderate intake (1-2 cups cooked a few times per week) and prefer lightly steamed or cooked forms to reduce goitrogenic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Interaction with blood thinners&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broccoli is high in vitamin K, which plays a key role in blood clotting. That means, while beneficial in most cases, it can counteract the effects of warfarin and other &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://patienteducation.osumc.edu/Documents/prevent-bleeding-blood-thinners.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;anticoagulant medications&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; like warfarin (Coumadin) if consumed in large quantities or inconsistently. Suddenly increasing broccoli intake, or reducing it, can destabilize INR levels. People on such medications should work with their healthcare provider for consistent dietary planning around vitamin K foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Health tip:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you are on blood thinners, consult your healthcare provider to maintain a consistent intake of vitamin K rather than eliminating it altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;High fiber shock&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broccoli is high in insoluble fiber, which promotes regular bowel movements and satiety. However, introducing &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3435786/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;too much fiber&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; too quickly can cause digestive overload from sudden intake, leading to constipation, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="56"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Who are at risk:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Especially, people transitioning from a low-fiber diet who suddenly add large amounts of broccoli may experience GI distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Health tip:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Increase your intake gradually and drink plenty of water to help your digestive system adjust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Interference with mineral absorption&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broccoli also contains oxalates and phytates, natural compounds that can bind to minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and iron, reducing their bioavailability. While not a concern in moderate amounts, excessive consumption of broccoli (especially raw) over time could contribute to &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9268622/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;minor deficiencies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, particularly in people with already low mineral levels or poor absorption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="71"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="72"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sulforaphane and supplemental risks&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broccoli is rich in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6804255/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;sulforaphane&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, a phytochemical praised for anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and metabolic benefits. In dietary amounts through regular broccoli consumption, sulforaphane is considered safe. However, high-dose supplements containing this compound can stress the liver or kidneys, causing mild side effects such as gas, constipation, diarrhea, and the potential to interfere with drugs metabolized via CYP enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="78"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;As clinical evidence on long-term safety remains limited, pregnant or breastfeeding individuals are advised to rely on whole-food sources rather than concentrated extracts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="80"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Health tip:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stick to whole foods rather than relying on isolated broccoli extracts or pills, unless advised by a qualified healthcare provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="83"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="84"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Genotoxicity claims&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="85"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some laboratory and animal studies have flagged potential genotoxic or cytotoxic effects from certain broccoli compounds or extracts, particularly glucosinolate breakdown products like isothiocyanates and indoles. But the relevance of these findings to typical human consumption is unclear, and overall harm has not been demonstrated in dietary amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="89"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281057229_Broccoli_seed_extract_Genotoxicity_and_subchronic_toxicity_studies" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; has shown that the cancer-prevention potential generally outweighs theoretical risks, but more human trials are needed to clarify the balance in high-dose scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="92"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="93"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potential allergic or skin reactions&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="94"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broccoli-related allergic reactions are very rare, but they can include skin rash, hives, an itchy throat, swelling of the lips or tongue, or respiratory symptoms in hypersensitive individuals. Cases of contact dermatitis have been documented in people handling raw broccoli or its stems, though such reactions are the exception, not the rule. If you notice unusual symptoms after eating broccoli, discontinue consumption and consult a healthcare professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="98"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="100"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="101"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to enjoy broccoli safely&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="102"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broccoli is undoubtedly one of the most nutritious vegetables you can eat. Its health benefits far outweigh its risks for most people. But like any food, even the healthiest option can become problematic in excess or for specific health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="105"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The safest practice: keeping it moderate. For most people, 1-2 cups of cooked broccoli a few times weekly provides benefits without risking side effects. While incorporating broccoli into your daily diet, don’t go overboard; introduce it gradually. If fiber intake has been low, start slow to prevent gas or bloating. Monitor portion sizes if you’re on thyroid meds, blood thinners, or mineral supplements. Moreover, cook it lightly. Steaming or sautéing helps deactivate goitrogens and eases fiber-related digestion issues. Pick whole foods over high-dose sulforaphane supplements unless supervised by a healthcare provider. Finally, always consult your doctor, especially if you take warfarin, have thyroid disease, IBS, or plan to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="109"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Barron Trump Missing From Dad’s Side for MONTHS: Questions Swirl Around His Absence | WATCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="111"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2025 05:37:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>视频：当妈妈宠物兄弟姐妹时， “嫉妒”金毛猎犬给予侧眼- AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMie0FVX3lxTE9DUUdLMlRTRmZnYXFqa2JybGlkOHZMeVExTjdwWlJYYjJpMHNTcEt6R3FGOUpGQlFIYjlrVmhMTUN2d1d5SzhXTzV5ZG9WLVBvN2FYRmNUa2hRQXROSEk4c1diOHVXbnNUZVd0ckc5elhJemlKb0Y0aDZiYw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;(Photo Credit: @daisythegoldiee/Instagram)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some pet parents must have felt the glare from their dogs when they show some love to other animals. To provide the perfect example, this Instagram video shows how a &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/golden-retriever" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Golden Retriever;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Golden Retriever&lt;/a&gt; named Daisy becomes “jealous.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her owner captures a few moments where the furbaby gives her a major side-eye whenever the latter pets her sibling. In the caption, the uploader mentions, “Daisy doesn’t tolerate cheaters.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Golden Retriever proves she’s the ‘jealous type’ when mom pets sibling in video&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a cute and funny dog video on Instagram, an owner films their Golden Retriever, Daisy, subtly showing her jealousy. It begins with the pet parent relaxing on a couch with another pup on her lap. The dog mom pets Daisy’s sibling’s head, then focuses the camera on the Golden, who is sitting on the other corner of the couch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daisy seems to throw daggers at her owner with her eyes. Explaining the context, an on-screen line mentions that the pup is usually not the “jealous type.” However, the pet parent caught her “looking at me like this” on that occasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same thing happens in the next scene, when the &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/184827-great-pyrenees-loves-to-get-weighed-for-treats-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:dog;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;dog&lt;/a&gt; mom pets the other pup in front of Daisy — the latter glares at her human from outside that room. The uploader shares three instances in which the Golden shows her jealousy. Her reaction appears more dramatic because of the background score, which is “All By Myself” by Celine Dion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, viewers thoroughly enjoyed the video of the Golden Retriever. A user joked, “Proof that looks can kill. Of guilt.” Another wrote, “That side-eye says everything. Daisy’s not playing around!” Many found the pup’s side-eye hilarious and called it “deadly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An individual justified the dog’s emotions and commented, “Jealousy is just love in disguise.” A few funny comments also exclaimed: “Oh the betrayal,” “Justice for Daisy!,” and “The GUILT TRIP.” Since the upload, the Instagram Reel has garnered over 18k likes and 150k views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com/news/184884-golden-retriever-side-eye-mom-pets-sibling-video" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Video: ‘Jealous’ Golden Retriever Gives Side Eye When Mom Pets Sibling;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Video: ‘Jealous’ Golden Retriever Gives Side Eye When Mom Pets Sibling&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://dogtime.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:DogTime;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;DogTime&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2025 05:00:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMie0FVX3lxTE9DUUdLMlRTRmZnYXFqa2JybGlkOHZMeVExTjdwWlJYYjJpMHNTcEt6R3FGOUpGQlFIYjlrVmhMTUN2d1d5SzhXTzV5ZG9WLVBvN2FYRmNUa2hRQXROSEk4c1diOHVXbnNUZVd0ckc5elhJemlKb0Y0aDZiYw</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法， 5种实际上可以缓解关节炎症状的“坏”食物- EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE03OXkxZER5S0dPUWVoVEpFbHRmV1NCcUVVM2N3eHV0WDdkRm9Mc29EcWVudXdtTVhUN1d5NjRDOEFZR1M2aTRYRlhqNTVVZEVrMm5PQnliVEVydHBvaG1OOVdMRXo2c1dqZVM3X3dQdUhsQ2EyN3FQVw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To put these myths to rest, we asked dietitians to weigh in on foods we’re often told are problematic for arthritis that may actually help relieve the pain. Here are their top picks.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-canned-fish"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Canned Fish &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned fish is packed with nutrients. Plus, it’s convenient, affordable and has a nice long shelf life. Yet, many people avoid it due to misunderstandings surrounding the canning process, materials and ingredients. Truth is, if you have arthritis, canned fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, anchovies, sardines and herring should be among your go-to foods. Why? “Arthritis can appear with different faces, however each form shares a similar symptom—&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-inflammation-8766645" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;inflammation&lt;/a&gt;,” says &lt;a href="https://www.csulb.edu/college-of-health-human-services/family-and-consumer-sciences/page/dr-dustin-moore" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Dustin Moore, Ph.D., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a nutrition lecturer at California State University Long Beach and creator of the Substack Public Health Dad.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And these fatty fish are all loaded with omega-3 fats that fight inflammation, specifically DHA and EPA. Omega-3s are so powerful, in fact, they’re our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-nutrient-to-lower-inflammation-8783795" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;No. 1 nutrient to reduce inflammation&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re living with rheumatoid arthritis, fatty fish are especially worthy of a place in your pantry. Research has found that people with RA who consume more omega-3 fats may experience less pain and fewer flare-ups.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-dairy"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Dairy  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Many people believe dairy is inflammatory,” says Texas-based registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarah-anne-williams123/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Sarah Williams, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. “However, dairy products can provide calcium and vitamin D, which are crucial for bone density and joint health.” Despite the noise calling out dairy as an &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2056066/heres-what-a-dietitian-says-about-dairy-causing-inflammation/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;inflammatory food&lt;/a&gt;, a substantial body of research suggests dairy foods don’t promote inflammation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, unless you have a dairy allergy or sensitivity, there’s no reason to avoid this food group, say Moore and Williams.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;But if you have to choose one dairy food to calm your symptoms, make it yogurt. One study found that people who frequently consumed yogurt had lower blood markers of inflammation than people who didn’t eat yogurt.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-potatoes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Potatoes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you heard it from your favorite athlete or influencer, nightshade vegetables, like potatoes, are frequently blamed for promoting inflammation. As a result, many people with arthritis assume they can’t eat them. “People [also] label potatoes as unhealthy due to their high carbohydrate content, which some associate with weight gain and inflammation,” says Williams. “But, they’re actually rich in potassium, vitamin C and antioxidants, which may be beneficial to those with arthritis.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you love spuds, you may not have to avoid them. According to the Arthritis Foundation, the best way to know if potatoes trigger your symptoms is to remove them from your diet for a couple of weeks, then reintroduce them and see how you feel. If they make you ache, avoid them.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; If not, go ahead and enjoy! In the event that white potatoes don’t agree with you, consider other varieties, like &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7561504/health-benefits-of-purple-potatoes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;purple potatoes&lt;/a&gt;. They’re rich in compounds that may reduce inflammation, says the Arthritis Foundation. Also good to know: sweet potatoes don’t fall under the nightshade umbrella, so they’re always a safe choice.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-seed-oils"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Seed Oils  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/do-seed-oils-cause-inflammation-8711680" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Seed oils&lt;/a&gt; are a controversial topic in today’s nutrition landscape. These oils are rich in an unsaturated fat called linoleic acid, which is frequently blamed for inflammation. However, the research doesn’t add up. Consider the results of a systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 studies that found that seed oils, specifically canola, flaxseed and sesame seed oils, helped decrease oxidative stress and improved blood lipid and blood sugar levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re wondering about soybean oil, you can relax about that, too. Additional research has found that soybean oil doesn’t impact inflammation one way or the other.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And, like seed oils, it’s heart-healthy. That’s especially important for anyone with RA, as this condition may increase the risk of heart failure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-tomatoes"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Tomatoes  &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7962467/do-tomatoes-cause-inflammation-what-a-dietitian-has-to-say/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Tomatoes&lt;/a&gt; are another member of the nightshade family that many people with arthritis avoid. However, Williams notes they may not need to, especially since tomatoes contain lycopene, an antioxidant that fights inflammation. For example, one study found that people with knee osteoarthritis had lower blood lycopene levels than people without arthritis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; They also had lower levels of vitamin E, a fat-soluble vitamin found in foods like olive oil and avocados. What does that have to do with tomatoes? Avocados and olive oil also contain healthy fat that helps your body better absorb lycopene from tomatoes. So, dig into a tomato-and-avocado salad drizzled with olive oil for a trifecta of inflammation-calming nutrients.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nutrition experts agree most foods can fit into a balanced diet in moderation, even when you have a condition like arthritis. However, there are a few exceptions. “Some foods may contribute to increased inflammation for certain people, so being mindful of how your body responds can help with arthritis management,” says Williams. These include fried foods, sugary beverages and excess alcohol, which may be worth limiting or adjusting if they set off your symptoms.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nutrition experts agree that food can play a pivotal role in helping manage arthritis pain. However, there’s a lot of misinformation circulating on the best and worst foods for arthritis. While you might have heard that canned fish, dairy, potatoes, seed oils and tomatoes are bad for arthritis, nutrition experts say otherwise. For most people living with arthritis, these nutritious foods may actually improve symptoms and overall health. And remember, arthritis isn’t just about what you eat. If you’re experiencing unrelenting arthritis pain, speak with your health care professional, who can help you find the best therapies to manage your condition.&lt;br&gt;

That was also the year his father was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had this contrast, seeing what it’s like to lose your physical function, then also experiencing my own journey of gaining more physical function. It became apparent to me that &lt;a href="/topic/exercise"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; was much more than just a tool for athleticism and aesthetics,” &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.coachdannymatranga.com/"&gt;Matranga&lt;/a&gt; explains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I said, ‘You know what? I cannot save my dad, I cannot fix this, but I can hopefully empower other people to not only develop their body, but also protect against disease.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, he became a personal trainer, choosing to specialise in &lt;a href="/topic/strength-training"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; due to the emerging research around its benefits for both body and brain. Since then, further studies have cemented this training method’s status as a top option for those looking to exercise for health, &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/best-exercises-longevity-lifting-weights-trainer-b2767864.html"&gt;longevity&lt;/a&gt; and maintaining physical function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why it is believed by many, Matranga among them, to be the most important type of exercise you can do to live well into your later years. Read on to find out more about the science-backed benefits, and how to get started. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;First things first: all exercise is good&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because strength training is framed as “the best” here, that doesn’t mean other types of exercise are without merit. Any physical activity you do is highly likely to provide myriad benefits – movement truly is medicine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 2011 study published in &lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21846575/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lancet &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;monitored the medical screenings of 416,175 people over the course of 12 years, then split participants into one of five activity level groups: inactive, low, medium, high or very high. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those in the low activity group completed an average of roughly 15 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per day, but this accessible figure still saw them record a three-year longer life expectancy than those in the inactive group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every additional 15 minutes of daily exercise beyond the minimum amount of 15 minutes a day further reduced all-cause mortality by 4 per cent and all-cancer mortality by 1 per cent,” the study states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderate-intensity exercise is any form of activity that elevates your heart rate and has you breathing harder, but still allows you to hold a conversation – be that strength training, walking, running, cycling or otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strength training, however, has a whole host of bonus benefits that make it a wise use of your time – particularly when viewed through a longevity lens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 fnzsRm"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/04/10/27/iStock-1832639811.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/04/10/27/iStock-1832639811.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/04/10/27/iStock-1832639811.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Strength training can help maintain physical and mental function as you age" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-231524"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Strength training can help maintain physical and mental function as you age&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/longevity-ageing-exercise-personal-trainer-b2779460.html"&gt;I’m a trainer specialising in longevity – these are the five changes that have the biggest impact on my clients&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bonus benefits of strength training, especially as you age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarcopenia and dynapenia refer to the age-related loss of muscle mass and muscle strength or function. According &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2804956/"&gt;to a review &lt;/a&gt;published in the &lt;em&gt;Current Opinion in Clinical Nutrition and Metabolic Care&lt;/em&gt;, “muscle mass decreases by approximately 3 to 8 per cent per decade after the age of 30, and this rate of decline is even higher after the age of 60”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further possible effects of sarcopenia and dynapenia include an increased risk of falls and reduced physical capacity, as well as a consequent increase in fat mass, decreased bone density, increased joint stiffness and “increased incidence of insulin resistance in the elderly”, the review later adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All these changes have probable implications for several conditions, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, heart disease and osteoporosis,” it concludes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strength training, which bolsters muscles, bones, tendons and ligaments while also improving balance, coordination and heart health, is the natural antidote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Live Active Successful Ageing study, published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38911477/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;British Medical Journal Open Sport and Exercise Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; journal in 2024, explored the long-term effects of strength training – otherwise known as resistance training – on adults at retirement age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of participants were placed in one of three groups: those put through a year of supervised resistance training with heavy loads (relative to the individual’s strength level), those tasked with completing regular moderate-intensity training, and a non-exercising control group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four years on, 369 participants returned for an assessment – the average age was 71 years, and 61 per cent were women. Those who lifted heavy weights still had higher strength levels then before they started the programme, whereas the other two groups saw a decrease. They also maintained higher levels of lean body mass (or muscle) than the other two groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study concluded: “In well-functioning older adults at retirement age, one year of heavy resistance may induce long-lasting beneficial effects by preserving muscle function.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another 2023 study published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9877502/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GeroScience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;journal linked twice-weekly strength training sessions, performed for 12 weeks, to positive effects on cognitive health in adults aged between 60 and 80. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It states: “Findings suggest that resistance training seems to elicit alterations in various neurometabolites that correspond to exercise-induced ‘preservation’ of brain health, while simultaneously having its beneficial effect on augmenting muscle functional characteristics in older adults.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short: it’s good for both your mind and body, helping maintain physical and mental function as you age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 exKmve"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/10/16/56/Progressive-overload-is-the-key-to-successful-strength-training-a-personal-trainer-explains-how-you.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/10/16/56/Progressive-overload-is-the-key-to-successful-strength-training-a-personal-trainer-explains-how-you.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/10/16/56/Progressive-overload-is-the-key-to-successful-strength-training-a-personal-trainer-explains-how-you.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Strength training can be performed in the gym or at home with minimal equipment – as long as you find a way to make it adequately challenging for your fitness levels" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-231525"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Strength training can be performed in the gym or at home with minimal equipment – as long as you find a way to make it adequately challenging for your fitness levels&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty/iStock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/increase-health-benefits-of-walking-b2774984.html"&gt;Four science-backed ways to make your daily walk even better for your health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to start strength training&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever age you are, and whatever age you start, strength training will deliver significant benefits if performed correctly. To illustrate this point, Matranga spins his camera around during our Zoom interview to reveal a woman in her eighties performing textbook Romanian deadlifts in his fitness studio. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s actually unbelievable what she can do – it’s not normal, but it’s normal for us here,” he tells me. “It still blows my mind. We’re seeing all of this research that’s just now coming out, and I think, ‘Hey, if you want samples of well-ageing adults, they’re right here in the gym.’ I feel like the research is starting to echo what I’ve been seeing for a long time, so I really want to encourage more people to start strength training.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than jumping straight into a hardcore training plan, he recommends starting with &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/strength-training-for-beginners-b2792752.html"&gt;one or two full-body sessions per week&lt;/a&gt; – “You’re only going to make progress equal to the amount of work you can recover from, and a new exerciser can’t recover from an advanced routine. We want to start at a level that is appropriate for our fitness level, and it only takes two days a week to change your life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workouts can take as little as 20 minutes and comprise just four moves, Matranga adds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When you’re a novice, you can go into the gym and do a pushing exercise and a pulling exercise [like a chest press and a bent-over row] for your upper body, something like a &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/how-to-squat-correctly-b2606171.html"&gt;squat&lt;/a&gt; for the front of your legs, something like a &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/how-to-deadlift-correctly-b2603126.html"&gt;deadlift&lt;/a&gt; for the back of your legs, and then you can walk away after four exercises having trained every single muscle in your body,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To begin with, you can use the workout below twice per week to work your whole body with just a couple of dumbbells. Practice the exercises without weights at first to reinforce favourable form, then work up to a weight that challenges you when completing the target number of repetitions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wypyku-0 sc-wn0aau-0 lnUWhb kfwxdp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-lq6hxg-0 dxyEsL"&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repetitions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rest between sets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goblet squat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;2-3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;12-15&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;60 seconds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Romanian deadlift&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;2-3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;12-15&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;60 seconds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dumbbell overhead press or press-up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;2-3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;12-15&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;60 seconds &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Single-arm dumbbell row&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;2-3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;12-15&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;60 seconds&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The key pillars of successful strength training&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is helpful to work with a trainer when you first start strength training. This can allow you to perfect your form for each exercise – like any physical activity, lifting weights is a skill that needs to be learned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, there are a few fundamentals that need to be present for this pursuit to be successful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistency: &lt;/strong&gt;The body adheres to the SAID principle, which stands for specific adaptations to imposed demands. Put simply, it adapts to become better at the things we consistently ask it to do. Lifting weights sends a clear signal that we need stronger muscles, bones, ligaments and tendons, among other positive physical adaptations, but it needs to be done regularly to maintain this message. One or two times per week is a good place to start. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge: &lt;/strong&gt;To provide a stimulus sufficient for triggering positive changes, strength training has to be somewhat challenging. After all, if an activity feels easy, why would the body need to adapt when it’s already up to the task? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean you need to lift incredibly heavy weights – “challenging” is a term relative to the individual. Instead, experiment to find exercises, weights and target numbers of repetitions that cause you to feel the “burn” in the target muscle, Matranga advises. Alternatively, you can perform repetitions until your muscles tire to the point that you are forced to involuntarily slow down your movements. Always stop short of the point when your technique breaks down, however. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Progression: &lt;/strong&gt;Doing the same workout, week in, week out, will initially deliver benefits for beginners – because they are new to strength training, they need less stress to trigger adaptations. But progress will soon plateau. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see continued results, &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/home-workout-progressive-overload-b2731044.html"&gt;progressive overload&lt;/a&gt; is needed. This refers to the process of gradually and incrementally increasing the difficulty of your workouts in line with your improving strength and fitness levels. The easiest ways to do this are increasing the weight you’re lifting, upping the repetitions you’re performing per set or raising the number of sets you complete of an exercise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, if the workout above starts to feel easy, the following week you could add a couple of kilograms to the dumbbells, aim for 20 repetitions per set rather than 15, or perform four sets of each exercise rather than three. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1wypyku-0 sc-wn0aau-0 lnUWhb kfwxdp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/fat-loss-advice-ben-carpenter-personal-trainer-b2751663.html"&gt;A personal trainer set out to learn everything he could about fat loss – this was his most important finding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What benefits can you expect to see after a few months of strength training?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The first thing you’re going to notice is improved energy and perception of energy,” says Matranga. “You’re going to feel like you have more juice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You will definitely notice you have more speed, power and balance in your movement too. I’m not saying you will be a freak athlete, but you will be able to get off the sofa easier and walk a little quicker.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the first impacts of strength training that his clients tend to report. They are soon followed by tangible changes to their bodies, both inside and out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“[With an appropriate diet] you might start to &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; changes – typical results with strength training are weight loss, of course, but also changes in muscularity,” Matranga continues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Glutes could be lifted, arms might be more toned or pecs might be firmer – the things a lot of us are looking for aesthetically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Then after a few months, that’s when we can start to see real health improvements like better regulated blood sugar, better regulations of blood lipids, better bone density, better blood pressure and better heart health too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-awdjp1-2 cbpRGD sc-awdjp1-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-awdjp1-0 ewTpmI"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/16/13/16115415-b6dded2d-d35e-4aa8-98bf-06a0e7da68d2.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/16/13/16115415-b6dded2d-d35e-4aa8-98bf-06a0e7da68d2.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/16/13/16115415-b6dded2d-d35e-4aa8-98bf-06a0e7da68d2.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Performed correctly, the squat recruits all major lower body muscles" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-awdjp1-1 bMDiiD" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-231526"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Performed correctly, the squat recruits all major lower body muscles&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Alamy/PA)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/fitness-health-hacks-b2747931.html"&gt;We’ve overcomplicated fitness – these six simple things will make you healthier than most people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Strength training isn’t for me&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matranga says he often experiences pushback from people who are hesitant to start strength training because of its somewhat bullish reputation. However, once they get started, it is the training modality he has “had the best luck getting people to stick with”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Resistance training is so much safer than conventional wisdom has said over the last couple of decades,” he says. “A lot of people think, ‘If I go to the gym and do a deadlift, my back is going to explode, or I can’t do squats because they are bad for my knees’. But if we actually look at the literature, resistance training is really safe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s safer than running [and most sports] because it’s very controlled and rehearsed. There’s no dynamic movement, you’re not on a slippery court or a field, so the injury risk in resistance training is very low.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also says it is a good option for newcomers to exercise. Firstly, because strength lays the foundations for all other forms of exercise – you can’t do any physical activity if your body is not strong enough to tolerate it – and secondly, because it is scalable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can’t do a bench press, you can do a press-up. And if you can’t do a press-up, you can drop your knees to the floor or elevate your hands to make the move more accessible. You can also use resistance machines in gyms to learn the movements behind certain exercises in a more stable environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As with so many exercise modalities, the lowest barrier for entry is actually above most people's capability,” Matranga adds. “I have never met a person who couldn’t do a machine chest press or a cable lat pulldown or an assisted squat, so I really love that resistance training is beginner-friendly and safe, despite what many people think.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-us-premium-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you have any underlying health conditions, it is always worth checking with a medical professional before starting a new exercise plan. But Matranga’s point still stands: strength training is far more accessible than most people realise, and the payout is immense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/strength-training-plan-beginners-calisthenics-b2793975.html"&gt;Everyone is talking about calisthenics – here’s a 4-week strength training plan (no gym membership required)&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2025 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxOcnJoWXBVZ3hRMmp0MG5wNzZLY0gzcEFYLVFvNmJPNlA2Rm00bkdvTU1MRWJ4Z1hlMXdUdTBuV1JIcGxjbnlwUWhNRlBLODM3V0w5ckpaS1JJVHItbndndkY1MkN4OFFBTTNvTXgwZXJMS0R0c04wS2lsOVZFTmxSMU44dmJDdXRqUURhVGJadlNKWFR1WC1IQ3ZB</guid></item><item><title>神经科学家警告，这两种受欢迎的“健康”零食实际上可以增加痴呆症的风险-雅虎主页</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuAFBVV95cUxNdURENlVDZmltaUU3OUlXVWtGSWNiTi0zemxZNEMyeGFZU3JvcUVHN2hGOE5PQ0NSSzdKX0lTdmpiWW5pMXYyV2J6UGRPNDJVaml6VnBhaG5zSVplWmh1Nk9qQWFhUmcycHJyV0h0RlplRDFGVF82bktScEZGRmZCV1ZVX2RoWlNJT3BmNEs2eVoyMW8xdFg4bHhZQjNKZFB0UFloOVNudjBxNlJROW4yUlczUk1XdlAz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/these-snacks-can-increase-dementia-risk-according-to-neuroscientists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:These 2 Popular 'Healthy' Snacks Can Actually Increase Dementia Risk, Neuroscientists Warn;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;These 2 Popular 'Healthy' Snacks Can Actually Increase Dementia Risk, Neuroscientists Warn&lt;/a&gt; originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://parade.com" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Parade;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Parade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While meals are often planned out (to avoid the inevitable “what’s for dinner?” inquiries), snacks tend to be an in-the-moment decision. But just like at meal time, everything you eat or drink impacts the body for better or for worse, including the &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1186194/kaitlin-vogel/brain-foods/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:brain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That makes the ready-to-eat snacks you keep on hand extra important. Think about what’s in your pantry and fridge right now that are your household’s most popular snacks. Even if you make most of your meals using nutrient-rich, whole food ingredients, many people rely on processed, packaged foods for snacks because they’re quick and easy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not all processed foods are unhealthy; &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/best-packaged-foods-for-heart-health-according-to-cardiologist" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:some are good for you;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;some are good for you&lt;/a&gt;.

When eaten regularly, they can disrupt the way your brain functions and increase the risk for mental and cognitive health problems over time,” he explains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before you freak out too much, Dr. Maniscalco says that when only eaten occasionally, these snacks are nothing to worry about. But if added sugar-filled granola bars or flavored yogurt are part of your daily routine, he says that over time they can increase the risk of dementia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/brain-health-red-flag-in-shower" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Brain Health Red Flag That Shows Up In the Shower;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The Brain Health Red Flag That Shows Up In the Shower &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.drfayebegeti.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Faye Begeti, PhD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. Faye Begeti, PhD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; a neuroscientist and author of &lt;em&gt;The Phone Fix&lt;/em&gt;, also says that ultra-processed foods—which can include granola bars and flavored yogurt—are detrimental to brain health long-term. “Ultra-processed foods tend to be high in refined sugars and unhealthy fats and typically lack essential nutrients our brains need. Regularly consuming these foods can negatively affect blood sugar control and increase inflammation, both of which are linked to impaired cognitive function, memory issues and a higher risk of dementia later in life,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Dr. Maniscalco adds to this, saying, “Inflammation doesn’t just affect your joints or your gut; it affects your brain too. Inflammatory chemicals can interfere with how your brain cells communicate, making it harder to focus, regulate emotions and stay mentally sharp.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37831127/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Scientific research backs this up,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Scientific research backs this up,&lt;/a&gt; showing that regularly consuming ultra-processed foods is linked to a higher risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/worst-food-for-brain-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Brain Health Experts Agree That This Is the Absolute Worst Food for Your Mind;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Brain Health Experts Agree That This Is the Absolute Worst Food for Your Mind&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Granola bars and flavored yogurt aren’t the only “healthy” snacks where added sugar can be found. Neurologist and author &lt;a href="https://drperlmutter.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. David Perlmutter, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. David Perlmutter, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, says that orange juice often contains more sugar than many people realize. “We often think a glass of orange juice is a healthy way to start the day, but a 12-ounce serving contains an astounding 31 to 39 grams of sugar, comparable to or even exceeding the sugar in a 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola, which has about 39 grams,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Though orange juice has vitamin C, Dr. Perlmutter says that the high sugar content outweighs this benefit. “It causes a rapid blood sugar spike, triggering insulin release and promoting fat storage and inflammation,” he explains. A healthier way to get your vitamin C? Have an orange. That way, you get the added benefit of fiber and don’t get the added sugar that juices contain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/best-food-for-brain-health-according-to-a-neurologist" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:If You Want to Improve Your Brain Health, This Is the Very Best Food You Can Eat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;If You Want to Improve Your Brain Health, This Is the Very Best Food You Can Eat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Brain-Healthy Snacks To Have Instead&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;It bears repeating that not all processed snacks are unhealthy. Consider this yet another reminder to check the nutritional panel and ingredients list when shopping for snacks. If you want a snack that lowers your risk of dementia instead of increasing it, Dr. Begeti says to choose something high in omega-3 fatty acids. This can include a handful of nuts, edamame or smoked salmon on toast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Maniscalco says that foods high in antioxidants and fiber support short-term and long-term brain health too. Some examples of this include trail mix containing &lt;a href="https://parade.com/health/best-berry-for-heart-health-according-to-cardiologists" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:berries;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;berries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://parade.com/1352061/alexandramallon/types-of-nuts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:nuts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;nuts&lt;/a&gt;, hummus and veggies and&lt;a href="https://parade.com/1115442/parade/avocado-recipes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:avocado;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt; avocado&lt;/a&gt; on whole grain toast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Transitioning from eating sugar-filled processed snacks to nutrient-rich snacks can be challenging at first, but Maniscalco says it gets easier over time. “One of the biggest barriers to switching from ultra-processed snacks to whole-food alternatives is taste. Hyperpalatable foods overstimulate your taste receptors and reward pathways, essentially desensitizing you to natural flavors. As a result, whole foods may initially taste bland or ‘off.’ But the good news is that your taste buds regenerate every one to two weeks, and your brain adapts too. After even 10 to 14 days of reduced added sugar and processed flavoring, most people report that fruit tastes sweeter, vegetables are more satisfying and cravings diminish. In other words, whole foods start tasting really good—you just need to give your brain and palate time to adjust,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Making the switch from snacks full of added sugar to ones containing nutrients like omega-3s, fiber and antioxidants will benefit your brain both in the short term and the long term.

			&lt;p&gt;You need fibre. That much is true. But in the world of online health trends, what started out as sound dietary advice has spiralled into &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/popular-fibermaxxing-diet-trend-not-right-everyone-nutritionist-says"&gt;"fibremaxxing"&lt;/a&gt; – a push to consume eye-watering amounts in the name of wellness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the UK, NHS guidelines suggest that an adult should consume at least &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0260106018794558?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed"&gt;30g of fibre a day&lt;/a&gt;. Children and teens typically &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26495121/"&gt;need much less&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet despite clear guidelines, most Britons fall short of their daily fibre target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One major culprit? The rise of ultra-processed foods, or UPFs. UK adults now get over &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7194406/"&gt;54% of their daily calories&lt;/a&gt; from ultra-processed foods. For teenagers, it's &lt;a href="https://www.nihr.ac.uk/news/nihr-study-finds-ultra-processed-food-makes-almost-two-thirds-calorie-intake-uk-adolescents"&gt;nearer 66%&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/eating-fiber-could-protect-you-from-infections-heres-why?utm_source=SA_article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=related_link"&gt;Eating Fiber Could Protect You From Infections. Here's Why.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This matters because UPFs are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10260459/"&gt;typically&lt;/a&gt; low in fibre and micronutrients, while being high in sugar, salt and unhealthy fats. When these foods dominate our plate, naturally fibre-rich whole foods get pushed out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies show that as ultra-processed food intake increases, fibre consumption &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8538030/"&gt;decreases&lt;/a&gt;, along with other essential nutrients. The result is a population falling well short of its daily fibre target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dietary fibre is &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/DA18E6ABBC51876FD0B61C8D9D4ADF04/S2048679025000060a.pdf/dietary-fibre-intake-in-the-adult-swiss-population-a-comprehensive-analysis-of-timing-and-sources.pdf"&gt;essential for good health&lt;/a&gt; as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/how-to-eat-a-balanced-diet/eating-a-balanced-diet/#:%7E:text=eat%20at%20least%205%20portions,to%208%20glasses%20a%20day"&gt;balanced diet&lt;/a&gt;. And it is best found in &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/12/10/3209"&gt;natural plant-based&lt;/a&gt; foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding high fibre foods to your meals and snacks throughout a typical day, such as switching to wholegrain bread for breakfast, keeping the skin on fruits like an apple, adding lentils and onions to a chilli evening meal and eating a handful of pumpkin seeds or Brazil nuts between meals, would help an average person hit their 30g-a-day dietary requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169557" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169557" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/skin_on_apple_642.jpg" alt="man eating apple" class="wp-image-169557 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/skin_on_apple_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/skin_on_apple_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169557" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;You can get plenty of fiber by leaving the skin on your apple. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAC88vh81Q4/"&gt;nebari/Getty Images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Displacement&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With fibremaxxing, what might make this trend somewhat dangerous is the removal of other food groups such as proteins, carbohydrates and fats and replacing them with &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/side-effects/nutrition/high-fiber-foods"&gt;fibre-dense foods&lt;/a&gt;, supplements or powder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where the potential risk could mitigate the benefits of increasing fibre, as no robust studies in humans – as far as I'm aware – have been conducted on long-term fibre intakes over 40g a day. (Some advocates of fibremaxxing suggest consuming between &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/diet-nutrition/a65049070/what-is-fibermaxxing/"&gt;50 and 100g a day&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eating too much fibre too quickly – especially without &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jhn.12589"&gt;enough water&lt;/a&gt; – can lead to bloating, cramping and constipation. It can also cause a buildup of gas that can escape at the most inconvenient moments, like during a daily commute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_169558" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169558" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/man_farting_642.jpg" alt="friends of guilty-looking man pulling faces of disgust" class="wp-image-169558 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/man_farting_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/07/man_farting_642-600x327.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-169558" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Someone's been fibremaxxing. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAEUveViN3Y/"&gt;Anton Estrada/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rapidly increasing fibre intake or consuming too much can interfere with the absorption of essential micronutrients like &lt;a href="https://aspenjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1177/0884533610385707"&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;, which supports normal body function, as well as macronutrients, which provide the energy needed for movement, repair and adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it's important to remember that increasing fibre in your diet offers a wide range of health benefits. It supports a healthy digestive system by promoting regular bowel movements and reducing the occurrence of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4716043/"&gt;inflammatory bowel disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soluble fibre helps to regulate blood sugar levels by slowing the absorption of glucose, making it especially helpful for people at risk of type 2  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="169551" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. It also lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol, reducing the risk of heart disease. Fibre keeps you feeling full for longer, which supports healthy weight management and appetite regulation. These findings are all &lt;a href="https://www.jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(16)31187-X/fulltext"&gt;well documented&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a high-fibre diet has been linked to a lower risk of certain cancers, particularly &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27848961/"&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;, by helping to remove toxins efficiently from the body. Gradually increasing fibre intake to recommended levels – through a balanced, varied diet – can offer real health benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the evidence, it's clear that many of us could benefit from eating more fibre – but within reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until we know more, it's safest to stick to fibre intake within current guidelines, and get it from natural sources rather than powders or supplements. Fibre is vital, but more isn't always better. Skip the social media fads and aim for balance: whole grains, veg, nuts and seeds. Your gut – and your fellow commuters – will thank you.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/261280/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

Using the PREVENT Heart Age Calculator developed by researchers at Northwestern Medicine, scientists found that the average heart age is 4 to 7 years older than a person’s actual calendar age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does that mean? This means that even in your 40s or 50s, your heart could be aging like it's in its 60s or 70s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The silver lining amidst this troubling news? Cardiologists say your heart age is not fixed. By adopting a few evidence-based lifestyle habits, you can turn back the clock naturally and powerfully.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why most American hearts are aging too fast&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a large-scale study analyzing over 14,000 US adults aged 30 to 79, the average heart age for men was 56.7, despite their average chronological age being just 49.7. For women, the average heart age clocked in at 55.4, with an actual average age of 51.3. That’s a 7-year and 4-year gap, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some cases, especially among men from Black and Hispanic communities, the heart was found to be 8 to 9 years older than the person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;What’s driving this &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;premature heart aging&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The contributing factors are familiar: high blood pressure, poor diet, inactivity, obesity, smoking, diabetes, and chronic stress. But while these factors are widespread, they are also largely manageable, with some simple yet effective changes in habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7 &lt;keyword id="28125998" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="simple-habits-to-keep-your-heart-young" source="Orion"&gt;simple habits to keep your heart young&lt;/keyword&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need a gym membership, a strict diet, or expensive supplements to start rejuvenating your heart. Here are 7 expert-approved, research-backed habits that can help:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Eat mindfully&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your eating pattern is one of the most defining and deciding factors when it comes to health, especially your heart health. What goes in the stomach often leaves a lasting effect on the heart. Make sure the effect is a good one. Embrace the Mediterranean diet, rich in vegetables, whole grains, nuts, lean protein, and healthy fats like olive oil. Limit ultra-processed foods, sugar, and sodium. And yes, swear off those nasty bits of junk food!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Pro tip:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Swap red meat for salmon or beans twice a week for better heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Move your body (every step counts)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more mobile you are, the better your heart health is. No matter what age you’re at, keep yourself active. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise weekly. If you calculate, that’s just 30 minutes, 5 days a week. Walking, swimming, cycling, or dancing can lower blood pressure, improve cholesterol, and boost circulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Pro tip:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Take walking meetings, use stairs, or stretch during screen breaks. Every step counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="54"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Prioritize sleep quality&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, you’re not being lazy or making excuses to hit the bed. Rest isn’t reward, it’s a necessity. Poor sleep is linked to higher risks of hypertension, obesity, and heart failure. Adults should get 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Pro tip:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Power down screens an hour before bed and aim for a consistent bedtime, even on weekends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Manage stress (before it manages you)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress elevates cortisol and blood pressure, damaging arteries over time. Stress can also lead to poor sleep habits, which eventually catalyze the risk of heart disease. Try meditation, deep breathing, journaling, or even a walk outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Pro tip:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just 10 minutes of daily mindfulness can lower your heart rate and reduce anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="73"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Quit smoking&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smoking is one of the most significant accelerators of heart aging. It’s not cool; in fact, the long-term effects of smoking can be extremely cruel. Even secondhand smoke increases risk.

As Dr. Sadiya Khan, a cardiologist and lead researcher of the study, explained, “Telling someone they have a 7% risk of a heart attack in 10 years doesn’t land the same way as saying their heart is aging 10 years faster than they are.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="108"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach may encourage earlier intervention, particularly in people under 50 who often think heart disease is a concern for “older” adults. But the truth is, heart disease remains the leading cause of death in the US, and it begins silently, long before symptoms appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="110"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="112"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, despite the grim reality, the encouraging truth is that heart aging isn’t inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="114"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;With consistent, small lifestyle changes, you can lower your heart age, reduce your risk of heart attack and stroke, and improve the quality of your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="117"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's never too early or too late to start. Whether you're 30 or 70, your heart responds to positive changes, often within weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="119"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if your heart feels older than you are, take that as a wake-up call, not a life sentence. Incorporate these simple habits into your daily routine, and your heart may thank you with many more vibrant, active years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="121"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Meet Kobe, the toddler chef who's winning hearts in the internet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="123"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2025 01:21:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>根据胃肠病学家的说法，您应该服用5种补充剂来缓解便秘- EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxQREdYbjJTSHlEOTZrZVZaU0pCUDAxRFJkSXVkMFJ4TkxrdE9uTFhHYmxvbEphcEhKWl9oR3BTNnBtV1pJU3dOQXh6X2gxZUtEMWlnRXVPN2Z0cWNkY0VRaWdaVXk3c0dHZVp1ak5FbGp0d2s2b25ZYmJaQlpVazhQbWRZRElObERVcEE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A healthy diet and hydration should be your first defense against constipation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When these aren’t enough, certain supplements can provide safe, effective relief.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A gastroenterologist recommends psyllium, probiotics, magnesium and polyethylene glycol.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Constipation isn’t anyone’s ideal state of digestive affairs. The bloating, distension and overall discomfort of a gastrointestinal slowdown are a combo you’d probably prefer to skip. But for most of us, being backed up is an occasional fact of life (sometimes even a chronic one). Constipation is so common, in fact, that about 16% of U.S. adults say it’s a problem.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Fortunately, certain dietary supplements can help get things moving again. Though they may not work immediately, with a little patience, the right choices may make you feel lighter and brighter sooner than later. We tapped&lt;a href="https://atlanticcoastgastro.com/physicians/sandhya-shukla-md/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Sandhya Shukla, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified gastroenterologist with Atlantic Coast Gastroenterology, a division of Allied Digestive Health, for her top supplement recommendations for constipation. She says the following five are worth a try.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-psyllium-husk"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Psyllium Husk &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; With its surging popularity on social media, psyllium husk may seem like a buzzy modern supplement. But it’s been used in Ayurvedic medicine as a natural remedy for constipation for thousands of years. What makes it so effective? Psyllium husk is rich in soluble fiber, which creates a slick, gel-like substance in the digestive tract that retains water. This, in turn, makes your poops easier to pass, Shukla says.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Besides psyllium’s ability to hold water, research reveals that it may also get things going by positively impacting &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/how-your-gut-health-impacts-your-body-8695122" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut microbiota&lt;/a&gt;. Those are the trillions of bacteria that regulate a healthy digestive tract. For instance, one small study found that supplementing with psyllium husk for four weeks led to beneficial changes in the gut microbiota of people with constipation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And another older study reported similar improvements in as little as one week.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Just note that psyllium husk can cause side effects in some people. (Shukla says a feeling of bloating is especially common.) You may want to start with a small dose to test your tolerance gradually. Also good to know: while supplements containing insoluble fiber may claim to ease constipation, they can actually make things worse. So, stick with soluble fiber-containing psyllium instead.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-probiotics"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Probiotics &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By now, you’ve probably heard of &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8037462/benefits-of-taking-probiotics/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;probiotics&lt;/a&gt;. These beneficial, live bacteria may be an inexpensive, over-the-counter means of maintaining a happy gut. Here’s a tip, though: don’t just choose any old strain you see. Current research shows that certain probiotic strains may be more helpful than others for specific health issues, including constipation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One that has a solid track record is&lt;em&gt; Lactobacillus reuteri.&lt;/em&gt; It works by getting your gut moving, helping you go more often.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; So, look for this strain specifically, or ask your doctor if another strain might be right for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-magnesium-oxide"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Magnesium Oxide &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-benefits-8656021" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Magnesium&lt;/a&gt; is often touted as a constipation preventer. However, with so many forms of this mineral on supplement shelves, it can be hard to distinguish which one is best. Shukla recommends magnesium oxide. Like psyllium husk, she says magnesium oxide draws more water into the stool, keeping things nice and soft to help with easier evacuation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This form of magnesium may be particularly useful for treating chronic constipation that doesn’t have a known cause (also known as idiopathic constipation). In fact, the American Gastroenterological Association and American College of Gastroenterology recently released new guidelines recommending magnesium oxide as a pharmacological treatment for idiopathic constipation.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; But don’t be put off by the “pharmacological” terminology—magnesium oxide is available over the counter.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Shukla says you can find magnesium oxide in different strengths. “I usually recommend starting at 200 or 250 milligrams [per day] and increasing to a maximum of 1,000 milligrams per day.” She also notes that people with decreased kidney function should avoid taking magnesium, as it can build to dangerous levels if the kidneys are unable to filter it properly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-polyethylene-glycol"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Polyethylene Glycol &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Never heard of polyethylene glycol? You may have seen it in dietary supplements without realizing it’s there. This compound is the active ingredient in powdered supplements like MiraLax and its generic equivalents.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Shukla recommends polyethylene glycol for its ease of use and effectiveness in alleviating constipation. “It is tasteless and odorless and therefore well tolerated,” she says. “Its absorption from the gut is negligible, making it a safe and effective option for treating constipation.” And unlike over-the-counter laxatives that should only be used occasionally, it’s safe for longer-term use. For instance, one study found that polyethylene glycol was safe and effective in reducing the frequency of hard or lumpy stools in people with chronic idiopathic constipation over the course of 24 weeks.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-prunes--prune-juice"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Prunes &amp;amp; Prune Juice &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Turns out, Grandma was onto something. While not a supplement per se, the old &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-best-late-night-drink-to-help-you-poop-8649695" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;prune juice remedy&lt;/a&gt; really is a smart move for getting regular again. And there’s research to prove it. For instance, one study found that people with chronic constipation who drank slightly less than 2 ounces of prune juice daily for eight weeks experienced significantly fewer hard or lumpy stools.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; That makes it food as medicine for the win!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Prunes have high dietary fiber and sorbitol, both helpful for treating constipation,” explains Shukla. “This contributes to increased stool bulk and improved bowel movements.” Just ¼ cup of prunes (about 5 prunes) provides 3 grams of fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  Sorbitol, on the other hand, is a naturally occurring sugar alcohol that offers some surprising benefits for digestive health. “Sorbitol has osmotic properties that draw water into the intestines, keeping stool soft and easy to expel,” says Shukla. In fact, some people with quick intestinal transit actually &lt;em&gt;avoid&lt;/em&gt; sorbitol for this reason. So, if you want to give prunes or prune juice a try, start slowly.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When your digestive tract gets a bit sluggish, a healthy diet, proper hydration and exercise should be your first lines of defense. When they aren’t enough, the supplement aisle has safe, effective options for constipation relief. Psyllium husk, probiotics, magnesium oxide and polyethylene glycol are all gastroenterologist-approved supplements for constipation relief. And if you’d prefer a more natural remedy, give prunes or prune juice a try. They may not be trendy, but they work!&lt;br&gt;
