But the scale of the outbreak in Ontario could overturn that achievement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Since October, Canada’s most populous province has reported more than 2,000 cases – more than all of those in the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;United States combined in 2025&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Public health figures show cases continue to climb despite efforts to quell the rise. Last week, the outbreak reached a grim milestone after the province recorded its first fatality. Moore told the media a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/05/canada-premature-infant-measles-death" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;premature baby, who contracted measles in utero&lt;/a&gt;, died from medical complications, including the presence of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It’s only a very small subgroup of people who have chosen not to get vaccinated who are having the complications,” he said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;While the vaccine is not recommended once a person is pregnant – in part because it contains a live virus that could be passed on to the fetus – public health groups recommend unvaccinated pregnant people get one dose of intravenous immunoglobulin if they are exposed to measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Some people, if they don’t want a vaccine, they may not want the immunoglobulin either. That may be a philosophical choice,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Moore said that Canada’s high levels of vaccination had nonetheless blunted what could be a far worse outbreak, giving large swaths of the population protection against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I know some will concentrate on the glass being half-empty. You know, to have that level of protection in the face of the risks globally, I think is quite an accomplishment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 15:41:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMigwFBVV95cUxONWp3NmhKaXJGNU96REFORWtORTU0MDAtT0JBakVoX3d1RlVMZzV0REhKMk1iYzF4dHoyNU15NmNZRWV6X3JYQWR6aDZSTlpYNS05ejZrUlFJV282ZVJrbmZsbzE4ZzIyVmZuMkdwRjFZOXA2TmUyeXFEeG1QT2F4bmt5Zw</guid></item><item><title>可怕的地图揭示了会让你考虑搬家的痴呆集群-每日邮报 | Terrifying map reveals dementia clusters that'll make you consider moving - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiogFBVV95cUxOTmdvWkZyd1ZNVllNaERCZVdKSmU1cVVVc0d5c21YekVwTzlVUmt0U3NsSmRmRF9TLVpVYXRIZm03dU9LVjZmbjRUcUd2c2V4TGdUTWFjME5qeVJjZ1NFWk9aWTZ6MmlBN2hWMkZsVG9PakR2T04yVGZFMzkxWmpMRUlSaUczb0FJUlNrazFoQjUwOTBPRWU3OVhyNG9talFCV0HSAacBQVVfeXFMUHZLVVJNZi1TaU1qb1EtNkZxOHRRN280cHhZZHdPX1ZjbnE3Y3RRSjFoLWd0dFhsWFRxbFh1LXRkbWkzWms4TTU5amxYZTM4Q05kNHFhRnF6amZPcjNVQ1NvNHY5SFBsMENYTTBydmUtaEVUakxESDU3Vnc0Z3JtQXBjZUg2SW5BNnc4NWxVYzdtWjBKSXlzYU9abk9NNjc2bzliQndvRkU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People living in the Rocky Mountains and Northwest US are among those with the highest risk of dementia, a study suggests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers in California split the US into 10 regions and compared dementia rates in each. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They used the Mid-Atlantic region, which includes states like &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pennsylvania/index.html" id="mol-ca463c40-4531-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179" class=""&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new-jersey/index.html" id="mol-ca45ee20-4531-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt; and West &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/virginia/index.html" id="mol-ca46d880-4531-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179" class=""&gt;Virginia&lt;/a&gt;, as a baseline for comparison because it had the lowest rates overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results revealed people living in the Southeast - &lt;span&gt;which includes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/kentucky/index.html" id="mol-5f0d2890-4530-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179"&gt;Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/tennessee/index.html" id="mol-ca46b170-4531-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179"&gt;Tennessee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alabama/index.html" id="mol-5f0d2891-4530-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179"&gt;Alabama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/mississippi/index.html" id="mol-5f0d2892-4530-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179" class=""&gt;Mississippi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; - were most likely to get dementia with a 25 percent increased risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;They were followed closely by northwest states like &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/alaska/index.html" id="mol-e5cd91c0-4545-11f0-9614-91a63a3ab054"&gt;Alaska&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/idaho/index.html" id="mol-e5cd91c1-4545-11f0-9614-91a63a3ab054"&gt;Idaho&lt;/a&gt; and around the Rocky Mountains were at a 23 percent increased risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Southwestern states like &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-e5cd91c2-4545-11f0-9614-91a63a3ab054"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; were 13 percent more likely to develop the condition, meanwhile those in northeast states like New York were the least likely - a seven percent increased risk.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers, from the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), said the disparities are most likely due to socioeconomic factors like quality of education and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/sciencetech/article-14719863/Scientists-discover-toxic-substance-hiding-100-peoples-brains-explains-rise-dementia-US.html"&gt;exposure to environmental toxins&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They said while more research is needed, the findings show which areas of the country are most vulnerable to dementia and where efforts should be targeted for education, prevention and therapies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Wendy Williams, pictured here, is one of the most famous faces of dementia. She was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in 2023 at age 59&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The above map published in JAMA Neurology shows dementia risk divided by geographic region. The Southeast was at the greatest risk while Mid-Atlantic was the lowest &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Kristine Yaffe, senior study author, said: 'The study underscores the need to understand regional differences in dementia and the importance of region-specific prevention and intervention efforts.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 8million adults in the US have some form of dementia and 500,000 are diagnosed every year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts estimate cases will &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14279053/Americans-dementia-disease-underestimated.html"&gt;grow by 1million per year by 2060&lt;/a&gt;, while some research suggests 12.7million patients could be diagnosed by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This could be due to cases being underreported, a growing aging population and surging rates of diseases like heart disease and obesity, which can weaken blood vessels in the brain and lead to dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's is the most common form with about 6million cases. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The new study, published Monday in &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://media.jamanetwork.com/embargoed-articles/?_articles=27d58547f7#"&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/a&gt;, evaluated records from 1.2million veterans over 65 who sought care at a Veterans Affairs (VA) health system between 1999 and 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers used VA data to compare dementia rates among veterans in 10 regions in the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On average, participants were followed for 13 years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average participant age was 74, and 98 percent were men. About 86 percent were white. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average age of dementia diagnosis overall in the US is 83. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team divided participants by 10 geographic regions defined by the CDC: the Northeast, Great Lakes, Mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic, Southeast, South, Midwest, Rocky Mountains, Southwest and Northwest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Mid-Atlantic - which includes &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/delaware/index.html" id="mol-3f3777d1-452d-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179" class=""&gt;Delaware&lt;/a&gt;, Washington &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/washington-dc/index.html" id="mol-3f3777d0-452d-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179"&gt;DC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/maryland/index.html" id="mol-3f38b050-452d-11f0-be51-9bea23f7c179"&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, New Jersey - was used as a baseline because it had the lowest dementia rate of 11 per 1,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers found 14 in every 1,000 participants in the Southeast had dementia, a 25 percent increased risk over the Mid-Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Northwest - Alaska, Idaho, Oregon and Washington state - and Rocky Mountain - Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah and Wyoming - both had dementia rates of 13 per 1,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This put those areas at a 23 percent increased risk over the Mid-Atlantic.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;People living in Arizona, California, Hawaii and Nevada - the Southwest region - were at a 13 percent increased risk, with a rate of 12 per 1,000. The Midwest and Great Lakes regions were also around 13 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Northeast region had the smallest increase compared to the Mid-Atlantic with a dementia rate of 12 per 1,000 people and a seven percent greater risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers pointed to socioeconomic factors influencing regional risks, especially in southeastern states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Christina Dintica, first study author and postdoctoral scholar of psychiatry at UCSF, said: 'Quality of education, early life conditions, and environmental exposures may be among those factors.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;States like Kentucky and Mississippi also have high rates of conditions like diabetes, heart disease and obesity, all of which can damage blood vessels in the brain and trigger full-body inflammation that can kill brain cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also have high concentrations of industrial factories releasing chemicals like heavy metals and gases linked to dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Military veterans in general are also at a higher risk of dementia overall due to higher rates of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), which can damage brain cells and blood vessels in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some TBIs may also increase amounts of tau and amyloid proteins in the brain, which are known to cause Alzheimer's disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is also most common in veterans. The condition is thought to trigger inflammation in the brain and damage the brain's memory structures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Veterans over 70, such as those in the study, were also more likely to have been exposed to Agent Orange, a mixture of herbicides used by the US military during the Vietnam War. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Previous research suggests people exposed to Agent Orange were twice as likely to develop dementia as those who were not exposed due to inflammation and brain cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study had several limitations, including only focusing on veterans and the vast majority of participants being men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 15:28:05 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiogFBVV95cUxOTmdvWkZyd1ZNVllNaERCZVdKSmU1cVVVc0d5c21YekVwTzlVUmt0U3NsSmRmRF9TLVpVYXRIZm03dU9LVjZmbjRUcUd2c2V4TGdUTWFjME5qeVJjZ1NFWk9aWTZ6MmlBN2hWMkZsVG9PakR2T04yVGZFMzkxWmpMRUlSaUczb0FJUlNrazFoQjUwOTBPRWU3OVhyNG9talFCV0HSAacBQVVfeXFMUHZLVVJNZi1TaU1qb1EtNkZxOHRRN280cHhZZHdPX1ZjbnE3Y3RRSjFoLWd0dFhsWFRxbFh1LXRkbWkzWms4TTU5amxYZTM4Q05kNHFhRnF6amZPcjNVQ1NvNHY5SFBsMENYTTBydmUtaEVUakxESDU3Vnc0Z3JtQXBjZUg2SW5BNnc4NWxVYzdtWjBKSXlzYU9abk9NNjc2bzliQndvRkU</guid></item><item><title>数百名医生无法治愈我的偏头痛和失眠十年。但只需要一颗奇迹药丸--《每日邮报》 | HUNDREDS of doctors couldn't cure my migraines and insomnia for ten years.

The healthcare system failed me.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Determined to improve his health and frustrated by how long it had taken to get a diagnosis, Marchione co-founded Superpower in 2022, a healthcare startup that analyzes 100 blood biomarkers, including cholesterol, heavy metals, the stress hormone cortisol and sex hormones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More testing done in 2024 using Superpower revealed even scarier health implications. Marchione had the toxins mercury and BPA in his body at levels higher than 99 percent of the US population. And doctors told him he had likely been unknowingly battling these toxins since he was 12. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Max Marchione (pictured here), 25, spent a decade searching for answers behind his insomnia and migraines. He told Daily Mail it took a year to reverse all of his conditions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marchione, originally from Australia and now living in San Francisco, said: 'I tried to take things into my own hands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's a big gap between the best care and what most people have access to. How do you close that gap?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Everyone needs access to the best care.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For Marchione, Superpower suggested he take 400 milligrams of thiamine pills, also known as vitamin B1, an essential vitamin that turns carbs into energy and promotes healthy nerve function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The body can't make vitamin B1 on its own, but it's found in pork, nuts, eggs, trout, black beans, whole grains, kale and cauliflower. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Low levels of thiamine can lead to severe nervous and cardiovascular system dysfunction, including confusion, memory problems, heart failure, brain swelling, nerve damage and balance issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The average American needs just one to 1.5 milligrams per day, but research suggests supplementing between 100 and 300 milligrams could help improve prediabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One study in the &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23715873/"&gt;European Journal of Nutrition&lt;/a&gt; found patients with prediabetes who took 300 milligrams of thiamine daily for six weeks had 11 percent lower glucose levels than those who didn't supplement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marchione claims taking 400 milligrams of thiamine every day reversed his prediabetes in three months. Dr Erika Schwartz, a preventative health expert and founder of Vault Science, told the Daily Mail: 'Taking 400 mg of vitamin B1 daily is considered a high dose, but it’s generally safe since any excess is flushed out in urine.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The supplements have now allowed Marchione to occasionally enjoy carb-heavy foods like pasta or pizza without suffering glucose spikes, fatigue or digestive symptoms, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told this website: 'When I had carbs, they didn't really affect me. But if I went off the vitamin B1, I'd have brain fog and bloating.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Schwartz said: 'To truly move the needle, vitamin B1 needs to be paired with a healthy, whole-food diet, balanced hormones, and regular exercise. These lifestyle factors are the real drivers of insulin sensitivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Thiamine can support the process — think of it like giving your body better tools to do its job — but it can’t replace the job itself. If you’re eating poorly, staying sedentary, and stressed out, no vitamin will fix that alone.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt; BPA is relatively common in food packaging, cans, and plastic containers despite the well-established deleterious effects that has on the human body, such as infertility certain cancers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Canned foods are responsible for 6.6 micrograms per person per day of BPA exposure. When when inside of the cans contain a BPA coating, the harmful chemical seeps into the food itself&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Superpower also told him to cut out canned foods from his diet, like soup, fish and vegetable oil, as well as some cheeses and sauces, to lower his levels of toxins and heavy metals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This meant cutting out canned sauces, soups and fish and trying to opt for more minimally processed, whole foods like fruits, vegetables and lean proteins. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;BPA, Bisphenol A, is an industrial chemical used in hard plastics and resins to make them more durable. It typically lines plastic and metal food containers and leeches into food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research suggests BPA acts as an 'endocrine disruptor,' meaning it can imitate the body's hormones and interfere with the production of and response to natural hormones like estrogen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This leads to hormonal imbalances linked to early puberty, infertility and some reproductive cancers like ovarian cancer, as well as migraines like Marchione's.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mercury is a heavy metal that gets deposited in the water and accumulates in fish like swordfish, king mackerel and albacore tuna. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There is no 'safe' level of mercury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Watchdog group Environmental Working Group estimates 16,000 foods in the US have BPA in their packaging, and nearly all fish and shellfish have traces of mercury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Thiamine, also called vitamin B1, is thought to help lower blood glucose levels and stave off type 2 diabetes (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Marchione is pictured at left with the other co-founders of Superpower. The membership costs $499 and combines biomarker testing with AI-based solutions &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, high mercury can lead to headaches and insomnia, similar to what Marchione experienced, due to it attacking the central nervous system and damaging brain cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marchione told the Daily Mail his lifestyle changes &lt;span&gt;reversed all of his symptoms within a year and slashed his biological age from 35 to 20 - five years younger than his chronological age. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Marchione estimates it took six months to a year to bring his levels back down to a normal range. Once they returned, his debilitating symptoms disappeared and he no longer was prediabetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since reversing prediabetes, insomnia, migraines and high toxin levels, Marchione 'never gets sick.' He's now focusing on growing Superpower, which has 200,000 people on a waitlist, and making comprehensive biomarker testing more affordable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'Cancer at 50 starts when you're 20.

at least once a week, with there being a direct correlation with happiness, according to participants in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Alexandra Janssen, a researcher at the University of Manchester, is the author behind the recent study and she pointed out the importance of regular sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;The study found that women who were getting intimate more often, were happier (Getty Stock Image)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It was found that 85 percent of women who had sex every week were 'sexually satisfied', said the survey, which accumulated the results from almost 500 heterosexual women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;However, of &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/weddings"&gt;wives&lt;/a&gt; and girlfriends who did the dirty just once a month, only 66 percent were as happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;While it's not a huge drop-off, it's noticeable enough to take some notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;If we go on to women who had sex less than once a month, the satisfaction level dropped to a dangerously low 17 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Speaking &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/35297660/women-sex-happiest-health/"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; The Sun, Janssen pointed out that those having intercourse less often than once a week were 'less likely to be satisfied in their sexual relationships'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"Therapists working with women to improve their sexual relationship satisfaction might focus on increasing the frequency of sex," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Moving onto other findings, it was noted that women who ranked sex as 'very important' had better love lives than those that didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Janssen added that the low-rated importance of sex might be a 'coping strategy' from those who aren't doing the deed as often as they'd want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;Getting intimate once a week should be the goal (Getty Stock Image)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Women over the age of 45 were also the least likely to report happiness when it came to intimacy in their relationships, while satisfaction was higher with women who reported more regular orgasms and placed an importance on sex in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Coincidence? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;483 women from New Zealand were surveyed for the 2024 study, with all of them being in a committed relationship in the past year or so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;When it came to limitations, authors acknowledged that there was no way to verify if the answers were real, given that it was a survey. In addition, diversity wasn't a strong point of the study, limiting the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;In the &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/uk-news"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, it is said via YouGov that six in 10 Brits get between the sheets less than once a week, while just one in 10 say to have sex weekly, and just 15 percent say that they are intimate more often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;According to all the scientific findings then, it seems that more is better!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>LADbible</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 14:58:13 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxPQmMyWkxzaWkxUVFfSzdJd2FDU0tiUGozOU8tS0FndzdIXzNLc09wLW1XZ09Lcm0yYl9ZOHhFckFlU2F5cV9TQVFnQ1ZXa2dhc3N0XzJvT2NtVEp5V1cwZUlqa2xpYzBEb3F2WkFKQWlNeUFiUDhabURzbTlldnBKbTE2VVh1U3NpVjJNWFdDWHRJOFEwcTlCcW5ORi1UaXUzX1hpQmFtVGM5UzlxSlQw</guid></item><item><title>屏幕时间噩梦： “数字奶嘴”如何吮吸儿童的理智-研究发现 | Screen Time Nightmare: How ‘Digital Pacifiers’ Are Sucking The Sanity Out Of Children - Study Finds</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifEFVX3lxTFBSY0JzS1YwTVFsdXhwUWNCYWl4b3h6ZmRMQWljejZHVE9fZWIxTW51cXU3d2JWLXd6M3VDUUZ1NXBKMVFXNEJ2V0hvYVd5a2hEY0JsVDEyMlZGczlBS0MzZjl2RFNlMFJqRkxxR212YVBmakpIX1VZb1hJU0M?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt;&lt;div class="post-featured-image"&gt;&lt;img src="" alt="Tablet and screen time tantrum" data-lazy-src="https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Tablet-temper-tantrum-1200x800.jpg"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img src="https://studyfinds.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Tablet-temper-tantrum-1200x800.jpg" alt="Tablet and screen time tantrum"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;p class="post-featured-image-caption"&gt;(Photo by PeopleImages.com - Yuri A on Shutterstock)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-in-a-nutshell"&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screen time creates a vicious cycle—kids with emotional problems turn to devices for comfort, but screens can make those problems worse over time.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Gaming is the biggest concern, showing much stronger negative effects than watching TV or educational content, especially for older children aged 6-10.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The solution isn’t eliminating screens entirely, but being aware when devices become the automatic response to emotional distress instead of real-world coping strategies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SYDNEY —&lt;/strong&gt; Your 8-year-old has a meltdown, so you hand them an iPad to calm down. It’s a move countless parents have made, but new research reveals this common solution might be creating a troubling problem that feeds on itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A study led by scientists at Australian Catholic University tracking nearly 300,000 children over several years concludes that screen time doesn’t just cause emotional and behavioral problems in kids, it also becomes their go-to coping mechanism when they’re struggling. Screens both &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/screen-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;create problems&lt;/a&gt; and become the solution kids reach for, forming what researchers call a “vicious cycle.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/bul-bul0000468.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Psychological Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, represents the largest analysis ever conducted on how screen use affects children’s emotional development over time. Rather than simply labeling screens as good or bad, it reveals something far more nuanced about how our digital world is reshaping childhood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Screen use may increase the risk of children developing socioemotional problems, and children with socioemotional problems may be drawn to screens, possibly as a way &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/digital-pacifiers-children-emotional-anger-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;to manage their distress&lt;/a&gt;,” the researchers write.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-gaming-proves-most-problematic-for-kids"&gt;Gaming Proves Most Problematic for Kids&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Video games&lt;/a&gt; emerged as the biggest concern in the study. Children who played games were significantly more likely to develop emotional and behavioral issues later on. But here’s the troubling part: kids who already had these problems were even more drawn to gaming than other screen activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When children used screens for gaming, the effects were much stronger than when they used screens for general entertainment like watching TV. Gaming also showed the strongest tendency for troubled kids to seek out this particular screen activity when looking for relief.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Parents who carefully curate educational content for their toddlers while allowing unlimited gaming for their older children might want to reconsider their approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-older-children-face-higher-risks-than-expected"&gt;Older Children Face Higher Risks Than Expected&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Contrary to popular belief, older children (ages 6-10) were actually more susceptible to screen-related problems than younger ones (ages 0-5). The reason appears to be autonomy: older children have more control over their screen choices and more opportunities to use devices as &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/teen-screen-time-scrolling-mental-health-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;emotional escape routes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A 3-year-old might watch whatever parents put on, but a 7-year-old can actively seek out games or videos when feeling upset, angry, or anxious. Gender differences also emerged, with girls showing stronger negative reactions to general screen use, while boys in the older age group were more likely to develop problems from heavy gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-hidden-cost-of-screen-time"&gt;The Hidden Cost of Screen Time&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Every hour a child spends gaming or watching videos is an hour not spent developing social skills with friends, &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/chldren-screen-time-heart-weight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;being physically active&lt;/a&gt;, or learning to manage emotions through real-world experiences. Researchers call this the “displacement effect.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Take a typical scenario: A 9-year-old feels frustrated about a bad day at school. Instead of talking to parents, going outside, or finding another healthy outlet, they retreat to their room with a tablet. The screen provides immediate relief, but the child never learns better coping strategies. Meanwhile, they miss out on the kind of parent-child interaction that actually builds emotional &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/resilience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;resilience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers analyzed data from 117 separate studies spanning multiple countries and cultures, tracking children for periods ranging from six months to several years. They measured both screen use and various emotional and behavioral problems like aggression, anxiety, depression, and attention issues.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study design — following the same children over time rather than just taking snapshots — allowed researchers to see which comes first: the screen problems or the emotional problems. The effects, while statistically small, were consistent across studies. Screens aren’t single-handedly destroying childhood, but they’re contributing to problems in measurable ways that parents and policymakers should take seriously.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Breaking this cycle starts with awareness. &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/category/parenting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Parents who recognize&lt;/a&gt; that their emotionally struggling child might be self-medicating with screens can intervene more thoughtfully. This might mean addressing underlying anxiety or behavioral issues directly, rather than just limiting screen time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors note that some screen use, particularly educational content viewed with parents, shows little to no harmful effects. The problem isn’t screens themselves, but how they’re being used to fill emotional voids that might be better addressed through human connection and real-world experiences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For parents feeling overwhelmed by another study about &lt;a href="https://studyfinds.org/tag/screen-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;screen time dangers&lt;/a&gt;, the message isn’t that you need to throw all devices out the window. Instead, it’s a call to be more aware of the patterns in your own home: when screens become the automatic solution to emotional distress, and what gets displaced in the process. Unlike many childhood challenges, this is one where parents still hold most of the control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 117 longitudinal studies that tracked children over time. The analysis included data from 292,739 children from various countries, with follow-up periods ranging from six months to several years. The team used advanced statistical modeling called “cross-lagged panel analysis” to determine whether screen use led to emotional problems, emotional problems led to more screen use, or both. Studies had to meet strict criteria: children had to be under 10.5 years old at the start, researchers had to measure both screen use and validated emotional/behavioral problems, and studies had to follow children for at least six months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-results"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research found small but significant bidirectional effects: screen use predicted later socioemotional problems, and children with socioemotional problems increased their screen use over time. Gaming showed much stronger effects in both directions compared to other screen activities. Older children (ages 6-10) were more susceptible than younger ones (ages 0-5), and effects were stronger when children exceeded recommended screen time limits. Children using screens above guideline recommendations showed meaningful associations with later problems, while those meeting guidelines showed minimal effects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most studies relied on parent or self-reported screen time rather than objective measurements, which can be inaccurate. The research was predominantly conducted in Western countries with limited racial and ethnic diversity. Very few studies examined newer devices like smartphones and tablets specifically. The effects found were generally small, and the studies couldn’t control for all possible confounding factors like parenting style or family stress. Additionally, many individual studies had methodological limitations such as high dropout rates or lack of preregistration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors reported no specific funding for this work and declared no conflicts of interest. The research was conducted by an international team from universities in Australia, Denmark, Spain, Finland, the United States, and other countries. All data and analysis code are publicly available through the Open Science Framework.&lt;/p&gt;

Ultimately, researchers predicted that those with HSV-1 and a specific gene, called the ApoE-e4 gene, had a higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the Experts: &lt;a href="https://med.uth.edu/neurosciences/dr-david-hunter-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David Hunter, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;David Hunter, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor and neurologist with UTHealth Houston, &lt;a href="https://www.hcahoustonhealthcare.com/physicians/profile/Dr-Linda-S-Yancey-MD" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Linda Yancey, M.D.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Linda Yancey, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; an infectious disease doctor at Memorial Hermann Health System; and &lt;a href="https://tun.touro.edu/programs/osteopathic-medicine/faculty--staff/basic-sciences/faculty-members/mark-f-santos.php" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mark Santos, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mark Santos, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Touro University Nevada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study co-author Ruth Itzhaki, Ph.D., summarized her team’s findings in a recent article for &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/thirty-years-on-our-research-linking-viral-infections-with-alzheimers-is-finally-getting-the-attention-it-deserves-254656" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The Conversation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and noted that, over the years, additional work has surfaced to support hers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what does it all mean, exactly? If a cold sore pops up, should you be concerned about dementia? We reached out to experts who explained everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is HSV-1?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“HSV-1 is a common virus to which almost everyone is exposed early in life,” says &lt;a href="https://med.uth.edu/neurosciences/dr-david-hunter-md/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:David Hunter, M.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;David Hunter, M.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor and neurologist with UTHealth Houston. “It is best known for causing cold sores and is closely related to chicken pox and mononucleosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What these viruses have in common is that they are &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/neurotropism" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:neurotropic;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;neurotropic&lt;/a&gt;, meaning they linger in the nervous system long after the initial illness, explains &lt;a href="https://www.hcahoustonhealthcare.com/physicians/profile/Dr-Linda-S-Yancey-MD" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Linda Yancey, M.D.,;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Linda Yancey, M.D.,&lt;/a&gt; an infectious disease doctor at Memorial Hermann Health System, and can be reactivated by stress or lowered immunity. That’s how, for instance, chicken pox can manifest later in life as shingles, adds Dr. Hunter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The virus’s ability to infiltrate the nerves is believed to get it past the blood-brain barrier, a membrane that shields the organ from infection via the bloodstream. Thanks to that entry point, Dr. Hunter says, HSV-1 is the most common cause of viral brain inflammation in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is no vaccine for HSV and almost everyone will get it by adulthood,” Dr. Hunter adds. Cold sores are a mild case of it, and symptoms can be treated with antiviral drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How HSV-1 and Alzheimer’s may be connected&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dormant HSV-1 may be reactivated by illness and reach the brain, explains &lt;a href="https://tun.touro.edu/programs/osteopathic-medicine/faculty--staff/basic-sciences/faculty-members/mark-f-santos.php" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mark Santos, Ph.D.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mark Santos, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Touro University Nevada. This can trigger brain inflammation over time, known as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557643/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:herpes encephalitis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;herpes encephalitis&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;br&gt;and in people with genetic risk factors, like the ApoE-4 gene, contribute to Alzheimer’s development, he adds. “We don’t entirely know why ApoE-4 is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s,” adds Dr. Hunter. “The link to HSV could be that ApoE-4 impacts the blood-brain barrier and makes it easier for HSV to enter.” And the inflammation caused by that entry may heighten Alzheimer’s risk. “It is now universally accepted that inflammation in the brain is a key step in the development of Alzheimer’s,” Dr. Hunter reiterates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What experts think&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the three decades since the original study, doctors and researchers have learned much more about Alzheimer’s disease and its connection to viral inflammation. For instance, several &lt;a href="https://www.uth.edu/news/story/several-vaccines-associated-with-reduced-risk-of-alzheimers-disease-in-adults-65-and-older" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:studies;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that being immunized for any disease (like COVID-19 or the flu) reduces Alzheimer’s risk, says Dr. Hunter. “Several other studies have shown that reducing inflammation in the brain helps prevent Alzheimer’s,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Santos concurs. “Since 1996, additional studies have found HSV-1 DNA in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer’s. Lab studies have also shown that HSV-1 infection can trigger the buildup of amyloid-beta and tau—proteins strongly associated with Alzheimer’s pathology,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there are a few disclaimers to note. Firstly, the posed risk is associated with people who contract HSV-1 in early life, giving it time to progressively cause inflammation. The risk may be lower in adults, says Santos. “That said, if someone has other risk factors (like a weakened immune system or APOE-e4), adult-onset HSV-1 could still have long-term consequences,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, neurotropic viruses are extremely common, Dr. Yancey reiterates. “This makes it difficult to tease out whether they are causing neurologic problems or are simply common in the general population, including people with neurologic problems,” she adds. In other words, because most people end up with HSV-1 doesn’t necessarily mean that most people will get Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most cold sores aren’t a cause for concern,” Santos adds. “They’re common and usually well-controlled by the immune system. But for people with frequent outbreaks, weakened immunity, or APOE-e4, it may be worth discussing with a healthcare provider. The concern is not a single cold sore, but long-term viral activity in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More research, including long-term studies, is needed to make any solid associations, Santos and Dr. Yancey conclude. “The current data is based on population-level surveys. There is no way to predict on an individual patient’s level whether this has a meaningful impact,” says Dr. Yancey. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will, hopefully, at least help experts understand how antiviral treatment affects Alzheimer’s risk, as well as identify better ways to detect when HSV-1 is active in the brain. “The hope is that understanding how infections contribute to Alzheimer’s will open up new ways to prevent or treat it—especially before symptoms start,” says Santos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Lifestyle choices that may help lower dementia risk&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being vaccinated, exercising, engaging in mental stimulation, and maintaining a &lt;a href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/healthy-eating/g33416014/heart-healthy-food-wd/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart-healthy diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart-healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; are all known ways to lower dementia risk, our experts say. Avoiding smoking or nicotine use of any kind can also “drastically” reduce the risk, says Dr. Yancey. All of these habits and choices work together to support both immune and brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 14:18:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE1LVjlfbG1Vbl8zeDlrZklBWjRvdkxLWGN1dmpzLUZVTE1vOXRNOGoyY1lPMTE4cGduTXNoU3JLenZ1SzhoNnBYVl9qMEVLZmU1MDhhdFU4SXhXenBpOWt5cGFxTGVMeWQ3amw3aW9VdVI5UkFxXzZBa0dtMmZqV1U</guid></item><item><title>“服用Mounjaro后，我的生活崩溃了” ：女性揭示了从中开始的刺拳的令人不安的副作用-每日邮报 | 'After taking Mounjaro, my life fell apart': Women reveal disturbing side effects from jab that started within - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women have reported terrifying mental health side effects after taking Mounjaro—the popular weight-loss injection used by thousands of people in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some describe sudden panic attacks, crippling anxiety and a sensation of 'tugging in the brain' after starting the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mounjaro, along with similar treatments such as Ozempic and Wegovy, can help dieters lose up to 15 per cent of their body weight in a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An estimated 1.5 million Britons used weight-loss jabs in March 2025 alone—and the new wave of jabs have been hailed as a breakthrough in the fight against obesity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But growing numbers of patients say they have experienced unexpected mental health symptoms—including insomnia, tremors, shortness of breath and tinnitus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although these are not currently listed as official side effects for any of the three major jabs in the UK, an online support group for users suffering such symptoms has attracted more than 2,800 members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Three members—speaking anonymously to The Times—described the onset of debilitating anxiety, sleeplessness and panic attacks after starting Mounjaro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One said the anxiety felt like a kind of 'terror' she had never experienced before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cases have prompted fresh questions over the safety profile of the medications as their use becomes more widespread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;

After two nights awake I started to feel like I was losing my mind,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;It is estimated a 1.5 million people in the UK used weight-loss jabs, which have been hailed the solution to the obesity epidemic, in March 2025 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It wasn't just difficulty sleeping, three days after she started experiencing symptoms, she went to A&amp;amp;E when her 'heart was pounding nonstop'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the hospital an ECG revealed her heart was above the normal resting heart rate for adults, which is between 60 and 100 beats per minute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But while it was 105bpm compared to her normal resting heart rate of 70bpm, the rhythm wasn't irregular, so she was discharged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I explained I hadn't slept in days and they basically told me to go home and have a bath,' she said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite still struggling to sleep, her GP was unable to help, as she had 'reached the limit of what she could prescribe'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Things got worse when she was hit by a series of panic attacks and tremors for five weeks—which she likened to 'swallowing an earthquake'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Although she had noted in her application for the medication she had experienced some anxiety and insomnia in the past, it was still approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the anxiety she now experienced she described as 'a physical terror I've never known. Like a switch had been flipped in my brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Things got worse when she was hit by a series of panic attacks and tremors for five weeks—which she likened to 'swallowing an earthquake'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I went into a constant state of fight-or-flight—like a bad drug trip that wouldn't end. I couldn't see how I was going to be able to survive it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Initially signed off work unable to 'do anything' or even 'follow a conversation', she later resigned with her relationship ending that same week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The woman who said her life 'just fell apart', said: 'The way I see it, it's a roll of the dice as to how you're going to react to these drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If people knew that they could have potentially catastrophic mental and physical side-effects, they could make a more informed decision about taking them.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Lloyd isn't the only one experiencing psychological side effects—another woman also found herself in A&amp;amp;E after taking the jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Maria Edwards, ended up in hospital last year only 48 hours after taking her first dose of the Mounjaro jab.&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.thetimes.com/life-style/celebrity/article/after-taking-weight-loss-drugs-my-life-fell-apart-g76cd9bkc"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When her BMI was over 30, so she too qualified for the weight loss jab which got from the online doctor, MedExpress. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I thought I was having a heart attack,' she said, but her scans, x-trays and bloods taken, all came back clear.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: 'I've never had any mental health problems. I've never had a panic attack or anxiety. I've always been a laid-back person and now it's like everything is stressful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I get this thing that we've termed 'air hunger' where it's like I can't take a deep breath. If I'd have known Mounjaro could have mental health side-effects I never would have taken it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The third woman, Julie Peters, a 31 year-old mother from Birmingham had a similar experience after getting the jab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She had a panic attack that lasted two hours on January 11, after taking the lowest dose, 2.5mg, of Mounjaro, once a week for two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mother went to A&amp;amp;E also thinking she was having a heart attack, but similarly she said: 'tests on my heart, kidneys, and for pancreatitis all came back clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ms Peters also described experiencing tremors, a 'tugging' sensation in her brain' and tinnitus—'The ringing in my ears has been constant, sometimes with multiple ringing sounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The pressure and heaviness in my brain make me feel dull, disconnected and nauseous, and I also have a sensitivity to motion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I recently requested a brain MRI, and while the results came back normal, I am relieved yet uncertain about what to do next. It's incredibly suffocating,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It follows &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10960895/"&gt;a study published&lt;/a&gt; in January last year in the International Journal of Clinical Pharmacy which found 481 psychiatric events were linked to weight loss jabs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The 'seriousness of the adverse events warrants additional research' to explore the causual relationship,' said lead authors, Hajer Elkout and Mansour Tobaiqy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This was despite psychiatric events only accounting for 1.2 per cent of total reports associated with the active ingredients in weight loss medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Anxiety, depression nor insomnia were listed as potential side effects by Asda Online Doctor by Zava or in the patient leaflet they refer patients to. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The clinical governance team at the private pharmacist who stressed patient safety told The Times all applicants are required to give their medical history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This includes their GP details which they said enables the GP to inform them 'of any discrepancies or concerns they have with the prescription'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added there are studies evidencing mental health can be improved with treatment, and no clinical-based-evidence of a negative impact 'they are aware of'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38182782/"&gt;a study published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal of Natural Medicine found taking semaglutide for weight loss or diabetes reduced the incidence of suicidal ideation.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, a &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14643325/harmful-effects-Ozempic-weight-loss-drugs.html"&gt;more recent study&lt;/a&gt; found Ozempic and Mounjaro can raise the risk of depression and suicidal thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Asda Online Doctor by Zava added: 'Our doctors, of course, will provide suitable advice to any particular patients of concern or who are managing complex mental health issues and may not be able to use the treatment appropriately alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'These patients, where necessary, will be signposted to their GPs for further support to manage their weight.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The manufacturers of Mounjaro, Eli Lilly, and of both Ozempic and Wegovy, Novo Nordisk told The Times patient safety was their top priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We take any reports about patient safety seriously and actively monitor, evaluate and report safety information for all our medicines,' said Eli Lilly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With Novo Nordisk adding it welcomes: 'Independent research investigating the safety, efficacy and clinical utility of our products.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The two drug companies both highlighted that the UK regulatory agency had assessed the risk and benefits approving their respective drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Novo Nordisk added that independent analysis 'did not find an association between use of GLP-1RA medicines and the occurrence of increased risk of suicidal thoughts or actions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Much of Canada is ablaze again, with more than 200 active wildfires having consumed roughly 10,000 square miles (26,000 square kilometers) since January, the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://ciffc.net/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;reported&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Thursday, June 5. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This escalating situation pumped massive amounts of smoke across the Canada-U.S. border, affecting air quality as far south as Florida, according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/news/noaa-satellites-monitor-canadian-wildfires-and-smoke"&gt;&lt;span&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (NOAA). As climate change &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/climate-change-indicators-wildfires"&gt;&lt;span&gt;lengthens and intensifies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; wildfire season in many regions across the world, understanding the dangers of smoke exposure is increasingly important. A wave of new research paints a complex picture of how wildfire smoke impacts the body, linking it to startling health outcomes that go far beyond the respiratory system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There is an urgent need for research to fully understand the health impacts of wildfire smoke to raise awareness among public and health professionals, as well as to support the development of effective regulations to mitigate the impacts,” Yaguang Wei, assistant professor of environmental medicine at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine, recently told the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/06/wildfire-smoke-can-harm-heart-and-lungs-even-after-the-fire-has-ended/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Harvard Gazette&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wei is the lead author of a new study, published in May in the journal &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/epidem/abstract/9900/medium_term_exposure_to_wildfire_smoke_pm2_5_and.374.aspx"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Epidemiology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which found that wildfire smoke can damage the lungs and heart for up to three months after the fire is out. He and his colleagues linked this “medium-term” exposure to increased risks of various cardiorespiratory conditions, including heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, pneumonia, chronic lung disease, and asthma.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Even brief exposures from smaller fires that last only a few days can lead to long-lasting health effects,” Wei told the Harvard Gazette.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Infectious fumes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Wildfire smoke is a mixture of gases, air pollutants, water vapor, and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/wildfire-smoke-course/why-wildfire-smoke-health-concern"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; (EPA). It contains significant levels of toxic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), some of which are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/volatile-organic-compounds-impact-indoor-air-quality"&gt;&lt;span&gt;known&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/risk/other-carcinogenic-polycyclic-aromatic-hydrocarbons#:~:text=List%20of%20carcinogenic%20polycyclic%20aromatic,other%20than%20benzo%5Ba%5Dpyrene"&gt;&lt;span&gt;carcinogens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Recent studies even suggest that wildfire smoke carries microbial and fungal pathogens.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One such study, published in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41396-020-00788-8"&gt;&lt;span&gt;ISME Journal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in 2021, noted that 80% of microbes found in wildfire smoke samples were still viable. While it’s still unclear how these organisms survive the extremely high temperatures in wildfires, researchers do have an idea of how they get into the smoke in the first place. George Thompson, a professor of medicine at the University of California, Davis, who was not involved in the study, told Gizmodo that wildfires pull pathogens from the surrounding soil and vegetation as they draw in air.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The findings, published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(23)00046-3/fulltext"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The Lancet, Planetary Health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, associated California wildfires with an 18% to 22% increase in invasive fungal infections such as &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/valley-fever/index.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;valley fever&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Thompson pointed out that the study was based on large hospital data, which is “a great start,” but further research will need to corroborate this link. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;The brain on fire&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The most hazardous component of wildfire smoke is not pathogens, but PM2.5. These minuscule particles penetrate deep inside the lungs and wreak havoc on the respiratory system. Previous research has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32456361/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;shown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that the tiniest, ultrafine particles can pass from the lungs directly into the bloodstream. This can &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/40/20/1590/5372326"&gt;&lt;span&gt;damage&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; blood vessels and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6250783/#:~:text=Translocated%20particles%20as%20well%20as,%2C%20and%20chronic%20heart%20failure)."&gt;&lt;span&gt;trigger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; harmful inflammation and oxidative stress in various organs, including the brain. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Multiple studies have associated wildfire smoke exposure with incidence of dementia. Last year, research published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/article-abstract/2827124"&gt;&lt;span&gt;JAMA Neurology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; analyzed health data from more than 1.2 million Southern Californians aged 60 and older, and found a significant link between long-term exposure to wildfire-related PM2.5 and a heightened risk of dementia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Specifically, every 1 microgram per cubic meter increase in the three-year average of wildfire PM2.5 raised the odds of a dementia diagnosis by 18%. In comparison, the same increase in PM2.5 from non-wildfire sources was linked to only a 1% greater risk of developing dementia. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I was expecting for us to see an association between wildfire smoke exposure and dementia,” lead author Holly Elser, an epidemiologist and resident physician in neurology at the University of Pennsylvania, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2024-07-29/study-wildfire-smoke-raises-dementia-risk-more-than-other-pollutants"&gt;&lt;span&gt;told&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; the Los Angeles Times in 2024. “But the fact we see so much stronger of an association for wildfire as compared to non-wildfire smoke exposure was kind of surprising.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Psychological fallout &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Other studies have linked wildfire smoke to adverse psychological outcomes. Research published in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2832210"&gt;&lt;span&gt;JAMA Network Open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in April analyzed data on wildfire PM2.5 levels and mental health-related emergency department visits throughout California between July and December 2022—the state’s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2020#:~:text=911%20Translate%20Settings-,2020,Search:"&gt;&lt;span&gt;worst&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; wildfire season on record. The study found that wildfire smoke correlated with a significant spike in mental health emergency department visits for up to seven days post-exposure. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Our study suggests that—in addition to the trauma a wildfire can induce—smoke itself may play a direct role in worsening mental health conditions like depression, anxiety, and mood disorders,” co-author Kari Nadeau, a physician-scientist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said in a university &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/exposure-to-wildfire-smoke-linked-with-worsening-mental-health-conditions/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;statement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span&gt;Questions remain &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;All of this research demonstrates that wildfire smoke is more than just a respiratory hazard. But experts are still in the early stages of unraveling its complex health impacts—particularly in terms of mental health, Angela Yao, a senior scientist with the Environmental Health Services at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control in Canada, told Gizmodo. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many questions remain unanswered, she said. For example, “How do you disentangle the impact of smoke from the impact of the fire itself?” Future studies will need to investigate these confounding factors. But, “even with the current evidence that we have—it already &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;gives us confidence that we should take a lot of action,” she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To protect yourself from the hazards of wildfire smoke, Yao recommended limiting the length and intensity of time spent outdoors. “The harder you breathe, the more smoke you inhale,” she said. If you must go outside, wearing an N95 mask or a P100 can reduce your smoke exposure, according to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2018-11/documents/respiratory_protection-no-niosh-5081.pdf"&gt;&lt;span&gt;EPA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Keep windows and doors shut to ensure that your indoor air is safe. It’s also important to make sure your home’s HVAC system is running properly, Yao added. If you don’t have one, you can purchase a portable air filter or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://cleanaircrew.org/box-fan-filters/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; your own using a furnace filter and a box fan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;As wildfire season becomes increasingly impactful, taking steps to protect yourself and your family from smoke has never been more critical. Experts still have a long way to go towards fully understanding the risks of wildfire exposure, but one thing is clear—these hazards aren’t going away any time soon.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Scientists have uncovered a surprising fungus that incorporates gold into its structure in soils where trace particles of this metal occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery raises eyebrows because gold rarely reacts with living organisms. It caught everyone’s attention when researchers noticed bits of gold attached to the microscopic strands of the fungus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kew.org/read-and-watch/fungi-hidden-dimension" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mycelium&lt;/a&gt; are the fine, thread-like filaments that help fungi absorb nutrients. In the case of this fungus, they seem capable of interacting with gold through metabolism in ways many believed to be nearly impossible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Gold is so chemically inactive that this type of interaction is unusual and surprising,” remarked &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=7_x-MfQAAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Tsing Bohu&lt;/a&gt;, the lead researcher at &lt;a href="https://www.csiro.au/en/news/all/news/2019/may/gold-coated-fungi-are-the-new-gold-diggers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;CSIRO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-discovering-gold-eating-fungus"&gt;Discovering gold-eating fungus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bohu and his colleagues at CSIRO, first observed that the fungus grows faster and appears healthier when gold attaches to its cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts think these findings could help geologists detect underground gold deposits through more targeted surveys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploration companies have historically analyzed plants, soils, and even water to locate gold-rich areas, but the use of gold-seeking fungi opens the door for a more focused approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans have been obsessed with &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/couple-finds-a-gold-nugget-measuring-7-inches-across-weighing-more-than-9-pounds/"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; for centuries because of its scarcity and status in global markets. It is essential in medical devices, smartphones, and numerous other technologies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/supergiant-gold-deposit-find-claims-to-be-the-worlds-largest-discovery-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;effort to mine gold&lt;/a&gt; comes with challenges, including large excavation sites and water-intensive processing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new fungal method could reduce environmental pressures because it taps into the natural processes of living organisms rather than relying on large-scale digging or harsh chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-this-gold-fungus-stands-out"&gt;Why this “gold fungus” stands out&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fungus studied by the Australian team belongs to strains similar to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/fusarium-oxysporum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fusarium oxysporum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has been reported to transform inorganic particles through metabolic pathways. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These pathways allow gold to accumulate in or on the fungal filaments over time. The fungus in question draws energy from its surroundings in ways that encourage gold accumulation, though researchers are still pinpointing the precise enzymes involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An intriguing strain called &lt;a href="https://www.mycobank.org/details/708/105304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Candida rugopelliculosa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has also been noted for producing gold nanoparticles through a stress response when exposed to certain gold compounds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists suggest that these microorganisms release specific &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24456802/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;polysaccharides&lt;/a&gt; and proteins to reduce the metal ions and keep the resulting gold in stable nanoparticle form. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This biological trick could be a big win for miners looking for less destructive ways to harvest precious metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-turning-eyes-toward-the-stars"&gt;Turning eyes toward the stars&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Space agencies and private companies are already exploring methods to mine resources on asteroids, whose metal content is often richer than that of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/earths-first-crust-already-had-chemical-traits-of-modern-continents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Earth’s crust&lt;/a&gt;. The fungus’s ability to process gold in harsh conditions shows potential for extraterrestrial applications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some researchers envision deploying specialized microbial colonies to break down metals in orbiting rocks, transforming space mining into a more efficient, lighter operation without the need for massive excavators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engineers debate how well a &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-eating-fungus-beauveria-bassiana-causes-the-immune-system-to-attack-neurons/"&gt;fungus&lt;/a&gt; would perform in low-gravity environments with limited nutrients. Yet the concept of sending living systems into space to work on raw materials intrigues those who want to lower mission costs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the fungus can multiply and process metals using minimal equipment, it might shift how organizations plan resource extraction far from Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-fresh-angle-on-sustainability"&gt;Fresh angle on sustainability&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governments worldwide are tightening environmental rules on mining because of landscape damage and water pollution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditional methods to extract gold frequently involve toxic substances or large energy inputs. The new fungus-based approach presents an idea that goes hand-in-hand with more eco-conscious strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also potentially safer for workers, who could see a reduced need for heavy machinery. More importantly, harnessing a living organism’s capabilities means that gold may be collected in forms that are easier to refine with fewer harsh processes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although these notions remain in the early stages, they shine a light on how biology can inform industrial practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-challenges-and-future-plans"&gt;Challenges and future plans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists must still figure out how to cultivate this organism on a grand scale. The &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/family-photographs-a-rare-red-cane-fungus-thought-to-be-extinct-stinkhorn-mushroom/"&gt;fungus&lt;/a&gt; may need very particular conditions to produce gold particles efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moisture, soil pH, and other minerals might influence how well it grows and how much gold it accumulates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensuring no harmful mutations take place during large-scale fungal cultivation is also a concern. The introduction of any non-native organism to new environments warrants caution, especially if plans involve use in space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collaboration among biologists, engineers, and mining experts could clarify best practices so that the fungus remains beneficial without unexpected ecological impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-prospects-for-the-mining-industry"&gt;Prospects for the mining industry&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some mining firms are already discussing the potential for gold-focused fungal detection kits. These kits could analyze samples in less time than typical drilling and surveying routines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the fungus picks up subtle traces of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-gold-rush-begins-as-very-high-volume-deposit-identified-in-a-single-drill-hole/"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, exploration teams would zero in on precise areas with a higher likelihood of viable deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same methods could apply to other metals that share certain chemical traits with gold. Meanwhile, ongoing research is exploring variations of the fungus that absorb different elements to aid geologists in pinpointing new sources of valuable minerals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10966691/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heliyon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 13:24:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi4gFBVV95cUxORk10TEs1NEY4LTVXMjd5VGFfaEtaZU9GdFdxSV96ajdjVzVCaEhzYUg1Y0dwQXk1ZVFSaHZ2ei1OWkxBZU9RY3VvVU5sX2dyM3lGb1BvQ05mT216a051TnRxRTk2U25wMTRnUXJmMFZhQkRRUmxaWEtWSC1YV3R6UGxYSkRWdmNnZGo2eWVQdldmV20zOVlHekNIZERRdW9adlA4dnJ5dmR2aGczbk94al9IN3BqOUxtMmFSa3ljWkRsZmF6SEdnUmc2Q0pkT0YwUVM5UE5uMjFfOEI3Rnk4WUZB</guid></item><item><title>令人震惊的“Ozempic手”的崛起，让名人看起来“不死” -每日邮报 | Shocking rise of 'Ozempic HANDS' that leaves celebs looking 'undead' - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMitwFBVV95cUxQMW85NURTb3B2bXdTZ0RFenpDZkp4UE9tSjZ1R2NxSWFoYzkyRFpxUEVabXJXNzNRMVVpZWtLQ1RKYnRaZVk1Q3JNOUZpRXdZUF84OThUcGtZUDhUWWFhNDFuUng5d3ZDeVVDTm5hVDdyOXVkaG9LYzV1NjFENEE0VDFqWUxNLTU4b0J5VkRBRU5EdGpUcjhiTlFzQldVNlYtbEd0cGpsYW1FekZ0SnM3YlA5X2tPRnM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts have raised the alarm over a bizarre new side effect &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14550239/Ozempic-arms-legs-bums-look-like-MELTED-CANDLES-terrifying-new-effect-rapidly-emerging-weight-loss-drugs-young-people.html"&gt;linked to weight-loss jabs - dubbed 'Ozempic hands&lt;/a&gt;'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The term refers to the thinning, almost skeletal appearance of the hands and fingers reported in some people on drugs such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As the treatment triggers rapid fat and muscle loss across the body, subcutaneous fat is also stripped from the hands - leaving bones, veins and tendons more prominent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The phenomenon was recognised when the jabs first began to be widely used, and some patients reported needing to have wedding and engagement rings resized as their fingers slimmed down, along with their waistlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now the trend is back in the spotlight after viral social media videos highlighted how the hands of certain celebrities appear to have changed dramatically over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These have prompted a wave of online speculation about whether it might be an effect of weight-loss injections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One clip, which has been viewed over three million times, focused on &lt;a target="_self" href="/tv/reality-tv/index.html" id="mol-8f6e9960-408a-11f0-baf7-5b08ba8bab7a"&gt;reality TV&lt;/a&gt; star &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/khloe_kardashian/index.html" id="mol-8f6e9961-408a-11f0-baf7-5b08ba8bab7a" class=""&gt;Khloe Kardashian&lt;/a&gt;, comparing images of her hands recently and a decade before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the creator of the video didn't speculate as to the cause, social media users were quick to suggest it was due to blockbuster weight-loss drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Khloe Kardashian hasn't said she has used a weight-loss jab but previously did say she would have tried them when she was attempting to lose weight in her younger years. Khloe pictured here in 2022&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Clips on social media have compared Khloe's hands to images taken of the reality TV star in 2012, like this one.

    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'Ozempic hands' is just the latest in a series of side effects people have speculated A-listers may be suffering from after taking weight-loss jabs &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In extreme and rapid cases of weight loss - such as that which occurs in people using weight-loss jabs - surgery can be the only remedy for this excess skin. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But it's not just a cosmetic issue; patients with excess skin can also suffer mobility problems and infections due to excess skin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And if they choose to fix the issue with surgery, they also face the inescapable risk of surgical complications including blood clots. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The issue of the aesthetic aftermath of weight-loss jabs is only going to grow larger as the drugs are dished out to more and more people.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;About 4,000 patients a month are prescribed GLP-1 drugs on the NHS in the UK, with almost 350,000 patients receiving the medications in 2024, though additionally 500,000 are thought to be taking the drugs privately.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;And more could be on the way - as British GPs will be able to prescribe the jabs directly to patients from this month.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is a shake-up from the previous system which required patients to attend a specialist NHS weight-loss clinic to get the jabs on the health service.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, this will initially only be available for &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14767431/weight-loss-jabs-NHS-ETHAN-ENNALS-drugs-FREE-GP.html"&gt;severely obese patients with multiple health conditions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But it is expected more patients will be able to get the jabs from their family doctor as restrictions are relaxed over the next three years. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the US, it is estimated about 13 per cent of the population - roughly 33million people - have tried the drugs at least once. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the injections have been linked to multiple health benefits that go beyond combating obesity, including &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-13412979/Millions-Brits-Ozempic-slash-chances-heart-attack-stroke-biggest-breakthrough-statins.html"&gt;a reduced risk of heart attack and stroke&lt;/a&gt;, other studies suggest that could also carry some risks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One recent &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14773791/ozempic-weight-loss-drugs-kidney-cancer-risk-study.html"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;suggested they could raise the risk of a type of cancer that is surging in young people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 13:17:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitwFBVV95cUxQMW85NURTb3B2bXdTZ0RFenpDZkp4UE9tSjZ1R2NxSWFoYzkyRFpxUEVabXJXNzNRMVVpZWtLQ1RKYnRaZVk1Q3JNOUZpRXdZUF84OThUcGtZUDhUWWFhNDFuUng5d3ZDeVVDTm5hVDdyOXVkaG9LYzV1NjFENEE0VDFqWUxNLTU4b0J5VkRBRU5EdGpUcjhiTlFzQldVNlYtbEd0cGpsYW1FekZ0SnM3YlA5X2tPRnM</guid></item><item><title>当我们的大脑空白时会发生什么-雅虎 | What happens when our brain goes blank - Yahoo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidEFVX3lxTE9BZGtWWHlQWGZDSzNaZFhnZThrcDMzWjRza1NWZlhWM0RMMmIzcGNIWHFTNGZQYXZuWWc4Rk5TZ2pWaEdrTjBvTGMxTmQyQ3hXb1VrbUVyNWE4Q2ItMU1VYmhhVGtDZ28zamlhVHUxYjlCakFI?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="" data-article-body="true"&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;My thoughts often feel like endless streams of information. That’s until someone asks me the name of a stranger I met six or seven seconds before, and my mind goes blank. Mind blanking is much more common than you might think. Researchers think that &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00034-8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:our minds are blank;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;our minds are blank&lt;/a&gt; somewhere between 5 and 20 percent of the time. Neuroscientists face significant hurdles in adding color and detail to the mystery of an empty mind, but new research is trying to establish the edges of these formless thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Defining the blank mind&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.uliege.be/cms/c_9054334/en/directory?uid=u205869" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Athena Demertzi;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Athena Demertzi&lt;/a&gt;, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Liège, recently published a review paper on &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(25)00034-8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mind-blanking research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;mind-blanking research&lt;/a&gt;. The field has struggled to agree on what the term means–Demertzi’s paper lists no fewer than seven different definitions. Her preferred view is that mind blanking is about “the impression of having no thoughts or not being able to report any thoughts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This interpretation is intentionally vague, as people can use all kinds of language to self-report a mind blank. Examples include “I don’t remember what I was thinking” or “I wasn’t paying attention.” Demertzi says that this can trip up researchers who attempt to incorporate other &lt;a href="https://tech.yahoo.com/science/articles/see-most-detailed-map-human-180000521.html" data-ylk="slk:brain;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; processes, such as &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/story/science/unique-memory/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:memory;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt;, into their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Within this broad definition, Demertzi then works to separate different strands of mind blanking. This work is fraught with complications. One of the most reliable tools for examining the brain’s inner workings is functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Demertzi explains that fMRI researchers often ask their volunteers to “think of nothing” while in the scanner. Doing so causes &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31389642/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:activation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;activation&lt;/a&gt; along the midline of the brain in regions like the cingulate cortex, says Demertzi. However, rather than being a marker of a blank mind, this signal is a cognitive marker of the effort required to suppress thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;A signal behind mind blanking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To block out this signal, Demertzi tried a different strategy. In a 2023 study, her team &lt;a href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/43/40/6807.abstract" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:monitored the brains of people at rest;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;monitored the brains of people at rest&lt;/a&gt; in a scanner. At random intervals, participants were asked to report what they had been thinking of. The team then analyzed the brain activity patterns in the seconds preceding their response. The brains of individuals who reported blank minds showed a distinct signal, a pattern involving a momentary synchronization of brain networks. “They are all deactivated,” says Demertzi. This signal is also seen during sleep or anesthesia, she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This finding is supported by other research that has established &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81618-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a strong link between mind blanking and the level of stimulation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;a strong link between mind blanking and the level of stimulation&lt;/a&gt; our brains are experiencing, called arousal. When arousal levels are low, mind-blanking episodes are more likely to occur. This is suggested to be because high arousal is necessary to keep up a continuous stream of thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;There may be a cost to keeping up a very high state of arousal, however. At high levels, this focus tips over into anxiety, which inhibits performance. Demertzi’s paper points out that these anxious states can lead to racing thoughts that may blur individual ideas and make them hard to recall–another form of mind blanking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;Mind blanking and ADHD&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In certain cases, mind blanking can even be a feature of clinical conditions. “We know that it manifests in clinical states like ADHD,” says Demertzi. Unmedicated kids with &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/adhd-may-evolved-us-foraging-130000557.html" data-ylk="slk:ADHD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;ADHD&lt;/a&gt; report &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617708234" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:mind blanking at a higher rate;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;mind blanking at a higher rate&lt;/a&gt; than kids without the condition. Other conditions that feature racing thoughts, like generalized anxiety disorder, also include mind blanking as a related feature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The ultimate question for Demertzi is why mind blanking happens in the first place. Researchers are still trying to figure this out, although she suggests that the link to sleep and arousal may be a hint. “When we sleep,” says Demertzi, “Our neurons are getting rest by throwing away what has been accumulated throughout the day through the glymphatic system.” &lt;br&gt;Demertzi says that this &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7698404/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:toxin-clearing function;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;toxin-clearing function&lt;/a&gt;–which is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01638-y" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:disputed by some sleep neuroscientists;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;disputed by some sleep neuroscientists&lt;/a&gt;–may also occur in brief periods while we are awake. We notice these “pit stops” in cognition as mind blanks. Ultimately, these blanks may be a way our brain maintains high function for the rest of our waking experience. “How can you sustain a continuous wakeful life if our brains are not helping a bit?” says Demertzi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 13:05:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE9BZGtWWHlQWGZDSzNaZFhnZThrcDMzWjRza1NWZlhWM0RMMmIzcGNIWHFTNGZQYXZuWWc4Rk5TZ2pWaEdrTjBvTGMxTmQyQ3hXb1VrbUVyNWE4Q2ItMU1VYmhhVGtDZ28zamlhVHUxYjlCakFI</guid></item><item><title>人民药店：这种非处方过敏药物是否导致我膝盖疼痛？ - OregonLive.com | People’s Pharmacy: Did this OTC allergy medicine cause my excruciating knee pain? - OregonLive.com</title><link>https://news.google.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?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content "&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BWVOY24CQBDELDXQ6NXPISPPEE"&gt;&lt;b&gt;DEAR PEOPLE’S PHARMACY:&lt;/b&gt; After trying several nasal sprays and prescription medications for severe seasonal allergies, I was thrilled to find that levocetirizine worked wonders.

&lt;p&gt;Jacqueline Mills is used to seeing spots — but this one was different.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The 32-year-old public school teacher rushed to a dermatologist after a small mark suddenly appeared on her right cheek, the threat of skin cancer weighing on her mind.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But instead of a diagnosis, Mills got dismissed. “They were worried about me getting a scar on my face and not wanting to test it,” she told The Post. “That’s when I sought a second opinion.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Melanoma is on the rise among young women, including survivors like Jackie Mills. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Jacqueline Mills&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a good thing she did. Tests at Mount Sinai revealed the spot was stage zero melanoma, a deadly form of skin cancer that’s been rising rapidly in young adults, especially women.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known for spreading quickly throughout the body, melanoma can become life-threatening in as little as six weeks if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Mole patrol&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With a family history of melanoma, Mills was no stranger to skin checks and gets a full-body scan from her dermatologist once a year.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;While she’s “covered with spots,” the mark on her cheek stood out when it began to change and grow rapidly. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The first thing I noticed was that there was some discoloration, one side of it was lighter than the other side, ” Mills said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What really set me off was that the borders were very jagged and irregular. The shape was also strange, it wasn’t a perfect circle,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A brown, irregularly shaped spot with jagged edges appeared on Mills’ cheek.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those are classic red flags for skin cancer, said &lt;a href="https://profiles.mountsinai.org/jesse-miller-lewin" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Dr. Jesse Miller Lewin&lt;/a&gt;, vice chair of surgical operations and system chief of the Division of Dermatologic and Cosmetic Surgery at Mount Sinai Health System.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He told The Post that one easy way to remember the warning signs is to follow the ABCDEs of melanoma:&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; is for asymmetry: Cancerous moles tend to be misshapen.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; is for border: Melanomas often have jagged, uneven edges.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; is for color: Look out for lesions that are more than one color or shade.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; is for diameter: Spots larger than 6 mm (about the size of a pencil eraser) are a concern.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt; is for evolution: Changes in a mole’s size, shape or color can signal danger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“A history of change or “evolution” of an existing pigmented lesion is the most predictive sign of melanoma among all the ABCDE criteria,” Lewin said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No moles? That doesn’t mean you’re off the hook. Most melanomas appear as brand-new spots on previously clear, healthy skin. The cancer can develop anywhere, including the eyes, scalp, nails, feet and even inside the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Face to face with cancer&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Melanoma may be one of the deadliest skin cancers. However, if caught early, it’s highly treatable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Melanoma signs include changes in the size, shape or color of a mole or new skin growth. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Pixel-Shot – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;When diagnosed at stage zero, the five-year survival rate is over 99%. But once it spreads to distant organs and body parts, like the lungs or bones, that number nosedives to just 35%, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/melanoma-skin-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/survival-rates-for-melanoma-skin-cancer-by-stage.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It was a blessing and a curse that this was on my face,” Mills said. “It made it harder to remove, and I do have a scar, but I think it’s why I noticed the changes so quickly and they caught it at stage zero.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I think if this spot was in a different part of my body, I wouldn’t have noticed how quickly it was changing and it could have been a very different outcome for me,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within weeks of her diagnosis, Mills underwent Mohs surgery at Mount Sinai. The highly technical procedure involves removing skin in layers, examining each under a microscope until all the cancer cells are gone while preserving as much healthy tissue as possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dr. Jesse Lewin removed Mills’ melanoma with minimal scarring. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Mount Sinai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Melanoma has cells that can be visible on slides under the microscope extending beyond what you can be see with the naked eye,” Lewin said. “If cells are left behind the melanoma can get deeper or spread to lymph nodes.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though the original spot was tiny — no bigger than the top of a push pin — by the time Lewin was done removing the cancer, Mills had a wound about the size of a quarter on her face.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-pullquote"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You look at your skin every day. If you sense something is wrong, no one is going to judge you for going to the doctor and having it looked at.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Jacqueline Mills&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It took about a year for the wound to fully heal and the scar to fade. To minimize it, she turned to laser treatments and silicone scar cream.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“Now most people can’t even really tell that I have a scar,” Mills said. “The only people that know are the people that knew me at the time, it’s healed really, really nicely.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Scan it, spot it, stop it&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now 34 and cancer-free, Mills sees the dermatologist twice a year and uses advanced technologies like the Vectra scan to monitor any changes in her skin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“When you get a full body yearly scan, you’re relying on your dermatologist to record and remember your moles and your spots from the year before,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Vectra WB360 scan, by contrast, is a 3D whole-body imaging system with more than 40 cameras that can document all of your freckles, moles and other growths in a matter of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Vectra body scanner at Mount Sinai is the only device of its kind in New York City.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;“If you’re someone with a skin type that has a lot of spots, this is a really good option because it’s an added layer of protection,” Mills said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Now you can have the doctor’s eyes and a computerized scan of your entire body, which can measure the size and the pigment and the type of spots that you have and compare them from year to year,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re average risk for skin cancer, get a full head-to-toe check by a dermatologist once a year, according to Lewin. But if you’ve got a history, he recommends going twice.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But you don’t have to wait for your annual appointment to stay on top of your skin.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Doctors are an important tool, but you are your first line of defense when it comes to dermatology,” Mills said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Doctors recommend that people regularly conduct self-exams for melanoma. &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“You look at your skin every day. If you sense something is wrong, no one is going to judge you for going to the doctor and having it looked at,” she added. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you run into a dismissive provider like Mills did, don’t back down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Hesitation when it comes to melanoma could be the difference between a simple removal and getting chemotherapy, because that’s how quickly it moves and how deadly it is,” Mills said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lewin echoed her warning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Trust your gut — if a lesion on your skin is new or changing and you are concerned, see a dermatologist,” he said. “If you remain concerned after seeing one doctor, get a second opinion. Because [Mills] did that, it saved her life.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;If you’ve had melanoma before, you are more likely to develop it again.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The dark side of sun kissed&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Melanoma makes up just 1% of all skin cancers, but it causes the vast majority of skin cancer deaths, according to the ACS.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;In 2025, the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/melanoma-skin-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;group estimates&lt;/a&gt; that about 104,960 new melanomas will be diagnosed in the US, and roughly 8,430 Americans will die from it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While melanoma risk increases with age, &lt;a href="https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/112435" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;studies show&lt;/a&gt; that rates among children, adolescents and young adults have increased by more than 250% over the past four decades. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Soaking up UV rays — whether from the sun or tanning beds — is a major risk factor for melanoma. Having a lot of moles or lighter skin, hair or eyes increases your chances, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your odds also go up if you have a weakened immune system or a family history of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

But it can also happen right in the kitchen, through simple daily habits that you likely have a lot of control over.

    &lt;p&gt;“Most people in the UK have blood pressure that’s higher than the ideal, but as a general guide, &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/heart-health/midlife-blood-pressure-explained-normal-worry-do/"&gt;normal blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; is considered to be between 90/60mmHg and 120/80mmHg,” says Prof MacGregor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what are the proven ways of reducing blood pressure? The best methods to reduce blood pressure, according to the experts, are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="#medication"&gt;Medication&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="#cut-back-on-salt"&gt;Cut back on salt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="#foods-that-reduce-blood-pressure"&gt;Eat potassium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="#exercise-more"&gt;Exercise more&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="#lose-weight-"&gt;Lose weight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="#cut-back-on-alcohol"&gt;Cut back on alcohol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="#quit-smoking-and-vaping"&gt;Quit smoking – and vaping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="#prioritise-sleep"&gt;Prioritise sleep&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="#know-your-supplements-"&gt;Supplements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="#monitor-your-blood-pressure-at-home"&gt;Monitor your blood pressure at home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, we have very effective ways of &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/ageing/numbers-controlling-midlife-health-how-change/"&gt;reducing blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; with four main types of medicine. “They reduce blood pressure through different mechanisms and that’s important because your body will try to stop it working,” says MacGregor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One tablet might reduce the pressure through one mechanism, and then if your body manages to block it, you might be prescribed another pill that works through a different mechanism. If you’re given two tablets that work in different ways, that’s more effective than one, and if you’re on three, that can be more effective than two.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The four main types are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)&lt;/strong&gt; – both work by controlling the hormones that help relax and widen the blood vessels, which &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/heart-health/6-life-changing-benefits-of-taking-your-blood-pressure/"&gt;in turn lowers&lt;/a&gt; the pressure&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thiazide diuretics&lt;/strong&gt; – which removes excess fluid from the body&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) – &lt;/strong&gt;prevent calcium from entering the cells of the heart and arteries (since calcium causes them to contract more strongly), allowing blood vessels to relax and open.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side effects for some include dizziness &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/body/different-types-headaches-how-to-treat-migraines/"&gt;and headaches&lt;/a&gt;. “Some people won’t have any side effects. It depends on the drug and the person, and also whether they are on any other medicines,” says Ruth Goss, a senior cardiac nurse with the British Heart Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The long-term health consequences of uncontrolled high blood pressure are much worse. If you have any concerns about your medication, don’t alter the dose or stop taking it. Talk to your GP,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is absolutely key – the more salt you eat, the higher your blood pressure will be. Even if you are on blood pressure medication, a salty diet can make it work less effectively. &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/heart-health/how-to-add-flavour-without-raising-your-blood-pressure/"&gt;Reducing your salt intake&lt;/a&gt; will have an impact quickly too – often within weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though we need a small amount of salt to stay healthy – about 4 grams each day – we should eat no more than 6g, or one level teaspoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us eat too much. Roughly 75 per cent is from processed foods, 15 per cent is added during cooking or before eating (so remove the salt cellar from the table), and 10 per cent is found naturally in food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to processed foods, check labels carefully for salt or sodium – two loaves of bread or boxes of cereal made by the same company can contain wildly different quantities. “When buying tinned fish, pulses or vegetables, opt for the ones in water over brine,” says Kate Llewellyn-Waters, author, nutritionist and resident expert on TV programme You Are What You Eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Know your &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/nutrition/diet/everyday-foods-sneaking-salt-diet-11-easy-ways-cut/"&gt;high-salt items&lt;/a&gt;, these are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ketchup&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Soy sauce&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gravy granules&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pocessed meats&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pickles&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ready meals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Takeaways&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opting for unsalted butter is one example of a simple swap you can make. The FoodSwitch app allows you to scan the barcodes of food and drink and instantly see whether they are high, medium or low in salt. It also suggests healthier alternative products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When cooking, one of the most effective tips to retrain your taste buds is to add &lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health-fitness/conditions/heart-health/herbs-spices-reduce-blood-pressure-heart-disease-use-meals-diet-2022/"&gt;herbs or spices&lt;/a&gt; in place of salt,” says Llewellyn-Waters. Lemon juice, cumin, shallots and fresh or dried herbs will all add flavour.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that salt preference is an acquired taste that can be unlearned. It takes six to eight weeks to adjust to much lower quantities – after that, you’ll never enjoy a pretzel again.&lt;/p&gt;

This rose from just 2.5 per cent one month before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WHO declared the NB.1.8.1 strain a “variant under monitoring” on 23 May, which means scientists believe it could potentially affect the behaviour of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why has there been a surge in new cases? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lara Herrero, a virologist from Griffith University in Australia, suspects that NB.1.8.1 spreads more easily than other variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Using lab-based models, researchers found NB.1.8.1 had the strongest binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor of several variants tested, suggesting it may infect cells more efficiently than earlier strains,” Dr Herrero wrote last month in &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 eGBSeb"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/03/16/iStock-1303713798.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/03/16/iStock-1303713798.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/03/16/iStock-1303713798.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The Covid vaccines protect people from the worst effects of the illness" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-96465"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;The Covid vaccines protect people from the worst effects of the illness&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Chun Tang, GP at Pall Mall Medical, added: “NB.1.8.1 isn’t too different from the Omicron variant, but it does have some tweaks to its spike protein, which might make it spread a bit more easily or slip past some of our existing immunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That said, early signs suggest it doesn’t seem to cause more serious illness, but of course, we’re still learning more about it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Its spread has been identified in around 22 countries,” said Dr Naveed Asif, GP at The London General Practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The WHO assesses the additional risk to the global public as currently low, and existing Covid-19 &lt;a href="/topic/vaccines"&gt;vaccines&lt;/a&gt; are considered effective in preventing severe disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Nimbus does appear to be more transmissible than previous variants, with notable increases reported in India, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Thailand, notes Dr Asif.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Common symptoms of the NB.1.8.1 variant include a severe sore throat. fatigue, mild cough, fever, muscle aches and congestion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has also been reported that some patients have experienced gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and diarrhoea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Healthcare experts have stressed, however, that there is no evidence that the new strain is more deadly or serious than previous variants, and that current Covid vaccines are expected to remain effective and protect anyone infected from severe illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 09:33:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxNeWc5MFU4TUtlSUw4WXMyN3dQVzNxeXpsY1lJWWJ2SlB4czl3UkF5UFo0WDdZSzJqbnczXzhNWmNicExlVHFMX0tmV1RRTEJhdkQwNXEwdjBqcWVtbEhpZ29XVE1IdTJoMHRSTWJreF9YVmUteFFXME9lVktldGJDaDQtMGJLYmUwNW4xZ2FMaFczanJuSUJqSDVIWkI1UHJVYmM0</guid></item><item><title>暂停细胞死亡（称为坏死）可能是抵抗衰老过程的秘诀- Earth.com | Pausing cell death, known as necrosis, may be the secret to defying the aging process - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipAFBVV95cUxOcWkydlNIWllwN0FhWmxvTms0a09uYS1Xa2dDWGRDVnh4eEh2dGJHNERqZ1U0TzI4ZHZ1ZmxzamQ2aVo3RXJRekF0MVJiOGQ0ZExhYlVmOFpMZWN2NWF5bkRVenlHWEpqZmdFdjAtNWdKZi1uX1NHMjQ1WGZReDVMbGJ4ZGVzcXlRWVh3aE1OYVRHODZmbEg3aEpRa3M2QWZJdHBtcQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aging has long been viewed as a slow and inevitable decline. But new research suggests that hidden deep within the body’s cellular processes, there may be a crucial trigger point – one that could be changed, paused, or even reversed. The process in question is necrosis, a form of uncontrolled cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study by researchers from University College London (&lt;a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCL&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="https://www.linkgevity.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;LinkGevity&lt;/a&gt;, and the European Space Agency (&lt;a href="https://www.esa.int" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ESA&lt;/a&gt;) places necrosis at the center of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/organ-aging-can-predict-diseases-decades-in-advance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt; and disease. The paper suggests that necrosis might not just be a consequence of damage. It might be a cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-necrosis-may-be-the-trigger-of-aging"&gt;Necrosis may be the trigger of aging&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Necrosis is a chaotic form of cell death caused by stress, infection, or injury. Unlike controlled cell death, it damages nearby tissues and triggers inflammation. The study suggests necrosis is not just a final event but an active driver of aging and chronic &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/healthy-aging-how-some-people-live-past-100-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nobody really likes talking about death, even cell death, which is perhaps why the physiology of death is so poorly understood. And in a way necrosis is death,” noted Dr. Keith Siew from the UCL Centre for Kidney &amp;amp; Bladder Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If enough cells die, then tissues die, then we die. The question is what would happen if we could pause or stop necrosis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-chaotic-cell-death-spreads-damage"&gt;Chaotic cell death spreads damage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cells are the building blocks of all living organisms. Their death is &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/daily-doctor-recommended-regimen-that-could-slow-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;natural&lt;/a&gt; and necessary, but only when it happens in a regulated way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In healthy systems, cells are replaced in a clean and controlled fashion. This process, known as apoptosis, helps organs regenerate and stay functional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Necrosis is different. It happens without order or purpose. When it occurs, cells rupture and spill their contents into surrounding tissue. This creates inflammation, spreads damage, and accelerates aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Necrosis remains one of the last frontiers in medicine – a common thread across &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/universal-rule-of-biology-sai-proposed-to-explain-aging-and-how-to-control-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt;, disease, space biology, and scientific progress itself,” said Dr. Carina Kern, lead author of the study and CEO of LinkGevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-calcium-imbalance-causes-cell-collapse"&gt;Calcium imbalance causes cell collapse&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of necrosis is calcium, a mineral that helps regulate cell function. Normally, cells maintain much higher calcium levels outside their membranes than inside. This gradient helps control vital activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/08111129/necrosis_pausing-cell-death_anti-aging-study_credit-Linkgevity_1m.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://cff2.earth.com/uploads/2025/06/08111137/necrosis_pausing-cell-death_anti-aging-study_credit-Linkgevity_1s.webp" alt="Illustration of a healthy cell (left) alongside a cell that has been affected by necrosis (right).

Click image to enlarge. Credit: LinkGevity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When calcium floods in, the cell collapses, spills toxins, and triggers harmful inflammation. “When cells die, it’s not always a peaceful process for the neighbors,” Dr. Siew noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-toxic-cell-death-links-diseases"&gt;Toxic cell death links diseases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Necrosis triggers a domino &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/random-dna-mutations-shape-biological-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;effect&lt;/a&gt;. As toxic materials spread, nearby cells are affected. This leads to more cell death, more inflammation, and a growing spiral of decline. Over time, the body becomes less able to repair itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study draws connections between necrosis and several chronic conditions. These include Alzheimer’s, heart disease, and kidney failure. These diseases are often seen as unrelated, but researchers argue they share a common thread: necrosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Necrosis has been hiding in plain sight. As a final stage of cell death, it’s been largely overlooked. But mounting evidence shows it’s far more than an endpoint. It’s a central mechanism through which systemic degeneration not only arises but also spreads,” noted Dr. Kern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That makes it a critical point of convergence across many diseases. If we can target necrosis, we could unlock entirely new ways to treat conditions ranging from kidney failure to cardiac disease, neuro-degeneration, and even aging itself.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-cell-death-harms-kidneys-as-we-age"&gt;Cell death harms kidneys as we age&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among all the organs affected by necrosis, the kidneys may suffer the most. They filter blood, regulate fluid levels, and support other systems. As people age, these functions often falter. Nearly half of those over 75 show signs of kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study highlights how necrosis lies at the center of this decline. Stressors such as low oxygen, oxidative stress, and toxin buildup all lead to necrosis in kidney tissues. Once it begins, it fuels a feedback loop that becomes hard to stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With kidney disease, there’s no one underlying reason that the kidneys fail. It could be a lack of oxygen, inflammation, oxidative stress, a build-up of toxins, and so on,” Dr. Siew explained&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All of these stressors eventually lead to necrosis, which initiates a positive feedback loop that spirals out of control, leading to kidney failure. We can’t stop all of these stressors, but if you could intervene at the point of necrosis, you’d effectively achieve the same result.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-aging-in-space"&gt;Aging in space&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications of necrosis extend far beyond Earth. In space, astronauts face conditions that mimic and accelerate aging. Low gravity and cosmic radiation stress the body. Muscles waste away, bones weaken, and organs begin to fail more quickly than on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Dr. Siew worked on a study that identified the human kidney as a major vulnerability during spaceflight. Necrosis appeared to play a central role. The body’s inability to manage stress in space could threaten the success of long-term missions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Damian Bailey is a professor of physiology and biochemistry at the &lt;a href="https://www.southwales.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of South Wales&lt;/a&gt; and Chair of the ESA Life Sciences Working Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Targeting necrosis offers potential to not only transform longevity on Earth but also push the frontiers of space exploration,” noted Professor Bailey. “In space, the same factors that cause aging on Earth are made worse by cosmic radiation and microgravity – speeding up degeneration dramatically.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-stopping-cell-death-to-support-healing"&gt;Stopping cell death to support healing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Necrosis in vital organs triggers damage cycles that slow healing and reduce recovery capacity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In many age-related diseases – affecting diverse organs such as the lungs, kidneys, liver, brain, and cardiovascular system – relentless cascades of necrosis fuel the progression of disease,” explained Dr. Kern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is often alongside impaired healing that leads to fibrosis, inflammation and damaged cells. Each cascade triggers and amplifies the next.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If we could prevent necrosis, even temporarily, we would be shutting down these destructive cycles at their source, enabling normal physiological processes and cell division to resume – and potentially even allowing for regeneration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41388-025-03431-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oncogene&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read? &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 09:17:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxOcWkydlNIWllwN0FhWmxvTms0a09uYS1Xa2dDWGRDVnh4eEh2dGJHNERqZ1U0TzI4ZHZ1ZmxzamQ2aVo3RXJRekF0MVJiOGQ0ZExhYlVmOFpMZWN2NWF5bkRVenlHWEpqZmdFdjAtNWdKZi1uX1NHMjQ1WGZReDVMbGJ4ZGVzcXlRWVh3aE1OYVRHODZmbEg3aEpRa3M2QWZJdHBtcQ</guid></item><item><title>我尝试了“每天超过10,000步”的步行方法–这就是为什么我是一个粉丝-独立报 | I tried the walking method ‘better than 10,000 steps per day’ – this is why I’m a fan - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPVVhieFBnU040SDlCcjNRZVBjSDdkbmtscVhrRmNUV2VmMXBSV2poaW0tazZQWU55aEhBQ3lTOERvRzItMUZnWm1KOEtZQUd5WEN1YkF6ZVktWHBBYVhyMzZlaXFYRDZsYlptd25zYTJGREtoS1Q4Q24xMHdHdVVFLXZ0ZEl5VmFweXdZc3BzOXdfcDNmekZIUnRZRWxoR2VRdVBObVhxTGJBY0k?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 gryCYY sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 dFpFuY"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 dmMyEN"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 fXvmgM"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 juUDRT"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cqPbFA"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 rAFIl sc-hez36s-16 jZSKtc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 PdmgT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 hJPJVF"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 lcJUSj"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 laZbyn"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 cKWiEj"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

Treating &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/10k-steps-a-day-walking-b2735565.html"&gt;10,000 steps per day&lt;/a&gt; as the gold standard for a healthy lifestyle is far more contentious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number stems from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign for a pedometer called the Manpo-Kei, or “10,000 steps metre”. It’s a nice round number, but it’s not one identified by science as the holy grail for health – a 2023 study by the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.ugr.es/en/about/news/how-many-steps-take-each-day-reduce-risk-premature-death8000"&gt;University of Granada&lt;/a&gt; suggests that, while more is better, 8,000 is sufficient “to significantly reduce the risk of premature death”​​. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/topic/walking"&gt;Walking&lt;/a&gt; 10,000 steps also takes a fair old while. Even at a decent nick, this task is likely to take you upwards of 90 minutes each day, making it a struggle for busy folks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1kv918u-0 cDsnpW"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-hKDTPf hmBpZX"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7Ehvq-bm6I"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, an alternative walking protocol – colloquially termed “Japanese walking” due to its country of origin – has stepped into the spotlight online. It takes just 30 minutes per day, with fitness coach and content creator &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/coacheugeneteo/?hl=en"&gt;Eugene Teo&lt;/a&gt; claiming it offers “10 times the benefits” of walking 10,000 steps per day in his viral video above. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a fitness writer, I’ve covered walking extensively, finding it’s one of the best ways to help people of all fitness levels introduce more movement into their regular routine. So, intrigued, I endeavoured to try “Japanese walking” and find out if the impressive health claims around it held water.&lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/K7Ehvq-bm6I"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to try the ‘Japanese walking’ method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete the sequence below five times without any breaks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-kk992l-0 sc-w27hnf-1 dDVXDN jHvNZk"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three minutes of walking at a low intensity (40 per cent peak aerobic capacity, or a relaxed pace) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three minutes of walking at a high intensity (70 per cent peak aerobic capacity, or a brisk pace) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of Japanese walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “Japanese walking” protocol comes from a study published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17605959/"&gt;Mayo Clinic Proceedings&lt;/a&gt; journal in 2007. It was designed to test whether high-intensity interval walking training (IWT) can offer greater benefits than moderate-intensity continuous walking training, in terms of improving thigh muscle strength, peak aerobic capacity (the maximum amount of oxygen you can take in and use during exercise) and blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over five months, 60 men and 186 women with an average age of 63 were divided into three groups; no walking training, IWT and CWT (continuous walking training). The CWT group was instructed to walk at 50 per cent of their peak aerobic capacity (a fairly slow pace) and take 8,000 or more steps per day at least four times per week. The IWT group was told to complete the protocol above, four or more times per week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among participants who met these conditions, those in the IWT group saw a 13 per cent increase in isometric knee flexion, a 17 per cent increase in isometric knee flexion, and an eight per cent increase in peak aerobic capacity for walking. This was “significantly greater than the increases observed in the moderate-intensity continuous walking training group”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also found a greater reduction in resting systolic blood pressure in the IWT group, despite the fact they didn’t spend as much time walking each week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conclusion states: “high-intensity interval walking may protect against age-associated increases in blood pressure and decreases in thigh muscle strength and peak aerobic capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/japanese-walking-trend-weight-loss-b2759539.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The latest walking trend that could help burn more calories and lower blood pressure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/japanese-walking-trend-weight-loss-b2759539.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 djDghv"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/04/8/36/Walking-is-one-of-the-most-accessible-forms-of-movement-offering-impressive-health-benefits.jpeg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Walking is one of the most accessible forms of movement, offering impressive health benefits" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-258272"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Walking is one of the most accessible forms of movement, offering impressive health benefits&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (David Lovelady)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What happened when I tried Japanese walking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a full science lab set up at home; what I do have is two legs, a &lt;a href="/extras/indybest/outdoor-activity/sports-equipment-accessories/best-garmin-watch-b1903982.html"&gt;Garmin watch&lt;/a&gt; and a lot of walking experience, so I decided to put these to good use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During my Monday lunch break, I took my dog for a 30-minute walk as normal. Then, at 1pm the following day, I tried the “Japanese walking” method on the same looped route, setting my Garmin Vivoactive to record both sessions and taking note of any subjective changes I felt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My usual 30-minute walk saw me accrue nearly 3,000 steps, covering 2.12km at an average speed of 14min 10sec per kilometre. My heart rate averaged 85bpm, remaining fairly constant throughout, and I burned an estimated 157 calories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As anyone who has owned a dog might expect, there was a good deal of stopping and starting to inspect particularly interesting trees and bollards, and I defaulted to a fairly casual pace amid a busy work day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Japanese walking protocol, my numbers looked a bit different, with my fast pace falling just below 120 steps per minute and my slow pace a few shy of 100 steps per minute. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I travelled significantly further, covering 2.94km and 3,500 steps at an average speed of 10min 12sec per kilometre. My average heart rate came out very similar (86bpm) but there were noticeable peaks (104bpm) and troughs in line with the high- and low-speed intervals. My estimated calorie burn was also significantly higher: 211. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/how-many-steps-a-day-cancer-risk-b2756669.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many steps to take each day to slash your risk of cancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/health-and-families/how-many-steps-a-day-cancer-risk-b2756669.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of the Japanese walking method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that walking faster, or sprinkling more intensity into your exercise, holds greater benefits is nothing new. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialist in walking for health, &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://education.ua.edu/about/directory/faculty-directory/elroy-aguiar/"&gt;Dr Elroy Aguiar&lt;/a&gt;, is an assistant professor at the University of Alabama’s department of kinesiology. He was the lead author on a 2024 paper published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/sms.14762"&gt;Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports&lt;/a&gt;, which correlated as little as one minute of high-intensity activity with improved health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of the really interesting findings from our paper was that, if you look at people’s highest one minute of activity across each day, averaged across the monitoring period, that was a very strong signal for whether they had one or more metabolic syndrome risk factors [elevated waist circumference, high triglycerides, low HDL (or “good” cholesterol), high blood pressure and high blood sugar] present,” he tells me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another series of studies he worked on, featured in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29858465/"&gt;British Journal of Sports Medicine&lt;/a&gt;, pointed to the fact that “if you walk at a cadence of about 100 steps per minute, that’s equivalent to what’s called ‘moderate-intensity’, and all of the research in this area suggests that most of the benefits [of walking] accumulate at a moderate or higher intensity”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, completing the Japanese walking method four times per week leaves you half-an-hour away from the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity"&gt;World Health Organisation’s&lt;/a&gt; “global recommendations of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week”. Add a couple of short full-body &lt;a href="/topic/strength-training"&gt;strength training&lt;/a&gt; sessions into the mix and you have a decent &lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/short-workouts-plan-fitness-dan-john-b2737277.html"&gt;minimalist workout plan&lt;/a&gt; for beginners. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/step-count-walking-benefits-10000-day-b2739534.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How your step count became the ultimate modern humblebrag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="/life-style/step-count-walking-benefits-10000-day-b2739534.html"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="3" class="sc-482ou5-0 eVrEhv"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/13/09/Untitled-design-%2889%29.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/13/09/Untitled-design-%2889%29.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/13/09/Untitled-design-%2889%29.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Completing the ‘Japanese walking’ method a few times each week sets you well on your way to hitting the World Health Organisation’s weekly physical activity guidelines" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-258273"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;Completing the ‘Japanese walking’ method a few times each week sets you well on your way to hitting the World Health Organisation’s weekly physical activity guidelines&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Harry Bullmore/The Independent)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 dDVXDN"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Potential drawbacks of the Japanese Walking method&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the information above paints the Japanese walking method in a favourable light – as it should, with the protocol delivering impressive results in a non-intimidating time-span. However, if we are questioning the claim that it is “better” than walking 10,000 steps a day, there are a few further areas to consider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, Dr Aguiar’s 2024 paper supported the idea that the “best” walking method for reducing metabolic risk factors involves a combination of high volume (number of steps) and high intensity (walking speed). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Accumulating a high volume of walking throughout the day [8,000-plus steps], then focussing on at least 30 minutes of faster walking or jogging, would be a way to move the metrics in a positive direction and lower your metrics for each of the [metabolic syndrome] risk factors,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I racked up a little over 3,500 steps when trying the Japanese Walking method – less than half of the 8,000 daily steps research has repeatedly linked to many favourable health outcomes, and short of the 5,000 mark often viewed as the threshold for a sedentary lifestyle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this method as part, rather than all, of your daily steps could be a better approach for achieving your health goals. However, if you only have 30 minutes per day free, it still offers dramatically more benefits than not moving at all, and improved return on investment over a regular 30-minute walk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another area where the Japanese walking method loses out to walking 10,000 steps per day is movement regularity. While the former involves a concentrated 30-minute dose of activity, the latter can be spread throughout the day, encouraging you to abandon your office chair and sofa more often. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A 10-year study of 8,000 people, published in the &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30551177/"&gt;American Journal of Epidemiology&lt;/a&gt;, found that those replaced 30 minutes of daily sitting with light activity had a 17 per cent lower risk of dying in that period. This even applied if they accrued these 30 minutes across short intervals throughout the day – hence why your smartwatch is constantly sending you reminders to stand up and move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular movement can also help maintain mobility and reduce stiffness in our joints and muscles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we’re dealing with an adaptation from stillness, movement is the answer, so any movement is better than just being still,” movement mechanics expert and &lt;a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.thetrainingstimulus.com/"&gt;The Training Stimulus&lt;/a&gt; founder Ash Grossmann summarises. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final factor to consider is enjoyment. By adding a rigid framework, Japanese walking ensures intensity. However, it also meant I was unable to stop and chat to people in the park or appreciate my surroundings to the same extent. For me, this lowered the stress-busting potential of my walk, sacrificing some of the usual mental health benefits of walking for physical ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/news/health/fart-walk-benefits-type-2-diabetes-cancer-b2744886.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the heck is a fart walk?

But if you can fit one or two quick full-body strength training sessions, regular aerobic activity (like walking) and an occasional dash of more intense exercise into each week, it will stand you in very good stead. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking is among the most accessible forms of exercise there is, lowering the barrier to entry for exercise for billions of people, which is why I’m always keen to promote it. However, in the modern world, even finding time for a quick walk can be tricky for particularly busy individuals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Japanese walking method provides a time-savvy way to enjoy many of the benefits of a greater volume of daily walking. Sure, you could enjoy higher-intensity exercise in any number of other forms, from cycling to a HIIT workout, but walking remains the most efficient – you don’t even need a change of clothes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So should you try it? Yes, especially if you’re short on time and looking for a way to squeeze health-boosting movement into your day. And should you stick with it? This depends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you enjoy this framework, or find it’s something you can stick to with a good degree of regularity, that’s the ticket to a sustainable movement habit and the many health benefits that come from it. If not, look for an alternative form of moderate- to high-intensity exercise that you find fun, and commit to this instead – consistency is the key to long-term results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/health-and-fitness/walking-10000-steps-a-day-calories-fitness-b2650416.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Walking 10,000 steps day might not matter if you don’t do this one thing, according to an expert&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 09:04:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPVVhieFBnU040SDlCcjNRZVBjSDdkbmtscVhrRmNUV2VmMXBSV2poaW0tazZQWU55aEhBQ3lTOERvRzItMUZnWm1KOEtZQUd5WEN1YkF6ZVktWHBBYVhyMzZlaXFYRDZsYlptd25zYTJGREtoS1Q4Q24xMHdHdVVFLXZ0ZEl5VmFweXdZc3BzOXdfcDNmekZIUnRZRWxoR2VRdVBObVhxTGJBY0k</guid></item><item><title>鸡胸肉有多健康？ -《纽约时报》 | How Healthy Is Chicken Breast? - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxQMGM1d0VzaVowU3V3NFV0amFWejMzcjB0enptVC1hdFFhVk1zTEdZTEc4ZmJLRTVYcFN5d0dEY2ZtXzY1eUktOHlfSi0zLVNmTDh1YlZkQ3RYV1ZRV25jUjc1V3ROeWlab2xuV0JJODJ6bTdIbXdyQ3E0blM1Vm9lOE1xcVljUlAycmwzYUZYZXk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;All cuts of chicken are great for you, but on a number of metrics, the humble breast takes top prize. Along with containing nutrients that are involved in repairing the body’s tissues, building immunity and boosting energy, chicken breast is lower in saturated fat than thighs, legs and wings, making it a smart choice for people concerned about their heart health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Here are a few ways that chicken breast benefits your body, along with some recipes from &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/465934-chicken-breast-recipes" title=""&gt;New York Times Cooking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-1u37br4 eoo0vm40" id="link-26284069"&gt;It’s one of the best food sources of protein.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;On a per-calorie basis, there aren’t many whole foods richer in protein than chicken breast. “You’d have to eat protein powder to get more protein,” said Dave Bridges, a biochemist and associate professor of nutritional sciences at the University of Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;There are no carbohydrates and little fat in chicken breast, especially if you remove the skin, said Heidi Silver, the director of the Diet, Body Composition and Metabolism Core at Vanderbilt University. One &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-details/331960/nutrients" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;3.5-ounce serving&lt;/a&gt; of boneless, skinless chicken breast contains about 160 calories and 32 grams of protein.

&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Han, a geriatrician and addiction medicine specialist at the University of California-San Diego, tells his students a cautionary tale about a 76-year-old patient who, like many older people, struggled with insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;







&lt;p&gt;“She had problems falling asleep, and she’d wake up in the middle of the night,” he said. “So her daughter brought her some sleep gummies” — edible cannabis candies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“She tried a gummy after dinner and waited half an hour,” Han said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Feeling no effects, she took another gummy, then one more — a total of four over several hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Han advises patients who are trying cannabis to “start low; go slow,” beginning with products that contain just 1 or 2.5 milligrams of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the psychoactive ingredient that many cannabis products contain. Each of the four gummies this patient took, however, contained 10 milligrams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The woman started experiencing intense anxiety and heart palpitations. A young person might have shrugged off such symptoms, but this patient had high blood pressure and atrial fibrillation, a heart arrhythmia. Frightened, she went to an emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Lab tests and a cardiac work-up determined the woman wasn’t having a heart attack, and the staff sent her home. Her only lingering symptom was embarrassment, Han said. But what if she’d grown dizzy or lightheaded and was hurt in a fall? He said he has had patients injured in falls or while driving after using cannabis. What if the cannabis had interacted with the prescription drugs she took?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“As a geriatrician, it gives me pause,” Han said. “Our brains are more sensitive to psychoactive substances as we age.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thirty-nine states and the District of Columbia now &lt;a href="https://www.ncsl.org/health/state-medical-cannabis-laws"&gt;allow cannabis use&lt;/a&gt; for medical reasons, and in 24 of those states, as well as the district, &lt;a href="https://covercannabis.com/blog/where-is-marijuana-legal/#:~:text=Which%20States%20Have%20Legalized%20Recreational,nearly%20half%20of%20the%20country."&gt;recreational use&lt;/a&gt; is also legal. As older adults’ use climbs, “the benefits are still unclear,” Han said. “But we’re seeing more evidence of potential harms.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A wave of recent research points to reasons for concern for older users, with cannabis-related emergency room visits and hospitalizations rising, and a Canadian study finding an association between such acute care and subsequent dementia. Older people are more apt than younger ones to try cannabis for therapeutic reasons: to relieve chronic pain, insomnia, or mental health issues, though evidence of its effectiveness in addressing those conditions remains thin, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.1156?guestAccessKey=6fb7097a-4590-4b78-b8a5-b21f5b00def4&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=060225"&gt;analysis of national survey data&lt;/a&gt; published June 2 in the medical journal JAMA, Han and his colleagues reported that “current” cannabis use (defined as use within the previous month) had jumped among adults age 65 or older to 7% of respondents in 2023, from 4.8% in 2021. In 2005, he pointed out, fewer than 1% of older adults reported using cannabis in the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s driving the increase? Experts cite the steady march of state legalization — use by older people is highest in those states — while surveys show that the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8440375/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;perceived risk&lt;/a&gt; of cannabis use has declined. One national survey found that a growing &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37566411/"&gt;proportion of American adults — 44% in 2021 — erroneously thought&lt;/a&gt; it safer to smoke cannabis daily than cigarettes. The authors of the study, in JAMA Network Open, noted that “these views do not reflect the existing science on cannabis and tobacco smoke.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cannabis industry also markets its products to older adults. The Trulieve chain gives a 10% discount, both in stores and online, to those it calls “wisdom” customers, 55 or older. Rise Dispensaries ran a yearlong cannabis education and empowerment program for two senior centers in Paterson, New Jersey, including field trips to its dispensary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The industry has many satisfied older customers. Liz Logan, 67, a freelance writer in Bronxville, New York, had grappled with sleep problems and anxiety for years, but the conditions grew particularly debilitating two years ago, as her husband was dying of Parkinson’s disease. “I’d frequently be awake until 5 or 6 in the morning,” she said. “It makes you crazy.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking online for edible cannabis products, Logan found that gummies containing cannabidiol, known as CBD, alone didn’t help, but those with 10 milligrams of THC did the trick without noticeable side effects. “I don’t worry about sleep anymore,” she said. “I’ve solved a lifelong problem.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But studies in the United States and Canada, which &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/programs/engaging-cannabis-legalization-regulation-canada-taking-stock-progress/document.html"&gt;legalized nonmedical cannabis&lt;/a&gt; use for adults nationally in 2018, show climbing rates of cannabis-related health care use among older people, both in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2820100"&gt;outpatient settings&lt;/a&gt; and in hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In California, for instance, cannabis-related &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36622838/"&gt;emergency room visits&lt;/a&gt; by those 65 or older rose, to 395 per 100,000 visits in 2019 from about 21 in 2005. In Ontario, acute care (meaning emergency visits or hospital admissions) resulting from cannabis use increased fivefold in middle-aged adults from 2008 to 2021, and more than &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40227745/"&gt;26 times among those 65 and up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s not reflective of everyone who’s using cannabis,” cautioned Daniel Myran, an investigator at the Bruyère Health Research Institute in Ottawa and lead author of the Ontario study. “It’s capturing people with more severe patterns.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But since other studies have shown &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39112780/"&gt;increased cardiac risk&lt;/a&gt; among some cannabis users with heart disease or diabetes, “there’s a number of warning signals,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, a disturbing proportion of older veterans who currently use cannabis &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2833976"&gt;screen positive for cannabis use disorder&lt;/a&gt;, a recent JAMA Network Open study found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As with other substance use disorders, such patients “can tolerate high amounts,” said the lead author, Vira Pravosud, a cannabis researcher at the Northern California Institute for Research and Education. “They continue using even if it interferes with their social or work or family obligations” and may experience withdrawal if they stop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among 4,500 older veterans (with an average age of 73) seeking care at Department of Veterans Affairs health facilities, &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250519/Study-reveals-high-rates-of-cannabis-use-disorder-in-older-US-veterans.aspx"&gt;researchers found&lt;/a&gt; that more than 10% had reported cannabis use within the previous 30 days. Of those, 36% fit the criteria for mild, moderate, or severe &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9590423/#:~:text=DSM-5%20CUD%20criteria%20include,6)%20social%2C%20occupational%2C%20or"&gt;cannabis use disorder&lt;/a&gt;, as established in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;VA patients differ from the general population, Pravosud noted. They are much more likely to report substance misuse and have “higher rates of chronic diseases and disabilities, and mental health conditions like PTSD” that could lead to self-medication, she said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Current VA policies don’t require clinicians to ask patients about cannabis use. Pravosud thinks that they should.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, “there’s increasing evidence of a potential effect on memory and cognition,” said Myran, citing his team’s study of Ontario patients with cannabis-related conditions going to emergency departments or being admitted to hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compared with others of the same age and sex who were seeking care for other reasons, &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/neurology/dementia/115116"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt; these patients (ages 45 to 105) had 1.5 times the risk of a dementia diagnosis within five years, and 3.9 times the risk of that for the general population.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even after adjusting for chronic health conditions and sociodemographic factors, those seeking acute care resulting from cannabis use had a 23% &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40227745/"&gt;higher dementia risk&lt;/a&gt; than patients with noncannabis-related ailments, and a 72% higher risk than the general population.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;None of these studies were randomized clinical trials, the researchers pointed out; they were observational and could not ascertain causality. Some cannabis research doesn’t specify whether users are smoking, vaping, ingesting or rubbing topical cannabis on aching joints; other studies lack relevant demographic information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s very frustrating that we’re not able to provide more individual guidance on safer modes of consumption, and on amounts of use that seem lower-risk,” Myran said. “It just highlights that the rapid expansion of regular cannabis use in North America is outpacing our knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, given the health vulnerabilities of older people, and the far greater potency of current cannabis products compared with the weed of their youth, he and other researchers urge caution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If you view cannabis as a medicine, you should be open to the idea that there are groups who probably shouldn’t use it and that there are potential adverse effects from it,” he said. “Because that is true of all medicines.”&lt;/p&gt;

Some come with hidden chemicals your skin won't thank you for. Choose wisely, read the label, and protect your skin the right way," Dr. Alok Chopra wrote in the caption.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the video, Dr. Chopra warns, "Your sunscreen could be silently harming your hormones. Most commercial &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/regular-sunscreens-not-working-here-s-why-gel-sunscreens-are-better-plus-best-options-to-try-101744110723536.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="sunscreens"&gt;sunscreens&lt;/a&gt; are loaded with endocrine disruptors and cancer-causing chemicals. When you apply them to your skin, they get absorbed into your bloodstream. So, before buying sunscreen, you must read the ingredients carefully."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sharing a list of harmful ingredients, he adds, "If you see oxybenzone, methoxycinnamate, or avobenzone, do not buy it. These are endocrine disruptors, meaning they interfere with your body's hormone balance. Also, if the label says 'fragrance,' avoid it. That one word can hide a cocktail of chemicals like phthalates and parabens, both known to disrupt hormones and linked to long-term health risks."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Which sunscreens are safer and better for your skin&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Chopra recommends opting for mineral-based sunscreens with ingredients like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide. "These sit on top of the skin rather than getting absorbed into your bloodstream. The newer formulations are lightweight, fast-absorbing, and offer a natural matte finish, without the white cast."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He further emphasises the importance of choosing the right face sunscreen, saying, "When it comes to facial sunscreens, it's even more important to choose wisely. Facial skin is thinner, more absorbent, and often exposed daily. That means any toxins in your sunscreen have a quicker path into your bloodstream. Many commercial face sunscreens are marketed as lightweight or non-greasy, but they still contain the same &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/heres-how-harmful-chemicals-in-plastic-up-risk-of-postpartum-depression-101617597854709.html" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="harmful chemicals"&gt;harmful chemicals&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, look for mineral sunscreens labelled 'non-comedogenic', which means they won't clog your pores. They should also be free from fragrance, parabens, and silicones."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Remember this: What you put on your skin can harm your gut just as much as what you put into your mouth. Choose consciously, your hormone health depends on it," Dr Chopra concludes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Note to readers: This article is for informational purposes only and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

Now, most children in rich countries are cured.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/header&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the past, when I’d hear the words childhood leukemia, I’d picture a young child who suddenly became seriously ill, and whose parents were told their child had only a few years to live.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’d wonder how a child might grasp the idea of limited time, or how painful it must have been to face the possibility of missing out on growing up, discovering who they are, and forming deep friendships. It would also be a tragic experience for their family, friends, and classmates, who might struggle to understand what’s happening.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This picture, reflected in films, books, and television, depicts what used to be a grim reality. Childhood leukemia was fatal for the vast majority of children who developed it in the past. Before the 1970s, fewer than 10% of children diagnosed with the disease survived five years after diagnosis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But since then, this outlook has improved dramatically. In North America and Europe, around 85% now survive that long.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-1" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What made this dramatic change possible? In this article, I’ll describe the progress achieved and some concrete reasons behind it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This article focuses on data from North America and Europe; death rates from childhood cancers have also &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cancer-death-rate-in-children-under-5-years-old-by-type" class="span-link"&gt;&lt;span&gt;declined in other world regions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, but remain higher.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 class="h1-semibold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="leukemia-is-the-most-common-childhood-cancer-and-its-mortality-rates-have-been-reduced-substantially"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Leukemia is the most common childhood cancer, and its mortality rates have been reduced substantially&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#leukemia-is-the-most-common-childhood-cancer-and-its-mortality-rates-have-been-reduced-substantially"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many different types of cancer can affect children. This article focuses on leukemia, the most common type of childhood cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the chart below, you can see the reduction in cancer death rates in the United States among children of different ages. The decline has been particularly large for leukemia, with a 14-fold drop, but we’ve also made much progress on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cancer-death-rates-in-children-under-10-years-old" class="span-link"&gt;&lt;span&gt;other, less common childhood cancers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article-block__image article-block__image--wide col-start-4 span-cols-8 col-md-start-2 span-md-cols-12"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="article-block__image-caption col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Explore the data for other countries in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/cancer-death-rates-in-children-under-10-years-old?country=~USA" class="span-link"&gt;&lt;span&gt;an interactive chart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Leukemia is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow — the tissue that produces blood cells. It develops when immature white blood cells grow out of control and crowd out healthy ones, leading to symptoms like fatigue, infections, easy bruising or bleeding, and pale skin.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While leukemia becomes more common with age, it’s the most frequent cancer in children, making up about a quarter of all childhood cancer cases in the United States.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-2" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; One reason may be that blood-forming tissues are especially active during childhood, when the body grows quickly and needs a steady supply of new blood cells to carry oxygen, fight infections, and form clots. Many of these cells also have short lifespans, and this stage of life is a crucial period for immune system development.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-3" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is very demanding for the bone marrow, which must constantly produce new cells. Each time a cell divides, there’s a small chance of a DNA error, and the more divisions that occur, the greater the chance that some of these errors will lead to cancer.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are two main types of leukemia in children. The most common is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which starts in early lymphoid cells. The other is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;acute myeloid leukemia (AML)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which begins in other blood-forming cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-4" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Most childhood leukemia cases result from genetic mutations that develop spontaneously during this rapid cell division, often occurring before birth, while others are due to inherited genetic mutations, which are less common.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-5" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; While several environmental exposures have been investigated, there hasnʼt been consistent evidence for any environmental causes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-6" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 class="h1-semibold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="childhood-leukemia-has-become-much-more-treatable"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Childhood leukemia has become much more treatable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#childhood-leukemia-has-become-much-more-treatable"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Survival rates for children with leukemia have risen dramatically in the last 50 years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The chart below plots overall survival rates — the share of children still alive after a given time since their diagnosis. The data comes from trials by the Children’s Oncology Group, which has enrolled tens of thousands of children since the 1960s, and now includes over half of all children with leukemia in the US.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-7" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The top panel displays this for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) while the bottom panel shows acute myeloid leukemia (AML).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the top panel, you can see that in the 1960s, only around 14% of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia survived at least five years. Despite initially improving upon treatment, most relapsed and died soon after.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;By the 2010s, the chances of survival had increased dramatically: 94% of children survived at least five years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some might wonder whether treatment only delays death rather than being a cure. However, researchers have also analyzed survival rates over the long term and found large improvements: the chart shows that most children are still alive ten years after diagnosis. After the initial years of treatment, their long-term survival is much more stable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="article-block__image article-block__image--wide col-start-4 span-cols-8 col-md-start-2 span-md-cols-12"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The bottom panel of the chart shows the improvement for acute myeloid leukemia. This subtype, which makes up about 25% of childhood leukemia cases, is more challenging to treat than acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Survival rates for this form have also improved, though not quite as dramatically.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the 1970s, just 14% of children with acute myeloid leukemia survived at least five years. Now, over 60% do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This improvement in survival reflects the impact of intensive treatment regimens. These treatments usually still involve years of intensive chemotherapy, which is often physically and mentally challenging and can cause long-term side effects. However, chronic health problems after treatment have become less common, and the long-term health of these children has improved significantly.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-8" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;This dramatic improvement in survival rates is reflected in the large declines in death rates we saw in the previous section.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1 class="h1-semibold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="coordination-drug-development-and-molecular-research-have-driven-progress-in-treating-leukemia"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Coordination, drug development, and molecular research have driven progress in treating leukemia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#coordination-drug-development-and-molecular-research-have-driven-progress-in-treating-leukemia"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;You may notice from the chart above that much of this progress has been continuous. Progress in treating leukemia hasn’t come from a single breakthrough but from a series of advances building on one another.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before the 1940s, children with leukemia usually died within a few weeks of diagnosis, and only comfort care was available. The first chemotherapy agents — aminopterin and, later, 6-mercaptopurine — could briefly eliminate leukemia cells. They gave families hope, but the cancer almost always returned.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-9" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-bold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="chemotherapy-is-better-tailored-to-each-child"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Chemotherapy is better tailored to each child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#chemotherapy-is-better-tailored-to-each-child"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers identified more drugs during the 1950s and early 1960s. Then they took the next logical step: giving several medicines together as a combination and using cranial radiation on spinal fluid — that is, targeting the brain and spine with radiation to kill hidden cancer cells. This helped eliminate leukemia cells that remained in the central nervous system, and doctors began to notice that a small number of patients were being cured.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The 1960s and 1970s saw another breakthrough. Researchers tried “multi-phase” chemotherapy regimens, where treatment was given in four key stages — induction, consolidation, delayed intensification, and maintenance — typically over two to three years. Each phase uses combinations of chemotherapy drugs to eliminate leukemia cells and prevent relapse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-10" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; In clinical trials, these regimens were successful, seeing survival rates of more than 50%, and hospitals in both North America and Europe ran similar studies and adopted the regimen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-11" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the 1980s and early 1990s, researchers found that intensive chemotherapy directed at the spinal fluid could protect the brain just as well as cranial radiation, but with far fewer long-term side effects.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-11" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;By the mid-1990s, it also became clear that a single regimen didn’t fit everyone. Large trials sorted children into risk groups (this is called “risk stratification”) based on their age, white blood cell counts, and early genetic findings. Researchers found that lighter chemotherapy could spare the low-risk group from side effects, while stronger chemotherapy could save many in the high-risk group.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-12" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Laboratory science then gave doctors even sharper diagnostic tools. For example, tests of “measurable residual disease”, which became widely used in the early 2000s, can spot a single leukemia cell among 10,000 normal cells and help guide further treatment — such as whether to dial treatment back or trigger extra therapy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-13" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;All of this showed that large improvements came not just from inventing new drugs, but from optimizing how existing drugs were used. This included finding the right combinations and dosages for different risk groups, adjusting treatment timing and duration to minimize toxic side effects, and identifying subgroups that could safely receive less intensive chemotherapy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;But how did researchers learn which treatment strategies work best?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;A key reason was widespread collaboration in clinical trials and research networks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-bold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="large-collaborations-made-better-research-possible"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Large collaborations made better research possible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#large-collaborations-made-better-research-possible"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Childhood leukemia is rare, so it’s very unlikely that a single hospital will see enough cases to draw strong conclusions on its own. To overcome this, researchers formed large collaborative groups and enrolled thousands of children in research studies and clinical trials. These trials helped test which regimens were safer and more effective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since then, research groups merged into even larger collaborations to run bigger clinical trials, like the Children’s Oncology Group in North America and the International BFM Study Group in Europe.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-14" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Over 50% of children with leukemia in the US are enrolled in clinical trials.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-7" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; This coordination has been crucial in increasing survival rates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It has helped increase “statistical power” — the ability to detect differences between treatments. It also helped address another challenge: before these clinical trials, treatment was highly variable, with different doctors and hospitals using protocols that were often suboptimal, and survival rates varied widely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The result was better treatment standards, refined chemotherapy regimens, and reduced harmful practices. One example I mentioned earlier was cranial irradiation, which was once commonly used to prevent leukemia from spreading to the brain. Although it was effective, it carried serious long-term risks, including cognitive impairment and growth problems. Based on the results of these trials, it has now been largely replaced by less toxic chemotherapy-based strategies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-15" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-bold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="breakthroughs-in-genetic-and-molecular-research-led-to-further-progress"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Breakthroughs in genetic and molecular research led to further progress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#breakthroughs-in-genetic-and-molecular-research-led-to-further-progress"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Advances in genetic and molecular research have also transformed the treatment of childhood leukemia. By uncovering which genetic mutations drove different subtypes of the disease, researchers could better identify which children were likely to benefit from standard therapy, and which needed more intensive chemotherapy or other types of treatment, as part of the “risk stratification” approach mentioned earlier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The research also led to targeted drugs to block some children's specific cancer mutations. One prominent example was imatinib (“Gleevec”), a drug initially developed for chronic myeloid leukemia in adults. It blocks a mutant protein that triggers leukemia cells to multiply rapidly. Although only a small percentage of children with leukemia have this mutation, their survival used to be very poor, and they often needed bone marrow transplants. When imatinib was added to chemotherapy regimens in the 2000s, their survival improved dramatically, and many no longer needed a transplant.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-15" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;More recently, new immunotherapies have reshaped treatment, including CAR-T cell therapy and antibody therapies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-16" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-bold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="better-supportive-care-helped-children"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Better supportive care helped children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#better-supportive-care-helped-children"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;While chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy get much of the attention, better supportive care has also been critical in treating childhood leukemia. This is important because chemotherapy can harm vital organs and suppress the immune system, so children need protection from infections, bleeding, and complications.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over the last few decades, new treatments and vaccines have helped protect children against these other complications, including:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="article-block__list col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Routine platelet transfusions. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Before the 1970s, low platelet counts caused fatal bleeds in the brain or gut during intensive chemotherapy. Once blood banks learned to collect and store platelet concentrates at room temperature, daily blood transfusions became practical and deaths fell.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-17" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; to prevent and treat infections, which are a major cause of early deaths during chemotherapy. Recently, more treatments have been approved and added to standard care for leukemia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-18" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Expanded use of vaccines &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;to protect children with weakened immune systems. Over the past few decades, new vaccines — for example, against pneumococcal disease, chickenpox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;(varicella), and rotavirus — have helped prevent common but potentially serious infections in children with cancer. Some vaccines are recommended for patients themselves, while others are for family members and caregivers to reduce the risk of passing infections.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stem cell transplantation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; is still reserved for the hardest cases, but how it’s done has changed. Years ago, doctors performed transplants with full-body radiation and often reinfused the child’s cells — both practices raised long-term risks and could risk cancer cells sneaking back in. Today, they usually give high-dose chemotherapy instead of radiation, and use stem cells from another donor, which can also help hunt down remaining leukemia cells.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="#note-19" class="ref"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr class="article-block__horizontal-rule col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;For families today, a diagnosis of childhood leukemia is no longer the terrifying death sentence it once was. Most children now survive, complete treatment, return to school, and grow up being able to look forward to longer, healthier lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The experience is still incredibly difficult. Hospital visits, harsh side effects, and long periods of uncertainty take a serious emotional toll. Not every child is cured, and there are long-term risks from treatment, though these have been reduced as well.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The impact of this progress is undeniable. Children now live longer and healthier, and their families can hope for and plan for the future in ways that weren’t possible just a few decades ago.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The story of childhood leukemia shows how science, collaboration, and persistence can turn a deadly disease into a largely treatable one. In just decades, it has gone from one of the most feared childhood illnesses to one of the most treatable cancers, and it’s a model for what medical research can achieve.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-block__text col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The next big challenge is ensuring that these advances reach children everywhere. This article has focused on progress in high-income countries, but access to timely diagnosis and treatment is still limited in many parts of the world. Expanding access globally is essential so that every child, no matter where they live, has the chance to live a long life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="h2-bold article-block__heading col-start-5 span-cols-6 col-md-start-3 span-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2" id="continue-reading-on-our-world-in-data"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Continue reading on Our World in Data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="deep-link" href="#continue-reading-on-our-world-in-data"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;a class="article-block__prominent-link grid grid-cols-6 span-cols-6 col-start-5 span-md-cols-10 col-md-start-3 grid-md-cols-10 span-sm-cols-12 col-sm-start-2 grid-sm-cols-12 prominent-link" href="https://ourworldindata.org/hpv-vaccination-world-can-eliminate-cervical-cancer"&gt;&lt;div class="col-sm-start-4 col-md-start-3 col-start-2 col-end-limit"&gt;&lt;p class="prominent-link__heading-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h3 class="h3-bold"&gt;HPV vaccination: How the world can eliminate cervical cancer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-3-medium"&gt;HPV vaccines offer a rare opportunity to effectively eliminate one type of cancer.

He decided to donate her brain to science hoping to contribute to a cure for Alzheimer's disease. The family contacted Biological Resource Center, a local company that brokered the donation of human bodies for research. Within the hour, BRC dispatched a driver to collect Doris.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jim signed a form authorizing medical research on his mother's body. Ten days later, Jim received his mother's cremated remains - but it turns out her ashes were made up of a singular arm sawn off from her body. The rest of her corpse had met a violent fate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Doris' brain never was used for Alzheimer's research. Instead, her body became part of an Army experiment to measure damage caused by roadside bombs, reports &lt;a href="https://www.irishstar.com/news/us-news/i-donated-moms-body-alzheimers-35335687" target="_self" rel="Follow" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link"&gt;the Irish Star&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="35349829" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Internal BRC and military records show that at least 20 other bodies were also used in the blast experiments without permission of the donors or their relatives, a violation of U.S. Army policy. Jim had also ticked a box specifically banning any kind of experiments on Doris. BRC sold donated bodies like Stauffer's for $5,893 each.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jim said: "She was strapped in a chair, and a detonation took place underneath her to get an idea of what the human body goes through when a vehicle is hit by an IED. There was wording on this paperwork about performing tests that may involve explosions, and we said, 'No'."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Army officials involved in the project said they never received the consent forms that donors or their families had signed. Rather, the officials said they relied on assurances from BRC that families had agreed to let the bodies be used in such experiments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="35349830" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;BRC, which sold more than 20,000 parts from some 5,000 human bodies over a decade, is no longer in business. Its former owner, Stephen Gore, pleaded guilty to fraud in 2022. In a statement to Reuters, Gore said that he always tried to honour the wishes of donors and sent consent forms when researchers requested them. Jim said of Gore "He didn't care about the families, he didn't care about the people."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jim learned of the fate of his mother's body from a Reuters reporter and "curled his lip in anger and clutched his wife Lisa's arm. "We did right," Lisa reassured him. "They just did not honor our wishes."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No federal law regulates body brokers like BRC, and no U.S. government agency monitors what happens to cadavers pledged for use in medical education and research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="35349827" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;"It is not illegal to sell a whole body or the parts of a body for research or education," said University of Iowa law professor Sheldon F. Kurtz, who helped modify the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, which has been adopted by 46 states. Although the act was updated in 2006, Kurtz said, "the issue of whole bodies or body parts for research or education never came up during our discussions."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since then, the body trade has become big business. Only one state, New York, keeps detailed records on the industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the most recent data available, companies that did business in New York shipped at least 100,000 body parts across the country from 2011 to 2014. Reuters obtained the data, which have never been made public, from the state's health department.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"I feel foolish," said Jim. "I'm not a trusting person, but, you have no idea this is going on." Military officials said they took BRC's word that permission had been given.

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Nothing stuck until Pagan, a 36-year-old personal caregiver from Revere, learned late last year of &lt;a href="https://healthcity.bmc.org/substance-use-disorder-program-offers-new-approach-stimulant-addiction-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://healthcity.bmc.org/substance-use-disorder-program-offers-new-approach-stimulant-addiction-treatment/"&gt;an innovative new &lt;/a&gt;initiative at the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program that gave her a financial incentive to stay sober. Every time she took a drug test that was free of cocaine, showed up for a recovery group meeting, or&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;engaged in physical exercise, Pagan was rewarded with $5 loaded onto a debit card.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;While modest, the payments were enough to motivate Pagan to keep coming back, week after week, to a program that taught her new strategies for controlling her cravings. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“When you’re living on the edge, sometimes you need something — even if it’s small — to feel better about yourself and your future," she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Pagan is among hundreds of people addicted to stimulants in New England who are part of a bold but debated experiment: giving financial rewards to people who abstain from illicit drugs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In cities across the region, treatment providers are embracing the concept of monetary awards as they seek new ways to combat a troubling surge in the use of psychostimulants such as methamphetamine and cocaine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The approach is known as &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8034391/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8034391/"&gt;“contingency management&lt;/a&gt;" and it’s based on a simple premise: that giving people tangible rewards for staying abstinent can rewire the brain, so people associate not using stimulants with positive outcomes. &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/208958" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/208958"&gt;An abundance of scientific studies&lt;/a&gt; and clinical trials have found the approach highly effective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Policy makers are banking on the intervention to help address a gaping hole in the substance use treatment system. There are no targeted medications for the estimated &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/reports/rpt47095/National%20Report/National%20Report/2023-nsduh-annual-national.pdf" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/reports/rpt47095/National%20Report/National%20Report/2023-nsduh-annual-national.pdf"&gt;3.8 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; who are addicted to stimulants, as there are for opioids and alcohol, so stimulant addictions are among the hardest to treat. Compared with opioids, such as fentanyl and heroin, stimulants are a slow killer. Sustained use can lead to heart failure, strokes, and &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/learn/stimulants#:~:text=Long%2Dterm%20Health%20Risks,-Chronic%20meth%20use&amp;amp;text=High%20blood%20pressure%20leading%20to,or%20years%20after%20meth%20use)" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.samhsa.gov/substance-use/learn/stimulants#:~:text=Long%2Dterm%20Health%20Risks,-Chronic%20meth%20use&amp;amp;text=High%20blood%20pressure%20leading%20to,or%20years%20after%20meth%20use)"&gt;higher rates of paranoia, anxiety, and hallucinations&lt;/a&gt;, studies have found.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“People have been brainwashed into thinking that depriving people and letting them `hit bottom’ is the only way for somebody to get better, and contingency management flies in the face of that,” said Deirdre Calvert, director of the state Department of Public Health’s Bureau of Substance Addiction Services. “Most importantly, it works.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;While offering people small rewards for abstinence dates to the 1980s, the approach has been slow to catch on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;One of the biggest obstacles has been the moral objection to the idea of paying people to stay off drugs — which, critics argue, they should be doing anyway. Legal concerns have been another barrier. Treatment providers have long worried they could run afoul of &lt;a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/forefront/contingency-management-highly-effective-treatment-substance-use-disorders-and-legal" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/forefront/contingency-management-highly-effective-treatment-substance-use-disorders-and-legal"&gt;the federal anti-kickback law&lt;/a&gt; if they are seen to be enticing people with gifts. For these reasons, private and public insurance programs generally have been unwilling to cover the treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Yet attitudes began to change a few years ago amid a troubling new reality. Many people were taking cocaine and meth without realizing it was &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/about/fentanyl.html#:~:text=Fentanyl%20is%20a%20powerful%20synthetic,illegally%20made%20fentanyl%20(IMF)." target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/about/fentanyl.html#:~:text=Fentanyl%20is%20a%20powerful%20synthetic,illegally%20made%20fentanyl%20(IMF)."&gt;laced with fentanyl&lt;/a&gt;, a synthetic opioid that is lethal even in tiny amounts. In Massachusetts, cocaine began appearing in more than 50 percent of opioid-related deaths, according to state health data. The trend has been particularly &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/01/30/metro/boston-black-men-dying-drug-overdoses-alarming-rates/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/01/30/metro/boston-black-men-dying-drug-overdoses-alarming-rates/"&gt;devastating in communities of color&lt;/a&gt;, where cocaine is still the drug of choice among many Black men.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;At the same time, states received the &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/learn-about-the-ags-statewide-opioid-settlements-with-opioid-industry-defendants" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/learn-about-the-ags-statewide-opioid-settlements-with-opioid-industry-defendants"&gt;first wave of billions of dollars in payments&lt;/a&gt; from the pharmaceutical industry for their role in the deadly opioid epidemic. Flush with cash, state health officials began looking for new ways to provide treatment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;So in 2021, Boston Medical Center received a $1.43 million grant from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to launch &lt;a href="" target="_blank" rel="" title=""&gt;the state’s first contingency management program&lt;/a&gt;, known as START. People who participated would come in once a week to complete a urine test and, if it’s negative for stimulants, receive $5 on a debit card. Attend a group meeting, visit a nurse, or do a workout at a gym, and participants could make another $5. Those who stick with the program a year can make up to $75, and participate in drawings for prizes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Interest in the program has far exceeded expectations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Justin Alves, co-medical director for the START program and a nurse educator with the &lt;a href="https://www.addictiontraining.org/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.addictiontraining.org/"&gt;Grayken Center for Addiction Training and Technical Assistance&lt;/a&gt;, said they expected 60 people to enroll in the first two years. Within six months, they had nearly doubled that number. People were driving from more than two hours away to attend the support meetings in Boston. To accommodate the demand, Boston Medical Center expanded the program to clinical sites in Lawrence, New Bedford, and Springfield, and at the &lt;a href="https://www.bhchp.org/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bhchp.org/"&gt;Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program’s&lt;/a&gt; main office in Boston.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;All told, 660 patients with stimulant use disorders have participated in the program since 2021; and more than 50 percent have been people of color, according to Boston Medical Center.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Organizers of the program are now looking to tap opioid settlement funds to expand the incentives to $300 to $500 per person per year, consistent with scientific studies showing that larger amounts are more effective in promoting abstinence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The $75 was enough to get people to come to group [meetings],” Alves said. “By the time the $75 ran out, we had nurse-patient relationships with people and that’s what has made the program blossom.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Behavioral scientists said the programs are effective in part because the prizes act much like stimulants do — by increasing dopamine levels in the brain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The US Department of Veterans Affairs was &lt;a href="https://news.va.gov/64870/how-va-uses-contingency-management-help-veterans-stay-drug-free/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://news.va.gov/64870/how-va-uses-contingency-management-help-veterans-stay-drug-free/"&gt;among the pioneers&lt;/a&gt; of the concept. Since 2011, the agency has provided financial awards for negative urine tests to more than 8,000 veterans struggling with substance use disorders. Out of 105,000 urine samples provided by these veterans during their treatment, 92 percent tested negative for the target drugs, primarily stimulants, according to a spokesperson for the VA.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The concept is also taking hold in Maine, which has been &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/16/health/meth-maine-fentanyl.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;particularly hard hit&lt;/a&gt; by meth-related overdoses. Since last June, &lt;a href="https://www.mainehealth.org/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.mainehealth.org/"&gt;MaineHealth&lt;/a&gt;, the state’s largest health care network, has launched or expanded &lt;a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#search/caroline/FMfcgzQbfVGtklzSRVGkVKjWVcFJLcpm?projector=1" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#search/caroline/FMfcgzQbfVGtklzSRVGkVKjWVcFJLcpm?projector=1"&gt;contingency management programs&lt;/a&gt; at several locations. So far, more than 120 patients have participated and between 64 and 66 percent of urine drug screens have been negative for stimulants, with missed appointments counting as a positive test, according to MaineHealth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;And in Vermont, &lt;a href="https://howardcenter.org/about-us/about/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://howardcenter.org/about-us/about/"&gt;the Howard Center&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit community health agency in Burlington, last October began enrolling people facing charges related to their substance use that offers $20 for every negative drug test up to a maximum of $800. Since then, every person who engaged in the program has delivered twice-weekly urine tests that are drug-free — a 100 percent success rate. Several of the participants have been sober long enough to regain custody of their children, the organization said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Some treatment providers are wary of giving prizes that they say patients could then sell or trade for drugs. Yet that hasn’t emerged as a problem, say clinicians and researchers. The Howard Center tracks how participants spend the rewards and found they largely use the money to buy food, gas, and other basic items.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Rosario Malcolm-Testaverde credits a contingency management program with potentially saving his life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;He spent 15 years addicted to crystal methamphetamine, bouncing in and out of hospital emergency departments, before he discovered the Boston Health Care for the Homeless program. He didn’t need the money, yet the weekly prizes gave him an incentive to show up at group meetings. There, he encountered a community of people who understood the powerful pull of crystal meth and its dangerous side effects — including paranoia and auditory hallucinations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“I felt fully recognized as a human being,” said Malcolm-Testaverde, 36. “And the rewards system helped replace the dopamine hit I would get [from crystal meth].”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;At noon on a recent Monday, the mood was upbeat as Pagan and a dozen other people in recovery filed into a brightly lit conference room at the Boston Health Care for the Homeless office at 780 Albany St.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;One by one, members introduced themselves and talked about what they were looking forward to in their lives. An older man named John described the daily challenge of staying sober when, each day, he encountered people using cocaine outside his apartment building in Cambridge’s Central Square.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Among the last to speak, Pagan proudly announced to the group that she had just received word of a new job opportunity and was brushing up her resume — something she never would have imagined just a couple of years ago, when she was still living on the streets and using drugs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Hopefully a door opens because I feel like I’m ready,” Pagan said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In an instant, everyone around the table burst into applause.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

            When Ayva Peña got a phone at age 10, her interest in skin care skyrocketed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh700023j6n3rujwgyo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At first, she bonded over it with her mother, Giselle Peña. Together, they would have spa days with face masks and take occasional shopping trips to try out new products. But when the Rhode Island mother found a $300 anti-aging face cream in Ayva’s medicine drawer, it gave her pause.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh700033j6n9rchvn4s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I got very upset. … She’s 15 years old,” Peña said. “It says it makes your skin ageless, improves fine lines, wrinkles and firmness. I was like, ‘This is not for you, girl.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh700043j6nbjsc85wj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Peña is among a growing number of parents &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/12/style/tweens-skin-care-wellness"&gt;concerned&lt;/a&gt; about how content on social media platforms is influencing children and teens into trying out elaborate, often age-inappropriate skin care products. Now, a &lt;a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/06/tiktok-teen-skin-care-routines-are-harmful/?fj=1#tab-panel1" target="_blank"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published Monday in the journal Pediatrics may confirm those parents’ worries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh700053j6nykq6b0w9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            After analyzing beauty routines from 100 TikTok videos by content creators ages 7 through 18, researchers found an average of 11 potentially irritating active ingredients among their regimens, many of which carry a risk of developing skin allergies and increased sun sensitivity. Only a quarter of the lengthy product lists contained sunscreens, however.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh700063j6nou29ljul@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The majority of (children) featured in these videos didn’t have any visible acne. They had perfect, clear skin,” said Dr. Molly Hales, the first study author and a board-certified dermatologist in the department of dermatology at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine. “For many of them, the harms probably outweigh any potential benefits.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh700073j6nyh9hfu7e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Between the dozens of daily serums, moisturizers, toners and cleansers featured in the videos, the average routine was six steps long, costing about $168 — with some more than $500 — for one month’s worth of product, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh700083j6ngr5gntc3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you have kids waking up at 5:30 in the morning on a school day to have enough time to layer on these complicated regimens, I think it becomes less about health and more (about) pursuing an idea of beauty that is unrealistic and problematic,” said Hales, who is also a postdoctoral research fellow at Feinberg. The findings raise serious ethical questions about how social media content influences young people in their everyday lives, she added
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh700093j6nkn69iu8p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A TikTok spokesperson, noting that this type of content is “common across all media,” said the platform is only for users ages 13 and older, and any creators suspected to be under 13 are removed. Additionally, they said that TikTok works with third-party doctors and experts in adolescent development to implement safeguarding policies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000a3j6nue36falx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Most of the studied skin care routines lacked a form of sunscreen but contained products that could increase sun sensitivity and risk of skin cancer, the authors found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000b3j6nb4fc59vp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Common active ingredients found in recommended skin products were alpha hydroxy acids or AHAs, mild chemical exfoliants that help remove top layers of skin cells, Hales said. While they have the intended effect of evening skin tone and creating a more youthful appearance, they are known to make the skin more vulnerable to the sun’s ultraviolet rays.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000c3j6nsbtow180@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I would recommend daily sunscreen use for all ages and regimens, but especially for those using these (AHAs),” Hales said. “It’s a necessary step to prevent permanent skin damage.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000d3j6n426hne1d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those AHAs, as well as vitamin-based ingredients such as niacinamide, are also considered potential irritants, carrying side effects such as redness and dryness, especially with overuse.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000e3j6n4vwfv49j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In many cases, the girls may not have realized they were applying the same active ingredient again and again, which just increases the risk of irritation,” said Dr. Tara Lagu, senior study author and adjunct lecturer of medicine and medical social sciences at Feinberg.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000f3j6n3897q6yd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than half the products contained fragrance — a common cause of allergic contact dermatitis — and 20 other inactive ingredients that are known allergens, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000g3j6nucebr1xy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Misinformation is a big issue on social media, but especially for these content creators younger than 18,” said Dr. Sonal Shah, a board-certified dermatologist in Cleveland and director of pediatric dermatology at University Hospitals Rainbow Babies &amp;amp; Children’s Hospital. Shah was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000h3j6nkop7rdt7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These are sources that perhaps don’t have a scientific background and are not well read in the science behind a lot of these products, how they work, or what risks they carry,” Shah said, adding that there are board-certified dermatologists on TikTok that could offer more credible advice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000i3j6nxoujsmys@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Other concerning trends Shah has seen in her practice, but were not mentioned in the study, include mechanical exfoliants, such as scrubbing wands or cleansers containing plastic microbeads, which are often too rough for facial skin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000j3j6n1kj15vhk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study also noted that many of the creators were offering tips relevant to those with lighter complexions, which may exclude the unique skin care considerations of darker complexions while perpetuating harmful ideals of “brighter” skin associated with whiteness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000k3j6nlh2encw5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Both Shah and Hales recommend children under 18 who are not dealing with acne use a gentle cleanser with no active ingredients, paired with a fragrance-free moisturizer and a daily mineral sunscreen.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000l3j6ngbqx6v7r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In general, children will not benefit from anti-aging products that promise to boost skin elasticity or eliminate fine lines, Shah said. In these young ages, collagen production is at the highest it will ever be.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000m3j6nvwnu447l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As children reach puberty, however, they may produce more acne-causing hormones. In those cases, Shah recommends adding an over-the-counter product with salicylic acid or a low percentage of benzoyl peroxide.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000n3j6n199byr74@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Their skin care does not have to be complicated and does not have to be very expensive,” Shah said. Parents “can talk to a board-certified dermatologist or pediatric dermatologist if there are skin concerns that are significant or don’t respond to over-the-counter treatment.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000o3j6n4mscjgvj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Ultimately, if parents are concerned about their child’s skin care regimen, they should talk about it, said Jennifer Harriger, a professor of psychology at Pepperdine University who studies childhood development, in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000p3j6nlhc57676@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I think that it is always best to have open conversations with children about the messages they see on social media as well as their own intentions behind purchasing particular skincare products,” said Harriger, who was not involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000q3j6nygov5upo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s also important to keep an open mind, understanding the social dimension of youth beauty and wellness content, Hales said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmblkxdh7000r3j6nrb2ee095@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These videos show a kind of playful self-expression that’s very appealing to this age group,” Hales said. “These are girls who are just starting to develop their own sense of independent identity, how they present (themselves) in the world, their gender identity, and in many cases what it means to be a girl in our society.”

It certainly wouldn’t be something that the young mother, who was eight months pregnant with twins at the time, would have recalled 25 years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But today, in an exclusive interview with the Daily Mail, Kalafus remembers that childish fumble as the moment she knew, on a cellular level, that her fears that something was terribly wrong with her were well-founded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained: ‘It was like being stabbed. I nearly hit the ceiling because I was in such pain.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A few days later she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-7bae9640-42f7-11f0-b8b3-4d00d0342359"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;. The fact that the diagnosis was a vindication of sorts, brought no satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kalafus had been raising concerns over what she felt certain were abnormal symptoms throughout her pregnancy only to have them repeatedly overlooked by her doctor who, she claims, dismissed them as the baseless fears of a ‘hysterical woman.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now 56, Kalafus is chronicling her story in her new memoir, ‘Flood,’ published by Woodhall Press. She believes patients who can sense something wrong in their own bodies often know better than medical professionals in whom they place their trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Christine Kalafus, now 56, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer two days before she was forced to deliver her twins early&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kalafus shows off her large baby bump in December 2000 — a few weeks before she her life-threatening diagnosis of triple-negative intra-ductal carcinoma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kalafus became pregnant in the Spring of 2000, a year after her husband, Greg, confessed he'd had an affair with another woman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She explained that they were determined to save their marriage and put the infidelity behind them so when she conceived twins she hoped it would be a fresh start. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, when Kalafus was five-and-a-half months pregnant, she began experiencing an unpleasant sensation like someone was sticking pins or fine needles into her right breast.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She touched the breast and felt a hard, walnut-size lump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The discovery rang alarm bells in her head. ‘I immediately thought of my paternal grandmother who died of breast cancer at 35 when I was ten,’ she said. ‘Then I reassured myself that I was only 31 so it’s unlikely to be that.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She decided to mention it during a routine check-up three days later with her OBGYN — for whom she uses the pseudonym Dr Robb in her book — who had delivered her first child in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She saw Dr Robb every three weeks because she was carrying twins and there was an elevated risk to the pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But according to Kalafus, her doctor seemed more interested in measuring the size of her stomach than listening to the concerns she was raising about her breast. He looked at the lump, she said, and touched it lightly before concluding, ‘It’s nothing. It's just a clogged milk duct.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Looking back Kalafus, a writer based in Connecticut, recognizes the blind faith she placed in the medic simply because he was the authority figure in the room. She doubted herself, not him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I saw his framed diplomas on the wall and didn’t question him,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She didn’t remember lactating until she had given birth to her first child but she reasoned that perhaps she was ‘starting early’ because this time she was having twins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The doctor sent her away without giving any advice on how to deal with the clogged duct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, three weeks later, and still troubled by the persistent symptom, she asked about the lump once more. Again, the doctor dismissed her concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Kalafus she raised the matter at her three subsequent consultations, to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said she started to produce colostrum (the earliest nutrient-dense version of breast milk) which, she thought, backed up his diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In mid-November, Dr. Robb agreed to measure the lump. He noted that it was bigger, but still insisted it was a clogged milk duct that they should ‘just keep an eye on.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘He was like a stuck record,’ she said, adding that she felt belittled and patronized. Kalafus said, ‘I felt like a little child.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kalafus' identical twins Parker and Spencer at 18 months old. They were born by C-section on January 4, 2001 — the same day that their mom underwent a lumpectomy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kalafus and her twins when they were ten months. She was still recovering from her intensive seven-month chemotherapy and radiation treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Yet, it bothered her that this pregnancy felt so different from her first, and she wasn’t convinced that the difference could be put down to the fact that she was expecting twins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She didn’t share her worries with her husband, Greg, who was also 56. She said, ‘I’m not someone who likes to make people worry unnecessarily and so I muscled through myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Besides, we were both busy at work, running a household with a young child and managing the bills.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the agony that she experienced when her young son accidentally elbowed her that day was something she just couldn’t brush off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She booked the first available appointment with Dr. Robb, and by January 2, 2001 she was sitting in his consulting room once more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Unbelievably, her words still fell on deaf ears. While Kalafus told the obstetrician what had happened, he shuffled paperwork and appeared to listen only half-heartedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Little wonder that Kalafus felt desperate and unheard. Thankfully, there was a nurse in the room who seemed far more engaged in Kalafus’s story than the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kalafus was leaving when the nurse called her back. There was a general surgeon’s office over the road, she explained, and they had managed to squeeze her in for an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was seen right away, and the surgeon performed a needle biopsy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Robb called that night after dinner. He had received the results. ‘He didn’t even say “Hello,”’ Kalafus says. ‘He said the tests were positive for cancer.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Christine, then 33, with her three sons, twins Parker and Spencer, 17 months and their older brother, Trevor, six, in 2002&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Barely pausing for breath, the doctor told her that the babies would have to ‘come out,’ adding, ‘We don’t know where else it might be.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Both Kalafus and her husband, Greg, were left to absorb the shocking news overnight before driving to the hospital the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There, the nervous mother-to-be underwent a battery of routine tests such as pre-surgery blood work – and learned that the lump that had started all those weeks ago the size of a nut, had grown to the size of a golf ball.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the absence of an oncologist because everything had happened so quickly, it was left to Dr. Robb to deliver the news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said she needed an immediate C-section ahead of a lumpectomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Spencer and Parker were born on January 4 – at 37 weeks they were considered full term for twins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But there was no time for Kalafus to bathe in any post-birth relief or bond with newborn babies. They were taken away to the baby unit before she could even hold them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile their mother, who had undergone the caesarian under an epidural was now administered a general anesthetic for the lumpectomy which followed immediately on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;When she came round after the two-hour surgery Kalafus had a ‘giant crater’ in her chest where the lump had once been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The tumor was taken for a biopsy in case the cancer had spread. Mercifully, it hadn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She was reunited with her twins and their older brother in her hospital room when, woozy from the anesthetic, she became confused when the babies were wheeled inside in their lucite bassinets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But, when mom put them in my arms, I could smell that new baby smell and realized they were mine.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kalafus met her newborns just a few hours after having breast cancer surgery. At first she was too woozy to realize they belonged to her&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kalafus today. She has undergone annual mammograms since contracting breast cancer at the age of just 31. Thankfully, it had not metastasized&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kalafus was discharged with the newborns — who were a healthy weight — four days later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Then, around a week after that, out of an abundance of caution, doctors took a number of lymph nodes from under her armpit as a pre-emptive measure to ensure the disease had not metastasized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kalafus later found out that she had triple-negative intra-ductal carcinoma – a particularly aggressive cancer that is not responsive to hormone therapies, often diagnosed at a young age and prone to reoccurring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile Spencer and Parker were watched by her mother and aunts. They came to the family's historic house — nicknamed 'The Witch House' as a reference to its sharply pointed center gable resembling a witch's hat — while she underwent more testing and then chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘They did a miraculous job, but I felt robbed of bonding time with my twins,’ Kalafus said, adding, ‘it was supposed to be one of the happiest times of our lives, but Greg and I were terrified about the future.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recalled her oncologist said he wanted to get her to point that she got to see her children graduate high school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As difficult as that was to hear, Kalafus said: ‘I actually thought it was one of the most insensitive things I'd ever heard. I wasn’t just a mother, but an individual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘Not only that, but I was also only 31 years old.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A six-month course of chemotherapy began in early February and her hair started to fall out after the first treatment. Next, she had 30 sessions of radiation on consecutive days of the week, with Sunday off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;With the toxic drugs flooding her system there was no question of her breast-feeding the twins as she’d done Trevor. In fact, her illness, and its treatment, impacted every part of those first few precious months with her newborns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Kalafus. Recalling her cancer treatment after her twins were born, she said, ‘it was supposed to be one of the happiest times of our lives, but Greg and I were terrified about the future’ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: The so-called 'Witch House' in Connecticut where Kalafus lived with her family at the time she was pregnant with the twins and later had cancer treatment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘I was often too weak from the treatment to pick them up,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She and Greg sat Trevor down to tell him what was happening. ‘We said, “Mommy needs medication to make feel her better,” and he accepted that.’ The little boy even helped her shave her head to neaten things up after most of her hair had gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now aged 24 and 29, her sons are wholly relieved their mother, who still has mammograms every year, has not suffered a recurrence of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Kalafus, Dr Robb — whom she didn’t challenge directly — never once expressed any remorse for his inaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said she didn’t think of taking legal action against him, partly because of the cost. ‘Nor am I a great believer in blaming people who make mistakes,' she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead, today Kalafus advocates for women — especially expectant mothers — to stand up for themselves in the face of medical arrogance or indifference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She said: ‘It's one thing for the grocery clerk not to believe you when you say the zucchini is bad, but it's another thing for a doctor to dismiss you. One is just an annoyance. The other is a possible death sentence.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                                            Estimated read time: 6-7
                                            minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weight loss: it's as simple as eating less and exercising more, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. It really isn't. If losing weight takes forever but you gain weight seemingly overnight, you might actually have health problems that are thwarting your efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angie Ehrenzweig is a good example of how necessary it is to overcome health problems first. Yes, she lost 100 pounds in one year — but the weight came off very slowly at first. When she showed up at &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=100lbs-June25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;, she was struggling with fibromyalgia, extreme fatigue, insulin resistance, depression, systemic inflammation and metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After work, she had so little energy left that she would go home and sit in her recliner the rest of the evening. She could no longer go on hikes with her friends or spend quality time with her husband and children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Her first appointment and scan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At her first appointment, Dr. Whit Roberts, D.C. of &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=100lbs-June25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; ran a specialized scan on her body. The scan is a non-invasive functional state assessment of the body which provides an immediate overview of the patient's physiology, stress, fatigue, risk factors, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts was immediately able to see many physiological challenges Angie was dealing with.  Reporting her impressions of the scan Angie said, "I was blown away. I couldn't believe how much information I got and how much I learned about my health. I doubt I would have learned more with 20 blood tests and an MRI."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to every appointment at Health Utah, patients fill out a proprietary questionnaire that can identify additional health problems that contribute to stubborn weight. The questionnaire is the result of Roberts' 28 years of experience and research. There is almost always a perfect correlation between the results of the scan and the questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts uses both of these to guide him through a 40-minute consultation and evaluation. Why so long? Roberts says, "The art of reviewing someone's health history is almost completely lost to medicine these days. If a test or image can't show a problem, doctors often ignore the patient's symptoms. This is really too bad. A wealth of information can be derived from listening to the patient. It simply takes a while to hear and see everything the patient has to share."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armed with all the information he needed, Roberts prescribed a protocol of health care and weight loss for Angie. Fortunately, most of the time, his protocols can address everything he identifies in the scan, the questionnaire and the consultation. This was the case with Angie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Health Utah&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time she had finished her care, she no longer suffered with the debilitating pain from fibromyalgia or struggled with crippling exhaustion. Her depression was gone. The inflammation all over her body and swelling in her legs were gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These were signs that the more serious health concerns of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome were resolved. Without resolving health issues first, such as insulin resistance, weight loss is very difficult. This is why Angie lost relatively little weight in the beginning of her program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the program?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;How Roberts and his team at Health Utah addressed all of Angie's conditions is beyond the scope of this article. However, Roberts explained some of the protocols that can be employed for one of her conditions, that of insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With insulin resistance, receptors on the outside of every cell literally change shape and no longer allow insulin to attach. This is a problem since glucose, which fuels the cell, can only enter the cell if insulin attaches," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With insulin resistance, the sugar that is supposed to enter the cells, instead stays in the bloodstream where it causes damage. In an effort to prevent this damage, the body takes the excess sugar and stores it as fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is why you gain weight and have a hard time losing weight with insulin resistance. It's also why you have to resolve it before you spend thousands of dollars and hours of effort to lose weight," Roberts continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many different causes of insulin resistance such as smoking and other lifestyle choices, poor diet, stress, toxins and metabolic disorders. As such there are many ways to address it. To address toxins, for example, Roberts and his team use herbs that upregulate phase one and phase two detoxification of the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplements are also often used to keep blood sugars and insulin levels from spiking in response to food and/or stress. For certain metabolic disorders, increasing the production of the enzyme AMP can help. AMP kinase, for example, can help to resensitize insulin receptors to insulin. "We do this through the use of infrared red light and heat therapy. Since the inflammatory responses of the body can increase the production and release of stress chemicals, the use of inflammation-lowering herbs can mitigate stress," Roberts says. This is also done by identifying and removing foods that are inflammatory from the diet. Roberts also recommends occasional fasting. If you can go longer periods of time with low levels of sugar and insulin in your blood, your receptors tend to become more receptive to insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;First steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts and his staff set aside over an hour for testing, evaluation and consultation. To discourage reserving a time and then not showing up, a small fee of $59 is collected prior to the appointment. Your first step then is to either call (801) 609-3478 or visit &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=100lbs-June25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; today to schedule your testing, evaluation and consultation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Special offer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any health or weight loss journey, it is essential to have the help of family and friends. In a British study, researchers found that both men and women had almost twice as much success losing weight when they did it with a partner. So Health Utah is offering this, their most popular weight loss package, for $59 for two people.  You and a friend can get tested, receive a 17-page report, take the proprietary survey and get a consultation with Dr. Roberts. The scan alone is normally $300 for one person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Call  (801) 609-3478 or visit &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=100lbs-June25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; today to schedule your appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The opinions and conclusions expressed in this article are the sponsor's own and do not reflect the views or opinions of KSL.com.

Yet, an estimated 15-20% of the population in developed countries has a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2701269/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;magnesium deficiency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;. Magnesium deficiency can lead to several health concerns, including abnormal heart rhythms, hypertension, cardiac arrest, heart diseases, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Incorporating magnesium-rich foods into your diet is a simple way to bridge this gap. Here are five foods that are high in magnesium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dark chocolate &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good news for chocolate lovers. Yes, dark chocolate is a very rich source of magnesium. It provides about 65 mg per 1-ounce (28-gram) serving, which is roughly 14% of the Daily Value (DV). It is also rich in antioxidants, which may reduce inflammation and improve heart health. However, moderation is key due to its calorie and sugar content. Enjoy a square or two of dark chocolate as a dessert or shave it over oatmeal or yogurt. Pick high-quality brands with minimal added sugar to maximize benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Avocado&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocados can give you a daily dose of magnesium. It’s a solid source of magnesium. One medium avocado contains about 58 milligrams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avocados are rich in potassium, healthy fats, and fiber. This fruit si also good for heart health and digestion. Spread avocado on whole-grain toast, add slices to sandwiches, or blend into a creamy salad dressing. To boost the nutrients, pair avocado with a sprinkle of pumpkin seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Almonds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almonds are dense with magnesium. This nut has about 80 milligrams per ounce (roughly 23 almonds). They’re also packed with healthy fats, protein, and vitamin E, all great for a healthy heart. Regular nut consumption is also linked to improved cardiovascular health, partly due to magnesium’s role in regulating blood pressure. Consider having a handful of almonds between meals as a snack or sprinkle sliced almonds over yogurt or oatmeal. However, be mindful of portion sizes, as almonds are calorie-dense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Feeling Low?

One cup of cooked spinach delivers about 157 milligrams of magnesium, roughly 37% of the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for adults. Spinach is also rich in iron, vitamins A and C, and antioxidants. It can reduce oxidative stress and help reduce the effects of aging. You can toss fresh spinach leaves into salads with a sprinkle of nuts and berries for a nutrient boost. Or blend spinach into a smoothie with banana and almond milk for a tasty breakfast option. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Black beans&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legumes are especially high in magnesium. Black beans are an affordable, magnesium-rich option. They can provide about 120 milligrams of magnesium per cooked cup. They’re also high in fiber and protein, and hence beneficial for digestive health, and also promote satiety. Studies also suggest that legumes like black beans may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. Add black beans to tacos, burritos, or salads for a quick meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 01:40:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi8AFBVV95cUxPQk9vaktTUktMazhua2d6SXZBdW5VeUQwQ0xobEl3YlQ3SDNweVV2N1dLZmN1emhGU2dUTVU0czllekpROWRiQ2pRVHpSOFJVZFFkejEtZ05heUdZWDB6ck5xRzhXaGNLNXItMVhWSlRiVS01c3NUd2diRnRiamV1ZDNkWi1IekRLcU5ybVpEN3pwLUFHejViNlVHSE1EX0VnMEl2RlJtVWRYS0ZlOFRzUG1QS0kxYlc4QUh5SXJzX1Q0UVB1bUJQNGhIWGhrSEp6VkJpV1N6LXMyZUszaXBIM1Q5X0xmM1JmeDJ0ekpSQzQ</guid></item><item><title>科学家庆祝肠癌的突破，以应对年轻人的激增-独立报 | Scientists celebrate bowel cancer breakthrough in bid to tackle surge in young people - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikwFBVV95cUxNVl96SUVuaXJoVHNhZUtZekRRMFhnRFhubVNBQ3FHR3RwVUlGU3BHWUl1d2U5R3d5SVV1ZWRuLVAydXp1aHdXc2hsNGM2WWx4S2xpbFM0T0FuWTNFbXlZU2hUa0ZNaHYxMjJpbGNvVVNBbUdJeGRyUEFWNkdaeEZxZnN3LWFYZTBYOWpBVlFlREV0Zlk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 gryCYY sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 dFpFuY"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 dmMyEN"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 fXvmgM"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 juUDRT"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cqPbFA"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 rAFIl sc-hez36s-16 jZSKtc"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 PdmgT"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 hJPJVF"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 lcJUSj"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 laZbyn"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 cKWiEj"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

This &lt;a href="/topic/breakthrough"&gt;breakthrough&lt;/a&gt; offers hope for treating the increasing rates of the disease, especially among young people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study conducted by the Cancer Research UK Scotland Centre and the &lt;a href="/topic/university-of-edinburgh"&gt;University of Edinburgh&lt;/a&gt; revealed that a critical step in aggressive bowel cancer involves cells losing their original identity, a process known as cellular plasticity. Researchers found that the disease spreads when colonic cells begin to resemble squamous cells, which form skin, or muscle cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bowel cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the UK. It claims the lives of 16,800 people in Britain, including 1,700 in Scotland, every year and is increasingly being diagnosed in younger people internationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study by the American Cancer Society published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet Oncology&lt;/em&gt; showed early-onset bowel cancer rates in adults aged 25-49 are rising in 27 of 50 countries studied, and increasing faster in young women in Scotland and England than in young men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scotland is disproportionately affected with around 4,000 people diagnosed each year overall, according to Cancer Research UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest study found bowel cancer cells can adapt to resemble skin cells, which can tolerate much harsher day-to-day conditions due to their role and position protecting the outside of the body, and also muscle cells, both of which are more “robust”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hmmOgn sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 cXcwgU"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="2" class="sc-482ou5-0 hoqMLc"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/01/06/12/06084509-52691c3a-1b44-43b0-99a6-c40cc53989c9.jpg" srcset="https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/01/06/12/06084509-52691c3a-1b44-43b0-99a6-c40cc53989c9.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/01/06/12/06084509-52691c3a-1b44-43b0-99a6-c40cc53989c9.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="The study also examined a gene called Atrx which was already associated with aggressive forms of bowel cancer" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 ggpMaE inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 kJMYuf" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 dkRtZs inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-189956"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 hwVecx"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 bpFomM hgzWpY"&gt;The study also examined a gene called Atrx which was already associated with aggressive forms of bowel cancer&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 CXMrn"&gt; (Alamy/PA)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cellular plasticity was found to be an important element in bowel cancer metastasis – when it spreads and becomes harder to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers hope identifying this and preventing it could help make current treatments more effective and stop the disease from spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also examined a particular &lt;a href="/topic/gene"&gt;gene&lt;/a&gt; called Atrx which was already associated with aggressive forms of bowel cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using mice and human tissue samples, researchers found the loss of this gene resulted in increased metastatic tumours which spread from the bowel to the liver, lymph nodes and the diaphragm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key to the ability of these cells to spread is that they shed their identity of colonic cells and resembled squamous cells which form skin, or cells that resemble muscle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “Loss Of Colonic Fidelity Enables Multilineage Plasticity And Metastasis”, is published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;. The research received funding from the Medical Research Council and the European Research Council.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Kevin Myant, of the Institute of Genetics and Cancer at the University of Edinburgh and the Cancer Research UK Scotland Centre, said: “With more and more younger people being diagnosed with bowel cancer, it’s vital we understand how this disease grows and develops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our research has discovered one way that aggressive bowel cancer is able to spread is by ‘shapeshifting’ to resemble skin or muscle cells rather than bowel cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This finding will hopefully allow us to develop new treatments to stop these cells changing and prevent the cancer spreading, when it becomes much harder to treat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead researcher Dr Patrizia Cammareri said: “Skin cells can tolerate much harsher day-to-day conditions than other types of cells – due to their role and position protecting the outside of the body – so this may be a strategy to help the bowel cancer cells become more robust and enable them to spread around the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Metastasis is a leading cause of cancer death and a key focus for cancer research, so this finding could be pivotal in halting the progression of aggressive cancer and providing better outcomes for patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 cPCVUJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer Research UK director of research, Dr Catherine Elliott, said: “Diagnosing and treating cancer early and preventing spread to other parts of the body offers the best chance of a positive outcome for patients so research like this, which could lead to new ways to stop that spread, offers great hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bowel cancer is of increasing concern globally, which is why we invested £5.5m to the CRC-STARS initiative (Colorectal Cancer – Stratification of Therapies through Adaptive Responses) jointly led by our Cancer Research UK Scotland Institute, which will bring together more than 40 bowel cancer experts, including researchers who worked on this project, to find new and kinder ways to tackle this disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 22:56:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikwFBVV95cUxNVl96SUVuaXJoVHNhZUtZekRRMFhnRFhubVNBQ3FHR3RwVUlGU3BHWUl1d2U5R3d5SVV1ZWRuLVAydXp1aHdXc2hsNGM2WWx4S2xpbFM0T0FuWTNFbXlZU2hUa0ZNaHYxMjJpbGNvVVNBbUdJeGRyUEFWNkdaeEZxZnN3LWFYZTBYOWpBVlFlREV0Zlk</guid></item><item><title>奥克兰公司警告说，人们在罗切斯特山医疗办公室接触过麻疹-底特律新闻 | People were exposed to measles at a Rochester Hills medical office, Oakland Co. warns - The Detroit News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0wFBVV95cUxPR0ZzOFNYQmVqeG5fNXdodmZscHlISXREMXJTdkpTTEp3VS1SNkF5VzBGYTM2RTdsWFpMTW01OWJ4aUUxcHFheW1zaktyMGVkOWFjM3ptRXhOanplWUpCd25fZmlwUF9Pb3FTZllWcmN1SFZaM09VdFlKZW92c2l2UEY2U2xjZG9Ld3o1SUo4RnVoRzNwbFhYQk5yUUp2Y2hjRGdtcnZvdVAzOE95VjJ1elA4S2JZc3RtWVRET29LN0NIMVpYaTQwLUZ3eV9fZENJWWtn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People who visited a Rochester Hills medical office building last week may have been exposed to measles, the Oakland County Health Division warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Anyone who visited the medical office building at 3950 South Rochester Road between 8 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. on June 3 may have been exposed, the division said in a Friday press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;People who are considered high-risk — such as pregnant women, unvaccinated children under 5 and people with weakened immune systems — can seek immune globulin treatment, which is effective if administered within six days of exposure, the health division said. People who were exposed but are not high-risk should monitor for symptoms through June 24. If symptoms develop, they should call their health care provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Anyone who is unsure if they have been fully vaccinated or if they have had measles in the past also should contact their health care provider, the division said.

The state health department is monitoring for spread of the virus in the eastern Upper Peninsula, where people with measles may have exposed others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Nationwide, there have been 1,168 measles cases in the U.S. so far in 2025, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which updated its figures on June 6. There have been three confirmed deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Measles is a highly contagious disease that is spread through the air. The virus can live in the air for up to two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Symptoms of measles include high fever, coughing, a runny nose, conjunctivitis, a splotchy red rash and tiny white spots in the mouth.

                                            minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON — Novo Nordisk's popular weight-loss and diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic may in very rare cases cause a serious eye condition that can lead to vision loss, the European Medicines Agency's safety committee said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, studies in Type 2 diabetes patients have linked Ozempic to the condition called non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. But this is the first time a regulator has confirmed the side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The condition may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people taking semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic, as well as in Novo's other diabetes drug Rybelsus, for at least one year, the regulator said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eye condition is the second-most common cause of blindness due to optic nerve damage, after glaucoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This has been reported as a potential risk for some time, so I think the clinical community is relatively aware of it. I don't see this as making any major difference to prescribing patterns," said Barclays analyst Emily Field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S.-listed shares of the Danish drugmaker were up nearly 2.5% in early trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The safety agency, which started its review in December, has asked Novo to add the eye condition as a side effect of very rare frequency in the product information accompanying drugs that contain semaglutide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novo said it would work with the safety agency to update the labels, adding clinical trials and after-market studies did not suggest a reasonable possibility that the drugs caused the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "benefit-risk profile of semaglutide remains favorable," the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novo has recently faced investor concerns that it is losing its first-mover advantage in the highly competitive obesity treatment market, leading the company to oust CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wegovy and Eli Lilly's Zepbound currently dominate the weight-loss drug market, potentially worth about $150 billion by the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Medicines Agency's safety committee said several large studies in Type 2 diabetes patients have suggested that use of Novo's drugs could raise the risk of developing the eye condition by twofold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study of nearly 350,000 diabetes patients published in March showed that the risk of developing the eye condition more than doubled after two years of treatment with Ozempic, compared to patients taking medicines from other classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on whether the Food and Drug Administration was conducting a probe into the side effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contributing:&lt;/strong&gt; Manas Mishra&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

Drawing on data from more than 4,200 young adults in China, the research provides a detailed look at how family income, neighborhood adversity, and regional economic conditions relate to memory, personality traits, mental health, and brain imaging markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight that while early-life circumstances matter, socioeconomic conditions during adolescence and early adulthood may have a stronger influence on cognitive function and mental well-being. The study also identifies specific brain regions and functional networks that may help explain how socioeconomic experiences shape behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Socioeconomic status is widely known to influence a person’s physical and mental health. Lower status is linked to a range of conditions, including heart disease, depression, anxiety, and cognitive decline. But researchers have struggled to untangle the effects of different types of disadvantage—such as low family income, unsafe neighborhoods, or poor regional infrastructure—and to determine whether timing matters, for instance, whether early-life disadvantage has different effects than experiences later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complicating matters further, socioeconomic status is a broad and multidimensional concept. It includes not just income, but also education, occupation, social environment, and access to resources, all of which tend to be intertwined. This makes it difficult to determine which specific aspects of disadvantage are most influential—and when they matter most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this complexity, the researchers behind the new study set out to isolate the effects of different socioeconomic factors and time periods. Their goal was to determine how family, neighborhood, and regional economic conditions during childhood and adolescence shape adult brain and behavioral traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research used data from the Chinese Imaging Genetics (CHIMGEN) study, a large, nationwide investigation of healthy Chinese Han young adults aged 18 to 30. From an initial pool of more than 7,000 individuals, the researchers focused on 4,228 participants who had complete data on brain imaging, behavioral traits, and socioeconomic background. These participants were drawn from 30 different research centers across China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To capture socioeconomic conditions, the researchers collected information on 16 different indicators, including parental education and occupation, household income, family financial crises, neighborhood safety, and provincial-level resources like hospital beds and GDP. Each of these indicators was assessed for two life stages: early (ages 0–10) and late (ages 10+). This allowed the team to examine both the average effects of socioeconomic status over time and the distinct effects of early vs. later exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using statistical factor analysis, they grouped the 16 indicators into four broad dimensions of socioeconomic experience: family socioeconomic status, family adversity, neighborhood adversity, and provincial resources. Participants also completed a battery of tests assessing cognitive abilities, personality traits, and emotional well-being. In addition, they underwent advanced brain imaging, including MRI scans that measured brain structure and functional connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that different socioeconomic dimensions were linked to different aspects of brain and behavior. Family socioeconomic status—measured by income, parental education, and home resources—was strongly associated with cognitive performance and brain structure. In contrast, family adversity (such as unemployment or financial crisis) and neighborhood adversity (such as exposure to violence) were more strongly related to personality and emotional traits like neuroticism, impulsivity, and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These associations were not uniform across time. While both early and later-life socioeconomic factors showed links to brain and behavioral outcomes, the researchers found that late-stage experiences had particularly strong and unique effects. For example, higher family income and education during adolescence and early adulthood were linked to better memory and more open-minded personality traits, even after accounting for early-life conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of brain structure, higher family socioeconomic status was associated with greater volume in regions such as the cerebellum—linked to working memory—and lower volume in the medial prefrontal cortex, a region involved in self-reflection and social cognition. The researchers also found changes in white matter integrity and functional connectivity within key networks involved in executive function and attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, individuals with higher family socioeconomic status showed stronger functional connectivity in sensorimotor networks and weaker connectivity in default mode and frontoparietal networks. These differences in brain connectivity appeared to mediate the relationship between socioeconomic status and behavioral traits such as openness to experience and verbal memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the study also explored how changes in socioeconomic conditions over time—so-called “mobility effects”—relate to behavior. While these mobile-specific effects were not found in brain structure or connectivity, they did appear in behavior. For example, individuals who moved into more disadvantaged neighborhoods over time tended to show higher levels of neuroticism and impulsivity and lower levels of extraversion, suggesting that worsening social environments can negatively affect personality development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand how the brain might be involved in translating socioeconomic experiences into behavior, the researchers conducted mediation analyses. They found that changes in specific brain regions and networks helped explain some of the behavioral effects of socioeconomic status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, volume in a brain region that includes both the supplementary motor area and medial prefrontal cortex mediated the link between family socioeconomic status and verbal memory. Similarly, functional connectivity in the left frontoparietal network helped explain the association between higher socioeconomic status and greater openness to experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings point to possible neurobiological pathways through which socioeconomic factors influence cognition and personality, offering insights that could inform early interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study is large and comprehensive, it has several limitations. One issue is that the socioeconomic data were based on participants’ recall, which may be less reliable for early childhood. The data were also cross-sectional, meaning they capture a single point in time rather than tracking changes across development. This limits the ability to draw firm conclusions about causality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation is that the brain imaging data, while extensive, focused on specific types of structural and functional markers. Other brain mechanisms, such as neurotransmitter activity or fine-grained network dynamics, may also be involved in the links between socioeconomic experience and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, the study provides a more nuanced picture of how different types of socioeconomic disadvantage at different points in life influence the brain and behavior. It suggests that while early life matters, adolescence and young adulthood remain critical windows for improving life conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-01882-w" target="_blank"&gt;Distinct effects of early-stage and late-stage socioeconomic factors on brain and behavioral traits&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Qiang Xu, Su Lui, Yuan Ji, Jingliang Cheng, Long Jiang Zhang, Bing Zhang, Wenzhen Zhu, Zuojun Geng, Guangbin Cui, Quan Zhang, Weihua Liao, Yongqiang Yu, Hui Zhang, Bo Gao, Xiaojun Xu, Tong Han, Zhenwei Yao, Wen Qin, Feng Liu, Meng Liang, Jilian Fu, Jiayuan Xu, Peng Zhang, Wei Li, Dapeng Shi, Caihong Wang, Jia-Hong Gao, Zhihan Yan, Feng Chen, Jiance Li, Jing Zhang, Dawei Wang, Wen Shen, Yanwei Miao, Junfang Xian, Meiyun Wang, Zhaoxiang Ye, Xiaochu Zhang, Xi-Nian Zuo, Kai Xu, Shijun Qiu, Chunshui Yu, and The CHIMGEN Consortium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 20:12:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxOZEx4MkhiTlc4OUpjYWJzd2ZkcTFOWXJCR29EdzFZYWlXdHI5ZndPLW1VQURYMjRMWk9pUGlvQ0dRamdyMFpnWm95TVBaSHVnNzE3dGlBNEtRWXpJalNwQU85djE3MVg1SUE4X2d3b2NVMHMzSnpjV2w3RVF0elJubDBUcEdFV3JRX1pQTVJkMlppNGIxZTE3Nk9XZkw</guid></item><item><title>来自我们古老亲戚的200万年前的蛀牙揭示了人类进化的秘密-对话 | 2-million year-old pitted teeth from our ancient relatives reveal secrets about human evolution - The Conversation</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiygFBVV95cUxQNmpMNk1uS3ZzTkJrdEJGblBhaWdWOG5uTkdxOENha1c4WFBwS24tU2E3VVVnR3QybTBGdFdfT25HWUJEVV84eHVoSkxvbGNKTmV1eENlcldaWVFoRkkwNTU5V2d0XzZXekhJWDJpMVBwdUdsVGt3X0thcDZPVVdBeG9mWVl6N3dTQ3luNVlpbHB3MFNrZlZnLXpOVU1aZ1dQUFBzdnRUMmhCNmFNRmZ6RVlhNV91OHVkSEZiWXZGWEJfSzFEMXZtcEhB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The enamel that forms the outer layer of our teeth might seem like an unlikely place to find clues about evolution. But it tells us more than you’d think about the relationships between our fossil ancestors and relatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248425000569?via%3Dihub"&gt;our new study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the Journal of Human Evolution, we highlight a different aspect of enamel. In fact, we highlight its absence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we show that tiny, shallow pits in fossil teeth may not be signs of malnutrition or disease. Instead, they may carry surprising evolutionary significance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering why this matters. Well, for people like me who try to figure out how humans evolved and how all our ancestors and relatives were related to each other, teeth are very important. And having a new marker to look out for on fossil teeth could give us a new tool to help fit together our family tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Uniform, circular and shallow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These pits were first identified in the South African species &lt;em&gt;Paranthropus robustus&lt;/em&gt;, a close relative of our own genus &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt;. They are highly consistent in shape and size: uniform, circular and shallow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, we thought the pits might be unique to &lt;em&gt;P. robustus&lt;/em&gt;. But our latest research shows this kind of pitting also occurs in other &lt;em&gt;Paranthropus&lt;/em&gt; species in eastern Africa. We even found it in some &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/em&gt; individuals, a genus that may have given rise to both &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Paranthropus&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Uniform, circular and shallow pitting on teeth may be a previously undetected clue about evolutionary relationships.&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The enamel pits have commonly been assumed to be defects resulting from stresses such as illness or malnutrition during childhood. However, their remarkable consistency across species, time and geography suggests these enamel pits may be something more interesting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pitting is subtle, regularly spaced, and often clustered in specific regions of the tooth crown. It appears without any other signs of damage or abnormality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Two million years of evolution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked at fossil teeth from hominins (humans and our closest extinct relatives) from the Omo Valley in Ethiopia, where we can see traces of more than two million years of human evolution, as well as comparisons with sites in southern Africa (Drimolen, Swartkrans and Kromdraai).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Omo collection includes teeth attributed to &lt;em&gt;Paranthropus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt;, the three most recent and well-known hominin genera. This allowed us to track the telltale pitting across different branches of our evolutionary tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we found was unexpected. The uniform pitting appears regularly in both eastern and southern Africa &lt;em&gt;Paranthropus&lt;/em&gt;, and also in the earliest eastern African &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/em&gt; teeth dating back around 3 million years. But among southern Africa &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/em&gt; and our own genus, &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt;, the uniform pitting was notably absent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A defect … or just a trait?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the uniform pitting were caused by stress or disease, we might expect it to correlate with tooth size and enamel thickness, and to affect both front and back teeth. But it doesn’t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s more, stress-related defects typically form horizontal bands. They usually affect all teeth developing at the time of the stress, but this is not what we see with this pitting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/672726/original/file-20250606-62-lzlgu2.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;The uniform, even nature of the pitting suggests a genetic origin rather than environmental factors such as malnutrition or disease.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047248425000569?via%3Dihub"&gt;Towle et al. / Journal of Human Evolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We think this pitting probably has a developmental and genetic origin. It may have emerged as a byproduct of changes in how enamel was formed in these species. It might even have some unknown functional purpose. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, we suggest these uniform, circular pits should be viewed as a trait rather than a defect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A modern comparison&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further support for the idea of a genetic origin comes from comparisons with a rare condition in humans today called amelogenesis imperfecta, which affects enamel formation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About one in 1,000 people today have amelogenesis imperfecta. By contrast, the uniform pitting we have seen appears in up to half of &lt;em&gt;Paranthropus&lt;/em&gt; individuals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it likely has a genetic basis, we argue the even pitting is too common to be considered a harmful disorder. What’s more, it persisted at similar frequencies for millions of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A new evolutionary marker&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this uniform pitting really does have a genetic origin, we may be able to use it to trace evolutionary relationships. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already use subtle tooth features such as enamel thickness, cusp shape, and wear patterns to help identify species. The uniform pitting may be an additional diagnostic tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, our findings support the idea that &lt;em&gt;Paranthropus&lt;/em&gt; is a “monophyletic group”, meaning all its species descend from a (relatively) recent common ancestor, rather than evolving seperatly from different &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/em&gt; taxa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we did not find this pitting in the southern Africa species &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus africanus&lt;/em&gt;, despite a large sample of more than 500 teeth. However, it does appear in the earliest Omo &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/em&gt; specimens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So perhaps the pitting could also help pinpoint from where &lt;em&gt;Paranthropus&lt;/em&gt; branched off on its own evolutionary path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An intriguing case&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One especially intriguing case is &lt;em&gt;Homo floresiensis&lt;/em&gt;, the so-called “hobbit” species from Indonesia. Based on published images, their teeth appear to show similar pitting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If confirmed, this could suggest an evolutionary history more closely tied to earlier &lt;em&gt;Australopithecus&lt;/em&gt; species than to &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt;. However, &lt;em&gt;H. floresiensis&lt;/em&gt; also shows potential skeletal and dental pathologies, so more research is needed before drawing such conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More research is also needed to fully understand the processes behind the uniform pitting before it can be used routinely in taxonomic work. But our research shows it is likely a heritable characteristic, one not found in any living primates studied to date, nor in our own genus &lt;em&gt;Homo&lt;/em&gt; (rare cases of amelogenesis imperfecta aside). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, it offers an exciting new tool for exploring evolutionary relationships among fossil hominins.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

          &lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was an accountant in my previous life (before 6 years studying meteorology and then a 20-year career in it), so you’d think I would have planned this out better. I had a decent salary for much of my meteorology career, and had a good retirement plan, including an employer match of up to 10% of my salary. However, my depression (and maybe some neurological/brain issues) got the better of me, and I had to retire 2 1/2 years before I intended to, right before the COVID-19 pandemic started in March 2020. So we had that to deal with, a $35K loss of income (went on Social Security/Medicare and started to take retirement income from my 401(k)). My husband stepped up and got a great job to almost make up the difference, even while starting dialysis at the same time. That brings us to now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a gay man who has been with the same guy (Ken) for 25+ years. We tied the knot as soon as Maryland voters approved same-sex marriage in 2013. Now, it’s 2025, and a different time. But politics is only a small part of what we are concerned about right now, and our concerns go even beyond my husband’s (Ken) End-Stage-Kidney-Disease (ESKD). Three months ago, he developed a hearing problem as a side effect from necessary and extended antibiotics use. We seem to have the hearing loss under control now, fortunately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, he now is suddenly losing his sight. This started with his right eye a couple of weeks ago, and now his left eye is &lt;strong&gt;also &lt;/strong&gt;giving him similar problems. Unlike the hearing, there is no known cause for this loss of eyesight. Another thing … it’s next to impossible to get timely appointments with any specialists these days, even with something I would consider an emergency! Until now, he’s persevered working full-time with a good salary, but he just can’t cope with all the physical issues he’s experiencing now. He likely will have to go out on SSDI which, beside being &lt;strong&gt;very difficult&lt;/strong&gt; to apply for, is a pittance. We will lose about $65K in income, and we still have a mortgage. He has some money put away for retirement, but that wasn’t going to be touched for about 7 more years!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What Are We Looking For? ADVICE!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our main concerns are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How do we navigate applying for SSDI, especially with the current regime? &lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Are these places that take your house “as is”, legit? Hopefully we won’t have to go that route, but I’m currently not even close to being sure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels like a million questions that I have, and I’m at my wits’ end regarding being supportive of him and us. The one thing I know is that I have to take care of myself to be able to take care of him. That’s no easy feat with my depression default setting :-/.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s about it for now and, as you might imagine, the current state of the U.S. is not helping at all.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Kos</author><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2025 20:08:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijAFBVV95cUxNVEZIN1dQYms4eHItOW9sVEpNSThJRzNDNll2d1g5Slo3Rl9NNmFjSGNkdlNkY2c1Qnd6ZmpjOE8tY2tTNGVSS0FDR0MyYkpLekdYa0FWRExBQmNNSzRHYVFYTFYtWUxtOHljYnRpZUFQVGlaS1A3UUVLZHpjVEs5UzVrR3Q1cEhnZklVMw</guid></item><item><title>专家说，平均阴茎尺寸增加了—而Ozempic可能是罪魁祸首-纽约邮报 | Average penis size has increased — and Ozempic could be to blame, experts say - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxNS0ZyRUc1WHdHckxuTndWbWF1aXl4LWhfaTRJU2g3YmhCc2ZydnRrb2xDd3d6RncyVDA2Yy0zWWpfMG9IWkdpeUJCMWUzbWpXaXB0VXl0OVcxLU1PRkh6X1Q0ckwtdXpYVUpQXzBISmFvR2U3M0FlV2dGZlk0ZUtGdmc4ak5zM1NVeTJSeW1xTDBMWXpYZExDUW52NFRmNTAzVnN6R0h3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;Ozempic might shrink waistlines, but it seems to bulge another body part.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1kjj9gi/increased_size_anybody_else_notice_men_only/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/06/07/lifestyle/ozempic-penis-male-users-reveal-shocking-change-to-their-genitalia-after-injecting-weight-loss-shot/"&gt;male Ozempic users&lt;/a&gt; claimed that the weight-loss drugs helped their penises grow. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I recently measured myself down there and noticed I gained about one inch,” a person proudly shared on the forum.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although there hasn’t been enough research done on the correlation between &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/06/06/health/ozempic-users-twice-as-likely-to-develop-debilitating-condition/"&gt;semaglutide&lt;/a&gt; and men’s genitalia measurements — the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2023/12/30/health/men-stunned-as-size-of-average-penis-is-revealed-and-its-smaller-than-you-think/"&gt;average penis size&lt;/a&gt; is continuing to rise, and some experts think &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/06/03/lifestyle/ozempic-fans-flock-to-most-unhealthy-bottled-drink/"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; might actually have something to do with it. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The average penis has grown nearly 10% from 5.17 inches to 5.63 between 2022 and 2024 in the UK, according to &lt;a href="https://www.diabetes.co.uk/news/2024/jun/average-penis-size-in-the-uk-has-risen-due-to-ozempic-data-suggests.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;diabetes.co&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they’re not the only ones seeing this increase.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;The data also revealed that Venezuelan men experienced a massive increase from 1.42 inches to 6.67 inches, within those two years. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dr. Richard Viney, a consultant urological surgeon at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, thinks Ozempic and similar drugs could be to blame.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Men’s penises shorten as they get older (due to) increasing body fat and increasing prostate size drawing the penis back into the body,” he told diabetes.co.&lt;/p&gt;

885px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dr. Richard Viney thinks weight-loss drugs, like Ozempic could be to blame for increased penis size.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Christopher Sadowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It is theoretically possible that new drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy, which are used to treat diabetes and obesity, respectively and can cause people to lose weight, could also be a factor. As men lose weight, their penises appear larger.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;However, in 2023, research published in the World Journal of Men’s Health revealed that the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/23/lifestyle/does-size-matter-age-old-penis-debate-finally-settled-in-groundbreaking-study/"&gt;average size of what a guy is packing&lt;/a&gt; has grown 24% over nearly 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And that sort of increase has health experts concerned — especially because even two years ago, they couldn’t put their finger on what the cause of it is. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Speculation around weight loss drugs being the culprit is possible — but the Ozempic trend is recent, and this growth for men has clearly been going on for some time now. &lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“Any overall change in development is concerning, because our reproductive system is one of the most important pieces of human biology,” Dr. Michael Eisenberg, the study’s author, told Stanford Medicine’s blog Scope.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If we’re seeing this fast of a change, it means that something powerful is happening to our bodies.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other possible causes could be chemical exposure from pesticides or hygiene products, Eisenberg hypothesized, which can disrupt the hormone-regulating endocrine system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Time will only tell if Ozempic or other lifestyle factors are to blame for well-endowed men. &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/23/lifestyle/does-size-matter-age-old-penis-debate-finally-settled-in-groundbreaking-study/#"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
