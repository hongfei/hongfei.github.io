or people who have had past surgical complications to avoid an elective operation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, Dr Charles Lee, a board-certified plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills, has revealed why certain people shouldn't get plastic surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span class="mol-style-bold"&gt;Below, DailyMail.com details the people Dr Lee says should avoid cosmetic procedures and why. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;People with body dysmorphia &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Nearly two percent of Americans have been diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder as of 2024&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Body dysmorphic disorder is a mental health condition that causes you to excessively and obsessively criticize perceived defects or flaws in your appearance that are usually minor or non-existent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The person's fixation is far beyond the typical dissatisfaction people may have - like wanting to lose 5lbs - and can cause a person to constantly feel embarrassed, ashamed and anxious to the point they avoid social situations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Charles Lee, a board certified plastic surgeon explained why certain people should not get plastic surgery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nearly two percent of Americans have been diagnosed with BDD as of 2024, according to National Alliance of Eating Disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As a result, people suffering from body dysmorphia may seek out plastic surgery as a solution to fix their imperfections, but in one &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drlee90210/video/7130480675517517098?lang=en"&gt;TikTok video&lt;/a&gt;, Dr Lee advises them not to do so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The expert explained: 'So someone who looks at a perfectly normal part of their body but they see a big problem, you're not going to get that fixed with surgery that really needs to be taken care of.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Instead of plastic surgery, doctors suggest seeking out mental health professionals who can help evaluate the situation and suggest appropriate treatment such as therapy and medications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Control freaks and perfectionists&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Lee added that people who are extremely particular in life and cannot bear slight asymmetries should not undergo procedures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Perfectionists and control freaks tend to have a strong drive for flawlessness, which can lead to unrealistic expectations about the outcome of plastic surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But, there is always a risk of complications or flaws when it comes to cosmetic procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In cases of a rhinoplasty (nose job) and eyelid surgery, it is normal to expect a bit of unevenness. However this may cause extreme disappointment among perfectionists - causing them to book more appointments and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Lee added that people who are extremely particular in life and cannot bear slight asymmetries should not undergo procedures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Lee explained: 'Surgery is not that precise, and if you can't accept a few millimeters off here and there, you should not get plastic surgery, especially the more precise procedures, such as rhinoplasty or eyelid surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'A fraction of a millimeter can be seen, but a surgeon can't necessarily correct all that, plus we have some asymmetries that cannot be corrected as well.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The specialist also noted plastic surgery requires a 'lot of patience and a lot of ability to accept the unknown'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'You're going to be swollen for a while. You're going to heal a certain way. Nobody can predict exactly how the outcome is going to be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We have a general idea, but it's in the 95 percent precision rate and that last five  percent is kind of random and you have to be willing to accept that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'And you may not know for six months, 12 months, sometimes two years, what the final result is.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;People with delusional expectations  &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over the last few years, social media has convinced people that plastic surgery can completely 'fix' their problems and make them look perfect. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Dr Lee highlighted that people who have a tendency to bleed easily during surgery should avoid an elective operation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But Dr Lee says this is unrealistic and people shouldn't expect instant gratification. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's important to understand it is impossible for plastic surgery to completely alter facial and bodily structures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The surgeon revealed: 'I've had a lot of cosmetic surgery myself. I had rhinoplasty, chin implant, whatever. I can't go into surgery expecting to look like Tom Cruise, no matter how much surgery I get.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He also emphasized it is extremely important for patients to be grounded in reality as plastic surgery ideally cannot reverse signs of aging, improve relationships or alter any negative thought patterns about your body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mol-para-with-font mol-style-subhead health-ccox"&gt;Easy bleeders&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lastly, Dr Lee highlighted that people who have a tendency to bleed easily or excessively should opt out of elective surgeries.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He explained that 'one in 10 people' have a tendency to bleed during surgery and while those with milder conditions, such as vitamin K deficiency, should treat those before seeking treatment, but other 'severe bleeders' need to be careful. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Conditions such as hemophilia - a condition where blood does not clot - and Von Willebrand disease - a genetic bleeding disorder caused by low levels of a clotting protein - may lead to prolonged and difficult-to-control bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;An accumulation of cigarette smoke in the chest can also cause issues during the healing process&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Frequent cigarette smoking and excessive alcohol consumption can also cause issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alcohol can cause blood to thin and an accumulation of cigarette smoke in the chest can lead to complications during the healing process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Lee explained: 'The big thing that we worry about related to bleeding during surgery is substance abuse, including cigarettes.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'That's a huge one, because cigarette smoke and other smoke, but cigarette in particular has nicotine and carbon monoxide, tar, things that really clog up the oxygen flow to the healing areas and that can cause necrosis, meaning tissue death, poor scarring and a bad outcome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So you really should not smoke for almost any of these elective procedures. Alcohol, there's another one. Red wine causes bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Other types of alcohol can prolong the swelling phase, and sometimes, if it's swollen for too long of a period, you're not going to get a good result.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 20:12:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQVHkydkpVZGlCclRYV2xFV1dNZWFoRDNPOUpQOGpJaXRrb2dlSkxKN2FVLWhlaWtfS3V1N0RzVlJrX0Etekd5dTViV0dnaVE1bU9oRzR6X0d2ZmdUUEhuN0p6YVpTRm5RODNudWc3Q0VoalpnVVZmY3ZFX0tYeDRqZmxIZXpHb2ltcHlzN1hoLTNIdkw5OW5Za3ZMNUs0UdIBowFBVV95cUxPMXNoVDBKems4OExiVGhqaFN5djRBWmxCV1NOQlU4RWtJQXhDeGZvbExxZXU1S3JPc1JxVy1wX2pxbHZaMVM4X2dPNmxoUWNFemdzeWRCUmZzWmh0cG4wVTYwZ2Y5UEpfLVppSklmU1NBMHMtZVRYRFVhdC1yNVZFX2pBWGdnYkZHYXRua2MyZkpLakVoamQyVmpxS0RfM1hvZ3Q4</guid></item><item><title>A Massive New Study About Seed Oils May Change How You Eat - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE8zTm5DQU1uemtMckxhN2JvTmdwRmpROWxhZ3gzUnhsbWl6SnljZ1Zrclk1NkxWRUF0VE1KVHEzMGdxcVpYSFdOVHlzUXFTLVg3OUVlMHlwVFg0Ym1rVndVblFFVzdKUEk3bFBvZ08zbw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;What the Science Says on Dietary Fat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Lisovskaya&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ONE OF THE&lt;/strong&gt; most divisive nutrition topics right now—and &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a63448441/red-dye-number-three-ban/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:there;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;there&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a64161967/artificial-dyes-ban-rfk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:are;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;are&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;a &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a63603209/is-beef-tallow-actually-good-for-you/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lot;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a45997622/is-raw-milk-good-for-you/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:them;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;them&lt;/a&gt;—is fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the recent arguments have centered on the supposed dangers of &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/nutrition/a63240441/are-seed-oils-actually-bad-for-you/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:seed oils;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;seed oils&lt;/a&gt;.

The two topics are linked: The anti-seed-oils faction has turned to saturated fats as a replacement, based on the belief that these fats are more “natural.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to a new study &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2831265" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:in JAMA Internal Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which looked at the association between varying consumption levels of either butter or plant-based oils (aka seed oils), and mortality levels, &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a63096101/signs-of-heart-disease-in-men/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:heart disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a43774213/good-news-about-cancer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cancer;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; incidence over the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using data from the &lt;a href="https://nurseshealthstudy.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nurse’s Health Study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nurse’s Health Study&lt;/a&gt;, a large-scale study started in 1976, researchers analyzed the dietary habits of more than 220,000 adults. They collected the data through participants’ food frequency recalls to determine the amount of butter and/or plant-based oils in the participants’ diets over the course of roughly 30 years. (Researchers included safflower, soybean, corn, canola, and olive oils in the “plant-based” oils group.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results were consistent with what previous research has already shown: People who ate the most butter had a 12% higher risk of developing cancer, and a 15% higher risk for all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, the subjects who ate the most plant-based oils had a 16% lower risk for all-cause mortality, a 6% lower risk of death from heart disease, and 11% lower risk for cancer, which compounded the more plant-based oils were consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers also found that substituting just 10 grams of butter a day—which is less than a tablespoon—for plant-based oil, &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/dietary-habits-study-suggests-more-plant-oils-less-butter-lead-to-better-health" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:led to a 17% reduction in cancer deaths and all-cause mortality;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;led to a 17% reduction in cancer deaths and all-cause mortality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These conclusions seem aligned with what other studies have found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However—and this is a big HOWEVER—there are some caveats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, it’s virtually impossible to draw a definitive link between specific diets—&lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; in a population—and health outcomes over time. Scientists just can’t keep people in a controlled lab environment for years of their lives. For long-term research like this, we have to rely on self-reported food intake, and at least some of that data may be inaccurate: People can forget, omit, or even lie about what they’ve been eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, other factors may muddle the link. People who eat more butter, for instance, may also do more of &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; things that increase their risk for disease. They may eat a more processed diet, be more sedentary, or be more likely &lt;a href="https://www.menshealth.com/health/a35213467/quitting-cigarettes-how-i-did-it/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:to smoke;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;to smoke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third, people's diets tend to change over time. (While researchers had participants fill out food frequency forms every four years, is this enough data to show the true nature of each person’s intake? Maybe or maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Good Food, Bad Diet&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1982137509?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2141.a.64255411%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$12.05 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$12.05 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fourth, all of the participants in the study were nurses. Do they represent the general population? Also maybe or maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the potential flaws in nutrition research as a whole, dietitians like myself look for reproducible effects and patterns. If we keep getting the same results over a series of similar studies, it’s likely that there is a true effect happening. In this case, it’s highly likely that a diet high in saturated fats is associated with a greater risk for disease and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean we all need to avoid saturated fat; it simply means that a diet containing a mix of fats is probably the best for health (with the exception of trans fats, which are definitely harmful).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means favoring unsaturated fats (including seed oils like canola and soybean) &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; adding in some saturated fats like butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might not be the next hot food trend, but it’s the most effective and sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 15:35:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE8zTm5DQU1uemtMckxhN2JvTmdwRmpROWxhZ3gzUnhsbWl6SnljZ1Zrclk1NkxWRUF0VE1KVHEzMGdxcVpYSFdOVHlzUXFTLVg3OUVlMHlwVFg0Ym1rVndVblFFVzdKUEk3bFBvZ08zbw</guid></item><item><title>Oregon Man Sues Pet Food Company for Allegedly Killing His Cats With Bird Flu - Gizmodo</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirAFBVV95cUxQQjlkR0wzVjk4cVJWblJTNlhfUmgwRFlOYUUycTh1bzFlZHltZndzbi1XeVd4YUJyZkVrenNWaGU0eXJYVzFmUHhMUFREd1hJM01RUFpjMDFjOXBvYXFVMDczYTlqOXg1OHlkTHZPX25iLXhSX21KaGVsdUVtV3BORXFSd3Q2ek5NbjFSaXEwMFdzQU1pYWlucUQwNkNEd0Qtd000Wkt0R251ZEVY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-lg lg:leading-[29px] font-serif max-w-none"&gt;
              
              
              &lt;p&gt;A man in Oregon filed a lawsuit against Wild Coast Pet Food this week after his cat died from bird flu. The suit alleges the company misled consumers when it sold raw chicken cat food as healthy, failing to acknowledge potential risks, such as potential death from the consumption of H5N1-infected food.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed by Tim Hanson, seeks just under $8,000 in damages which covers compensation for veterinarian bills and legal fees, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/regional/portland-man-sues-wild-coast-pet-food-cat-dies-bird-flu/283-983181c4-2d7f-4549-8239-6e72d29d4386"&gt;KTVB 7&lt;/a&gt; in Oregon. Hanson adopted his cat Kira in 2021 and told the news outlet he typically feeds his cats raw food like the chicken that killed his cat because “I believe in the health benefits of it.” It’s not entirely clear what health benefits Hanson believes can come from raw chicken.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hanson told KTVB 7 he bought the Wild Coast Pet Foods brand cat food in January but one day in early February Kira stopped eating. Hanson told the news outlet he brought her to the vet on Feb. 5 and a few days later tests confirmed Kira had bird flu.  Kira was so sick she had to be euthanized on Feb. 9.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wild Coast, which is based in Washington, issued a recall on March 1 for its 16 oz and 24 oz frozen Boneless Free Range Chicken Formula raw pet food for cats. The food was sold in Washington and Oregon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The warning from the recall, which was posted on the FDA’s website:&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who fed pets the recalled products should watch for symptoms of bird flu in their pets, including fever, lethargy, low appetite, reddened or inflamed eyes, discharge from the eyes and nose, difficulty breathing, and neurological signs like tremors, stiff body movements, seizure, lack of coordination, or blindness. People with pets exhibiting these signs after feeding this product should contact their veterinarian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The spread of bird flu has been devastating for many cat owners, as they seem to be the most susceptible among domestic animals outside birds to H5N1. Many cats from New York to Oregon have been documented to have died from the disease and there are likely many more deaths that are going undetected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No humans in the U.S. have contracted bird flu from eating food, at least as far as health authorities can tell. But it does appear that cats are getting it from the consumption of raw food. U.S. health agencies have tested both milk and beef and it appears both are safe for human consumption even with the presence of bird flu as long as the milk is pasteurized and the beef is cooked to at least medium.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There’s also no evidence of human-to-human spread of the bird flu in the U.S. but there is concern a mutation could allow that to happen. There have been 70 cases of H5N1 documented in Americans with one death. Forty-one of those cases have been tied to dairy cattle, 24 have been traced to poultry farms, two cases are from backyard flocks and wild birds, and three cases are still unknown sources.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wild Coast didn’t respond to questions emailed Friday.

			&lt;p&gt;Researchers have suspected for&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-evidence-suggests-parkinson-s-might-start-in-the-gut-before-spreading-to-the-brain"&gt; some time&lt;/a&gt; that the link between our gut and brain plays a role in the development of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IYl" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73029" data-postid="155632" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Parkinson's&lt;/a&gt; disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study identified gut microbes likely to be involved and linked them with decreased &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin"&gt;riboflavin&lt;/a&gt; ( &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="155632" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamin&lt;/a&gt; B2) and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotin"&gt;biotin&lt;/a&gt; (vitamin B7), pointing the way to an unexpectedly &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/9wuwZbPf0Vs"&gt;simple treatment that may help&lt;/a&gt;: B  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/what-are-vitamins-and-do-we-really-need-to-take-them" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73116" data-postid="155632" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;vitamins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Supplementation of riboflavin and/or biotin is likely to be beneficial in a subset of Parkinson's disease patients, in which gut dysbiosis plays pivotal roles," Nagoya University medical researcher Hiroshi Nishiwaki and colleagues &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41531-024-00724-z"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in their paper published in May 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9wuwZbPf0Vs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neurodegenerative disease impacts &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/parkinson-disease"&gt;almost 10 million people globally&lt;/a&gt;, who at best can hope for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-is-the-first-time-drug-shows-signs-of-slowing-parkinsons-disease"&gt;therapies that slow and alleviate symptoms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms typically begin with constipation and sleep problems, up to 20 years before progressing into dementia and the debilitating loss of muscle control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/changes-in-gut-bacteria-are-present-long-before-signs-of-parkinsons-appear"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; found people with Parkinson's disease also experience changes in their microbiome long before other signs appear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_131231" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-131231" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/SHakingHandPIckingUpGlass-1.jpg" alt="Hands picking up a glass" class="size-full wp-image-131231" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/SHakingHandPIckingUpGlass-1.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/SHakingHandPIckingUpGlass-1-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/SHakingHandPIckingUpGlass-1-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-131231" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Parkinson's disease impacts almost 10 million people globally.

&lt;p&gt;While different groups of bacteria were involved in the different countries examined, they all influenced pathways that synthesize B vitamins in the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found the changes in gut bacteria communities were associated with a decrease in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riboflavin"&gt;riboflavin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotin"&gt;biotin&lt;/a&gt; in people with Parkinson's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_145467" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-145467" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/ParkinsonsGutBVitamins642.jpg" alt="Graphic of human gut-brain connection and B vitamins" class="size-full wp-image-145467" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/ParkinsonsGutBVitamins642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/ParkinsonsGutBVitamins642-603x415.jpg 603w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/12/ParkinsonsGutBVitamins642-600x413.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-145467" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;In Parkinson's disease, a reduction in the gut bacteria of genes responsible for synthesizing the essential B vitamins B2 and B7 was found.

&lt;p&gt;"Deficiencies in polyamines and SCFAs could lead to thinning of the intestinal mucus layer, increasing intestinal permeability, both of which have been observed in Parkinson's disease," Nishiwaki &lt;a href="https://www.nagoya-u.ac.jp/researchinfo/result-en/2024/06/20240618-01.html"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_131227" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-131227" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/GraphicOfParkinsonsVitaminBConnection642.jpg" alt="A graphic depicting the process of gut bacteria depleting B vitamins and leading to symptoms of Parkinson's disease" class="wp-image-131227 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/GraphicOfParkinsonsVitaminBConnection642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/GraphicOfParkinsonsVitaminBConnection642-280x415.jpg 280w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/GraphicOfParkinsonsVitaminBConnection642-600x888.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-131227" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Summary of findings from the study and speculations from previous research. (Nishiwaki et al., &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41531-024-00724-z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;npj Parkinson's Disease&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 2024)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They suspect the weakened protective layer exposes the intestinal nervous system to more of the toxins we now encounter more regularly. These include &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/dry-cleaning-chemical-could-be-major-cause-of-parkinsons-scientists-warn"&gt;cleaning chemicals,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/two-pathways-to-parkinsons-could-point-to-a-single-way-to-prevent-it"&gt;pesticides&lt;/a&gt;, and herbicides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such toxins lead to the overproduction of α-synuclein fibrils – molecules &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbd.2024.106411"&gt;known to amass&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-test-detects-parkinsons-7-years-before-most-symptoms-show"&gt;dopamine-producing cells&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-pinpoint-exactly-which-brain-cells-die-in-parkinson-s-disease"&gt;substantia nigra&lt;/a&gt; part of our brains, and increased nervous system inflammation, eventually leading to the more debilitating motor and dementia symptoms of Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.scielo.br/j/bjmbr/a/BM4WLJBtjxF8Cx3wFsjFhKb/?lang=en"&gt;2003 study&lt;/a&gt; found high doses of riboflavin can assist in recovering some motor functions in patients who also eliminated red meat from their diets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it's possible that high doses of vitamin B may prevent some of the damage, Nishiwaki and team propose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_131228" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-131228" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/06/VitaminBInBlood642.jpg" alt="Illustration of a vitamin B2 molecule in the blood.

(Nemes Laszlo/Science Photo Library/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This all suggests ensuring patients have healthy gut microbiomes may also prove protective, as would &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/parkinsons-disease/can-environmental-toxins-cause-parkinson-disease"&gt;reducing the toxic pollutants&lt;/a&gt; in our environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, with such a complicated chain of events involved in Parkinson's disease, not all patients likely experience the same causes, so each individual would need to be assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We could perform gut microbiota analysis on patients or conduct fecal metabolite analysis," &lt;a href="https://www.nagoya-u.ac.jp/researchinfo/result-en/2024/06/20240618-01.html"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt; Nishiwak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Using these findings, we could identify individuals with specific deficiencies and administer oral riboflavin and biotin supplements to those with decreased levels, potentially creating an effective treatment."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41531-024-00724-z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;npj Parkinson's Disease&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in June 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Kennedy Jr. took aim at a new target this week as part of his “Make America Healthy Again” agenda: cell phones in schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6370269070112" target="_blank"&gt;an interview with “Fox &amp;amp; Friends”&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday, Kennedy praised &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/state-lawmakers-bills-ban-cellphones-schools-rcna187309" target="_blank"&gt;cell phone restrictions in schools&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/rfk-jr-health-stances-vaccines-fluoride-raw-milk-rcna180244" target="_blank"&gt;listed health hazards&lt;/a&gt; that he said were linked to phone use among children and teens  — some backed by scientific research, others less so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy cited established links between social media use and depression and poor school performance. But he also suggested that cell phones “produce electromagnetic radiation, which has been shown to do neurological damage to kids when it’s around them all day, and to cause cellular damage and even cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Studies have found that excessive use of social media via smartphones can &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2749480" target="_blank"&gt;negatively impact teens’ mental health&lt;/a&gt;, elevating their risk of depression and anxiety. Scientists have also long understood that cell phone use in school &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11894741/" target="_blank"&gt;can lead to poor academic performance&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563213003993" target="_blank"&gt;lower grades&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, the bulk of research so far has found no association between cell phone use and cancer, nor evidence that cell phones damage DNA. Cell phones emit radio frequency radiation, which has far less energy than ionizing radiation, such as that released by medical X-rays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy’s statements follow a pattern of his, in which he mixes misinformation with scientific fact. Some of the issues he has highlighted &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/kennedy-first-month-health-secretary-vaccines-food-additives-rcna196042" target="_blank"&gt;during his first five-plus weeks in office&lt;/a&gt;, such as reducing chronic disease in children and warning of the dangers of ultraprocessed food, have broad support among the public and many scientists. But certain factors Kennedy blames for those problems and some of his proposed solutions — such as substituting &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/influencers-claim-beef-tallow-health-beauty-benefits-not-necessarily-e-rcna195206" target="_blank"&gt;beef tallow&lt;/a&gt; for seed oils in fast food — are not backed by research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;So, too, for cell phones in schools. Restricting their use is an issue leaders have embraced on both sides of the aisle. Vivek Murthy, while he was surgeon general under the Biden Administration last year, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/opinion/social-media-health-warning.html" target="_blank"&gt;called on schools to get rid of phones in the classroom&lt;/a&gt;. Nine states have already enacted such &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/mental-health/issue-brief/a-look-at-state-efforts-to-ban-cellphones-in-schools-and-implications-for-youth-mental-health/" target="_blank"&gt;bans or restrictions&lt;/a&gt;, and 15 states and Washington, D.C. have introduced legislation to do so, according to KFF, a nonprofit health think tank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Both in red states and blue states, there’s a lot of concern about kids and cell phones, so I do think that there is bipartisan support on this,” said Annette Campbell Anderson, deputy director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Safe and Healthy Schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, there’s no reason to fear a cancer risk from using your cell phone at this time, said Jerrold Bushberg, a clinical professor of radiation oncology at the University of California, Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There’s a lot of low-quality research in the literature that, if you wanted to collect all that and put it together, it would look very damning,” he said. “There are many activist groups out there that promote those studies and say that that’s the truth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;An HHS spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;What Kennedy says, and what studies say&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kennedy has made repeated, unsubstantiated claims about the physical harms of cell phone use in the past, including &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3DQfcTY4viyXsIXQ89NXvg" target="_blank"&gt;on Joe Rogan’s podcast&lt;/a&gt; last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;At his confirmation hearing in January, Kennedy also told Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., that he stood by his past statements that WiFi radiation causes cancer, saying that he had “won a case in front of the Court of Appeals against the FCC on that very issue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The anti-vaccine group that Kennedy founded, Children’s Health Defense, challenged the Federal Communications Commission’s decision not to review its 1996 health and safety guidelines for wireless-based technologies. An appeals court &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/search-filings/filing/1041748778173" target="_blank"&gt;ruled in favor of the plaintiffs&lt;/a&gt; and ordered the FCC to explain how its guidelines protect against potentially harmful health effects. However, that case was about health issues unrelated to cancer, and the court did not take a position on the potential health effects of cell phone radiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Research thus far has been “very reassuring” about cell phone safety, Bushberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Most studies have examined whether exposure to radiation from cell phones could increase the risk of brain tumors, given that people often hold their phone by their head while talking. But overall brain cancer rates haven’t risen as cell phones have become more widely used. And &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34974237/" target="_blank"&gt;a large study&lt;/a&gt; among children found no association between wireless phone use and brain tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/cell-phones-fact-sheet" target="_blank"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/cell-phones/do-cell-phones-pose-health-hazard" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/radtown/non-ionizing-radiation-wireless-technology" target="_blank"&gt;Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt; — agencies that Kennedy now oversees — have all said there’s not enough scientific evidence to associate cell phone use with cancer. However, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified radio frequency radiation as possibly carcinogenic, meaning it cannot rule out a causal link. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Several questions remain, said David McCormick, a biology professor at Illinois Institute of Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I think it’s fairly clear that Mr. Kennedy doesn’t necessarily pay much attention to the bulk of the scientific data that is out there. That said, it’s not impossible that there are health effects from people using cell phones,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29217849/" target="_blank"&gt;2017 study&lt;/a&gt;, McCormick and his fellow researchers exposed rodents to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29217848/" target="_blank"&gt;radio frequency radiation&lt;/a&gt; and found a possible increased rate of certain tumors — however, findings in lab animals don’t necessarily apply to humans, given the many biological differences, and the studies contained limitations that prevented the researchers from drawing conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A decade earlier, a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17636416/" target="_blank"&gt;study looked at cell phone use&lt;/a&gt; among more than 5,000 people with brain tumors and found a possible increased risk of tumors in the 10% who used their phones the most. But the research relied on people’s memories about past phone use, which aren’t always reliable, so its results (like those of similar studies) are hard to interpret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Cell phone use has also changed in recent years, McCormick said, which could affect exposure. Whereas studies thus far have mainly looked at the effects of 2G or 3G mobile signals, higher-frequency 5G networks are common today. And people now text as much if not more than they call, so there’s potentially less radiation near the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;The pros and cons of cell phone bans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Despite bipartisan support for cell phone restrictions in schools, plenty of disagreement persists as to precisely what those rules should look like. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Phones can have life-saving benefits — for instance, by allowing children to call 911 — so some parents worry that outright bans could jeopardize their child’s safety. Anderson said policymakers have to weigh those concerns against risks to kids’ mental health and their ability to focus in the classroom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Part of what schools are trying to do is figure out how to wrest back control over what happened in their school climates because of the phone — everything from using the phone to tape fights and incidents that happen in schools to kids using them to make TikToks,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The right approach likely differs from school to school, she added — for instance, in schools where cell phones are the only internet-connected device, a ban may make less sense. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In his interview on Thursday, Kennedy applauded Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who last year issued an executive order directing the state’s education department to &lt;a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/newsroom/news-releases/2024/july/name-1030522-en.html" target="_blank"&gt;draft guidance for public schools to restrict or eliminate phone use&lt;/a&gt; and set aside $500,000 to fund those efforts. Kennedy visited a Virginia high school on Monday that adopted the change, which he said students and teachers there have welcomed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The states that are doing this have found that it is a much healthier environment when kids are not using cell phones in schools,” Kennedy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;However, prior to becoming HHS secretary, Kennedy suggested that although he personally supports getting phones out of schools, parents and teachers should make their own decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“Do we really want the government to decide when, where, and how we communicate?” he &lt;a href="https://x.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1710023376360632465" target="_blank"&gt;wrote on X&lt;/a&gt; in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijgFBVV95cUxQSElwekJlQW93eFBoZDNFNW11c01wZVJkS3VHZVVFeEl1d29jQ25iYWFmTlZnWTZkUEItRmRnazlucUljdTBWclRfZTBHMzFneTNhX2YtN1JLNnBQSDdJMWRqbXN6bWllWlpIZ3NKLS00T3ZERFAtT0lqSXJyMkdNVGFOa21EcjB5cEF2Y1B30gFWQVVfeXFMUGpjLXhJVkFyZWVJckcxWVp1VkY2WGp3OVRVWXhYQVRnSmdSN2tSNWNfV1ZlaWNuYWRPWkpFU3EzUFdwcTRDNG9VVnV6NE1zVHRTaEJQM3c</guid></item><item><title>Allergy sufferers expected to have worse season than usual: See pollen maps - USA TODAY</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxNSEIxVkh4SzRuWncxNlBBd3BieGhGUW5jTVJVbmJJUzlubTlOb0IyTjZXelktVDJlVVI4LVB4OHBKaTA3WWNWLTk1eGYzc1FZZm1FQkd6UjJNMk9CY1V6TTVRa240cl9zNzFkanNqbnplNTctNzhjY3RzSzR2MXR2SVduaURVTExzcWR6RlVuNkZuMTdFWnFsbWZfa28tdERXTEgw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="gnt_ar_b"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;For trees and flowers, early spring might be wonderful, but for allergy sufferers, it can be awful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Springtime has arrived two weeks earlier than usual in several Midwest states this year, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.usanpn.org/data/maps/spring" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;USA National Phenology Network&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Arizona.

The powdery particles drift in the air and are easily inhaled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In some people, inhaling pollen causes their immune systems to overreact. The immune system sees the pollen as a danger and releases antibodies that attack the allergens. This leads to the release of histamines into the blood. Histamines trigger runny noses, itchy eyes and other allergy symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;How pollen affects your body&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;How to help stop the allergy symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Reducing your exposure to pollen allergens and identifying seasonal triggers might help ease your symptoms.

And what’s even in them? Ahead, experts break down how these supps work, and whether you should take them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-do-insulin-resistance-supplements-work" data-node-id="6" class="body-h2 css-1coetfg emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="6.0"&gt;How do insulin resistance supplements work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="7" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;In theory, an insulin resistance supplement would help support insulin sensitivity. “Insulin sensitivity can be looked at as the amount of insulin required to push sugar/carbs into cells to make energy,” explains endocrinologist Rekha Kumar, MD. “More sensitivity means it requires less insulin, and insulin resistance means it takes more insulin to turn carbs to energy.” This balance is vital for keeping healthy blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="9" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;As a result, these supplements are designed to help combat a range of health issues. “Poor insulin sensitivity—insulin resistance—can lead to high blood sugar and lipids, which increases the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a60525665/type-2-diabetes-food-list/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a60525665/type-2-diabetes-food-list/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="type 2 diabetes" data-node-id="9.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and fatty liver disease,” says Christoph Buettner, MD, PhD, chief of the division of endocrinology at Rutgers University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="10" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Insulin resistance supplements are a pretty broad category, so they all work in different ways. Most of them have a range of ingredients that don’t tend to overlap, although there are a few that show up repeatedly:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="11" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="11.0"&gt;Bitter Melon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="12" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;A few small studies suggest that the fruit extract bitter melon may help with lowering blood sugar levels. One randomized controlled trial of 90 people with type 2 diabetes found that levels of HbA1c (which measures average blood sugar levels over two to three months) didn’t change between the bitter melon and placebo groups after 12 weeks, per 2020 research in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965229920302491" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0965229920302491" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Complementary Therapies in Medicine" data-node-id="12.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="12.1.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="12.1.0.0"&gt;Complementary Therapies in Medicine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, the average fasting glucose level of people in the bitter melon group went down during the trial. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="15" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Another small trial on 76 people with prediabetes also found that bitter melon helped to lower glucose levels by suppressing levels of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537082/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537082/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="glucagon" data-node-id="15.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="15.1.0"&gt;glucagon&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a hormone that stimulates the liver to release stores of glucose, according to 2022 research in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10050654/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10050654/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Food Science and Biotechnology" data-node-id="15.3" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="15.3.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="15.3.0.0"&gt;Food Science and Biotechnology&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 data-node-id="16" class="body-h3 css-s6zph9 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="16.0"&gt;White Mulberry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-auya5i emevuu60"&gt;Leaves from this tree are used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat diabetes, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/white-mulberry-leaf" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/white-mulberry-leaf" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="NIH" data-node-id="17.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="17.1.0"&gt;NIH&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

In a 2020 meta-analysis in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32359762/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32359762/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Clinical Nutrition ESPEN" data-node-id="34.0.4" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="34.0.4.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="34.0.4.0.0"&gt;Clinical Nutrition ESPEN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of 37 randomized controlled clinical trials, l-carnitine supplementation significantly decreased body weight, but there were no major effects on waist circumference or body fat percentage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="34.1"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="34.1.0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a44638878/fish-oil-health-benefits/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a44638878/fish-oil-health-benefits/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Omega-3" data-node-id="34.1.0.0" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Omega-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. These healthy fats can reduce inflammation and “may also improve insulin sensitivity and assist with fat loss, especially belly fat,” Malone says. One small 2022 study in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35815739/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35815739/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nutrición Hospitalaria" data-node-id="34.1.2" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;&lt;em data-node-id="34.1.2.0"&gt;&lt;u data-node-id="34.1.2.0.0"&gt;Nutrición Hospitalaria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that omega-3 supplements “augmented” belly fat loss in overweight or obese people who were also on a weight loss diet, but more research is needed to determine whether omega-3 supplementation is effective for weight loss. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-node-id="34.2"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="34.2.0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a40120300/vitamin-d-benefits/" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a40120300/vitamin-d-benefits/" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vitamin D" data-node-id="34.2.0.0" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. “Low vitamin D levels are linked to insulin resistance, so supplementing with vitamin D can help improve sensitivity and potentially support weight loss,” Malone says. There’s a link between taking vitamin D and weight loss, as part of a larger treatment plan like a changed diet, per a 2018 study in &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30246883/"

During walks or runs, it may make you feel heavier, and during strength exercises, it can make the moves feel even tougher to complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many different types of weight vests, as my colleague found out when he &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/i-worked-out-with-a-weight-vest-for-a-week-and-it-kicked-my-ass" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/i-worked-out-with-a-weight-vest-for-a-week-and-it-kicked-my-ass"&gt;exercised with a weight vest for a week&lt;/a&gt; back in 2021. But the idea is simple: secure weights to your front and back and get to work.

For reference, I weigh roughly 57kg (around 125 lbs) and reach 5”2 in height.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this isn’t an enormous amount of weight to add to your daily walk, it made me feel a little sluggish, and I certainly got a sweat on, especially when walking uphill. It definitely made my walk feel more challenging on my legs and core muscles, and I had to focus on bracing my stomach to prevent my lower back from taking the strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took a few more hills than usual and found myself puffing as I strode along with my dog. It’s a simple way to add gentle conditioning to walks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-balance-felt-off"&gt;&lt;span&gt;My balance felt off &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As my colleague also reported, my balance felt slightly off from the change in weight distribution. However, the vest is strapped evenly around the torso rather than isolated to the wrists or ankles, so it doesn't put too much pressure on my joints. I also chose to avoid high-intensity or sudden changes in movement (think burpees), so it didn’t pose too much of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had I opted for rucking — adding weight to a backpack on your back — I believe this would have put more pressure on my back, particularly the upper trapezius muscles that sit along either side of the neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-fitness-tracker-picked-up-on-the-difference"&gt;&lt;span&gt;My fitness tracker picked up on the difference&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m a brisk walker, and with 7kg strapped to my torso, this brought a morning cardio element to my day. I noticed my calorie count was slightly higher, but I don’t check &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/i-just-did-a-500-calorie-hiit-workout-heres-how-many-calories-i-really-burned" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/i-just-did-a-500-calorie-hiit-workout-heres-how-many-calories-i-really-burned"&gt;calorie burn &lt;/a&gt;while I walk, as it can be an unreliable metric to track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have a competitive streak, so &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/i-closed-my-apple-watch-rings-for-an-entire-week-heres-what-i-learned" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/i-closed-my-apple-watch-rings-for-an-entire-week-heres-what-i-learned"&gt;closing my Apple ring&lt;/a&gt;s serves as a daily motivator for me; I tend to look at my overall movement for the day rather than individual workouts and their associated metrics — unless I’m going for a run and want to check my time and splits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cumulative energy expenditure, known as &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/non-exercise-activity-thermogenesis-why-neat-could-help-you-burn-more-calories" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/non-exercise-activity-thermogenesis-why-neat-could-help-you-burn-more-calories"&gt;NEAT&lt;/a&gt; (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis), is a great way to naturally &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/non-exercise-activity-thermogenesis-why-neat-could-help-you-burn-more-calories" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/non-exercise-activity-thermogenesis-why-neat-could-help-you-burn-more-calories"&gt;burn calories &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/boost-your-metabolism-without-dieting-heres-how" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/boost-your-metabolism-without-dieting-heres-how"&gt;boost your metabolism. &lt;/a&gt;Walking with a weight vest just helped to ramp things up a little.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, I noticed my heart rate increase with the intensity of the exercise without resorting to HIIT or running. That’s not to say it increased to the same level it would if I were out jogging, but &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/educ_hess_etds/58/" target="_blank" data-url="https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/educ_hess_etds/58/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;studies &lt;/a&gt;have suggested that a weight vest can boost VO2 max during treadmill walks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you choose to go rucking or walk with a weighted vest, you can combine low-impact resistance training with endurance and improve your daily energy expenditure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-it-still-felt-meditative"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It still felt meditative&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But don’t forget, walking can also benefit your mental health. I recently started making a 5K walk a non-negotiable part of my routine, and I found it helpful for building better mental stamina. Thankfully, I still benefitted even while walking in a weight vest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-one-week-later-is-it-good-to-wear-a-weighted-vest-while-walking"&gt;&lt;span&gt;One week later — Is it good to wear a weighted vest while walking?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What did weighted walking workouts do for me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes much longer than a week to build noticeable differences in strength and fitness metrics, but I could feel my legs and trunk working much harder with the added weight, and I had to focus on core engagement to prevent my back from taking too much of the load. That said, a rucksack would have been even more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I usually use my morning&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/i-took-a-mindful-walk-every-day-for-a-week-here-s-how-it-changed-my-mind-and-body" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/i-took-a-mindful-walk-every-day-for-a-week-here-s-how-it-changed-my-mind-and-body"&gt; 5K walks for mindfulness &lt;/a&gt;(and to exercise my four-year-old pooch), but a week of walking with a weighted vest felt more like a low-impact conditioning workout before starting my day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking has plenty of benefits, aside from increasing your step count and getting you into nature, it can also improve various &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/the-5-components-of-physical-fitness-you-need-to-know" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/the-5-components-of-physical-fitness-you-need-to-know"&gt;components of fitness&lt;/a&gt; like cardiovascular health, which can decrease the risk of chronic conditions like high blood pressure while strengthening your muscles, bones, and joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make bodyweight strength workouts harder or add more intense cardio conditioning to your routine without going high-impact — a weight vest may help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know that walking with weights can also contribute toward bone loading — loading the bones with resistance to help build them up. One&lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1584493&amp;amp;xcust=tomsguide_us_6638888917789054658&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2FBF00435733&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tomsguide.com%2Fwellness%2Ffitness%2Five-been-walking-with-a-weight-vest-for-5k-every-day-heres-what-happened-to-my-body" target="_blank" data-url="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00435733" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed="skimlinks" data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1584493&amp;amp;xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2FBF00435733&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tomsguide.com%2Fwellness%2Ffitness%2Five-been-walking-with-a-weight-vest-for-5k-every-day-heres-what-happened-to-my-body" data-google-interstitial="false" data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - springer.com" data-merchant-network="SkimLinks"&gt; study&lt;/a&gt; even found bone density increased by 1% when exercising in a weighted vest compared with a control group who didn't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'd need to continue testing this out daily for a few weeks to a few months to really notice the physical impacts. However, because wearing a weight vest during walks is low-impact, you can tick the boxes for consistency and frequency without overstraining your muscles and joints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you plan to start walking with weights, increase by a few kgs or lbs every few weeks as you get stronger and fitter, and try to keep your strides even without leaning too far forward as you walk. Think proud chest and strong core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My final verdict? A weighted vest for walks could help you slightly increase overall calorie burn, build strength and endurance, and increase the intensity of workouts, including walks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s simple and affordable, too, but sometimes, I like to walk for pure enjoyment, so I’m not sure this is a challenge I’ll (quite literally) carry into my daily wellness routine going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-more-from-tom-s-guide"&gt;&lt;span&gt;More from Tom’s Guide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

But even if Mr. Slater, 34, finishes a bottle of vodka, he still wakes up feeling fine the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Unless they know me, people don’t really believe me,” Mr. Slater said. “It’s just kind of assumed that when you drink a bunch of poison, your body is going to react.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Daniel Adams, 23, has also never felt queasy or shaky the morning after a night out. One night earlier this month, he drank a six-pack of Budweiser, then a six-pack of Coors Light, then a few shots (he doesn’t remember how many).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The next morning, while his friends groaned, he woke up at 6:30 a.m. and ran four miles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Scientists have a term for people like Mr. Slater and Mr. Adams: “hangover resistant.” And over the last decade and a half, researchers have tried to understand why some people feel weary and wrung-out the day after drinking — and others feel nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It’s tricky to determine just how many people are truly hangover resistant. Much of the research relies on trial participants to describe the agony of their own hangovers, a subjective measure. After all, a headache that feels excruciating to one person might not seem worth mentioning to another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;One of the first studies to show the prevalence of hangover resistance was published in 2008. The researchers happened upon the phenomenon by accident, said Jonathan Howland, a professor emeritus at Boston University School of Medicine and one of the paper’s authors. They had been trying to understand how heavy drinking affected people’s performance at work the next day, only to discover nearly a quarter did not get hungover at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

They excluded studies that did not specify the type of wine and articles like literature reviews and experimental studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They included 22 case-control studies and 20 cohort studies in the final meta-analysis. Researchers did subgroup analyses looking at wine type and cancer type when there were more than three studies regarding the cancer type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also conducted analsyses only including the cohort studies since these have less bias risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirty-seven of the studies looked at site-specific cancer and consumption of red and white wine, while five only looked at red wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When researchers compared the greatest to the lowest wine intake, they did not find an association between wine intake and cancer risk. They also did not observe a difference in how red wine or white wine affected cancer risk.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author &lt;a href="https://vivo.brown.edu/display/ec78" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Eunyoung Cho&lt;/a&gt;, ScD, associate professor of epidemiology and dermatology at Brown School of Public Health, explained the following to &lt;em&gt;Medical News Today&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While it’s well-known that alcohol (including wine) consumption increases the risk of cancer, many people consider red wine to be a healthier option due to its higher levels of antioxidants compared to white wine. However, there have been few large-scale studies directly comparing red wine to white wine in terms of cancer risk, which was why we decided to conduct this meta-analysis. Our findings revealed no significant difference in cancer risk between red and white wine overall. The main message is that there are no safe alcoholic beverages in terms of cancer prevention.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When looking only at cohort studies, researchers observed that white wine was associated with an increased risk for cancer, while red wine still lacked association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There did not appear to be a difference in cancer risk for red versus white wine in men. However, in women, white wine was associated with an increased risk for cancer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, researchers examined the dose-response relationship, including three cohort and 12 case-control studies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers observed that each additional 10 grams of estimated ethanol from red wine, or about one glass, consumed in a day “was associated with a 5% increase in overall cancer risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when only looking at the cohort studies, this association did not persist. Researchers did not observe a significant dose-response relationship for white wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When looking at specific cancers, researchers observed that white wine was associated with an increase in the risk of skin cancer by 22%. Researchers did not observe an association between skin cancer and red wine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skin cancer was the only site-specific cancer that showed a significant difference in associated cancer risk when comparing red wine to white wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red and white wine were associated with an increased risk for female breast cancer, but there was no significant difference in the associated risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, when researchers estimated “what the summary effect size would be if there was no publication bias,” they found a small increase in overall cancer risk for red and white wine, with a possibly higher risk from white wine. However, researchers noted later in the paper that the summary estimates were similar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This meta-analysis has some limitations. The studies were observational, so the findings cannot show a causal relationship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studies used self-reported food frequency questionnaires, and not all the studies used validated food frequency questionnaires. This could have led to misclassification and a minimization of the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers acknowledge recall bias may be more likely to occur in case-control studies than in cohort studies but they also looked at the results examining only the cohort studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors only used two databases to conduct their literature search. They also faced potential limitations from their inclusion and exclusion criteria, the information they chose to extract from each of the included studies, and the methods they chose to use, as well as possible publication bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledge that the observed increase in skin cancer risk in white wine drinkers might be related to different demographic and lifestyle factors between white and red wine drinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the included studies did account for other skin cancer risk factors, so the researchers suggest that the results likely reflect the true effect of white wine on skin cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some cancer sites, they only had a limited number of studies to examine. This meta-analysis also had the biggest sample size related to skin cancer risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers acknowledge that this could have given them enough statistical power to see a difference between red and white wine consumption. This needed amount may have been lacking for the other cancer types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also could only include a certain number of studies in the dose-response analyses, primarily case-control studies. Finally, the authors note, “[p]otential regression dilution bias in the included cohort studies might have also played a role in underestimating summary risk estimates.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hendricks.org/physicians/details.aspx?sid=1&amp;amp;physician=615" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;Brian Black&lt;/a&gt;, DO, an osteopathic physician specializing in family medicine, who was not involved in this work, noted to &lt;em&gt;MNT&lt;/em&gt; that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow css-34gtoi"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Looking at the study as I observe with nonsubstantial overall difference in risk of cancer between the two, it does challenge the stated popular perception that red wine is healthier. I found the limitations of the analysis include its observational design and wine-specific focus, rather than total alcohol intake. That constrains its ability to address broader alcohol-related cancer or health risks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="css-zya54r"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="tabbed-article-section" class="css-1avyp1d"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is room for further exploration in this area of study. More research into site-specific cancers and wine consumption will likely be helpful and more follow-up into the risk of skin cancer from white wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cho noted that it is not entirely clear why they observed this result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“One possibility is that heavy alcohol consumption might be linked to high-risk behaviors, such as sunburn, indoor tanning, or insufficient sunscreen use,” she explained. “But it’s still unclear why white wine appears to be the key factor. Our study suggests that more research is needed to better understand the potential mechanisms behind this.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors note that a component of red wine is resveratrol and that some evidence supports its anticancer properties. Additionally, red wine has higher levels of resveratrol than white wine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this meta-analysis did not show that red wine decreased cancer risk. Researchers acknowledge that this may be due to the rapid metabolism of &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/resveratrol-benefits" class="content-link css-90fpmc"&gt;resveratrol&lt;/a&gt;, leading to low levels of resveratrol in the body after consuming red wine, which might not yield beneficial concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the findings suggest that red wine might not be a better choice compared to white wine when it comes to cancer risk. Cho noted that this “study, which is one of the first of its kind, challenges the belief that red wine is inherently healthier than white wine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Medical News Today</author><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2025 06:17:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMixwFBVV95cUxNNGtSVDRxdTF2Z0duWGJIZGxWWUFhTUtsUlVUT3dVVjhXMkh5ZU1mSnlQNHZMX0NtWi1NOXZuY1VxeHJ6QlBQLVAyTTl3RXZMX2RKS1oxOXZmMW9vQkNHUEs4UUlOOFVHSUJKZzJWaUhNTFhRZmFyWkU5elZpbTFSM19EdlZ6Ul9pV1MyVVVCaVI0bDc5cGRWNFZYdXdmN2xaeEFDLU1oRGNWbExfSTNkZVFnQi1MVHhxSklMQ0d0aHQxd2tUdVow</guid></item><item><title>A longevity scientist who says he's reversed his age by 15 years shares the diet he follows — and 3 foods he avoids - Business Insider</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxPaW0xX0xCSTZRcnhudnZQSUpYR21wUkJuWkRtbWM0cUhUSHktWUw2bnpxMGJ2eDlfQ2haX1RVSVlvc214aGdXTVpza2FLQ0tTZ0hqVEpwTkdmVUMzcEhDaVp3cHhJcHlOLXZBU0pVVE5VRDBMclJJSUFka0F4LXBibUZWMmJxaFlFakVZcjdra1czU1lKcnJhSHNfMkRiUDNPZU9vSW1meEVhemhaVmc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="post-content typography

So you can drink several pieces of fruit in seconds, which you wouldn't be able to do if you ate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we consume sugary foods or beverages, our blood sugar spikes and the pancreas needs to release more insulin to balance it. With repeated spikes, after a period of time the pancreas may not be able to keep up with production needed, which can lead to insulin resistance, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber, which is great for &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/gut-health-boost-overall-digestion-better-moods-2024-7" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;gut health&lt;/a&gt;, also delays the absorption of the sugar therefore &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-eat-carbs-without-blood-sugar-spikes-2024-9" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;preventing blood sugar spikes&lt;/a&gt;, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you eat an orange, the sugar comes in at a much slower rate.

"So I never went back," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He'll still have the odd glass of wine on a special occasion but he rarely drinks these days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2023, the World Health Organization said that "no level of alcohol consumption is safe when it comes to human health," and the US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy published an advisory bringing awareness to&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/alcohol-cancer-risk-surgeon-general-report-smoking-cigarettes-obesity-2025-1" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt; alcohol's links to cancer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advisory said alcohol consumption was the third leading &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-risks-young-people-reduce-diet-alcohol-2024-2" data-analytics-product-module="body_link" rel=""&gt;preventable cause of cancer&lt;/a&gt; in the US, after tobacco and obesity and recommended advocated for warning labels on alcoholic drinks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be honest, this is the first walking workout I’ve ever done from my living room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a fitness editor and a marathon runner, I prioritize getting outside and getting my steps in — I’ve been known to do meetings on the move, with my over-enthusiastic cocker spaniel in tow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet with walking workouts on the rise, I decided to walk 2,000 steps without setting foot outdoors, and surprised myself by how much I loved it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re a fan of Sabrina Carpenter, but didn’t manage to get tickets to her Short n’ Sweet tour, this is a workout worth bookmarking. The 15-minute, low-impact workout is designed by &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@rickbhullarfitness" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/@rickbhullarfitness" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;YouTube trainer Get Fit With Rick&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking me back to my step aerobics days, this workout is more than just walking on the spot. There’s a number of different steps and sequences that Rick takes you through with an infectious enthusiasm, all to the beat of some of Sabrina Carpenter’s most popular songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll walk for 15-minutes in total, and can follow along with Rick in real-time. Unlike other workouts, you can set your &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-adjustable-dumbbells" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-adjustable-dumbbells"&gt;best adjustable dumbbells &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-kettlebells" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-kettlebells"&gt;best kettlebells &lt;/a&gt;to one side, as you won’t need any equipment to complete this one.

When I opt for home workouts it’s normally Pilates or HIIT sessions, not walking, but I pressed play anyway and was immediately marching on the spot. I love the focus during Rick’s workout videos, and found his enthusiasm really uplifting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The different step routines reminded me how uncoordinated I am, but unlike those step aerobics classes I took in my local gym, missing steps didn’t matter in the comfort of my own living room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also found the different step patterns made the time fly. At the end of the 15-minutes, I wished the workout was longer — it really boosted my mood and left me with a smile on my face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-it-was-low-impact-enough-that-i-didn-t-need-shoes"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was low-impact enough that I didn’t need shoes &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I wouldn’t normally recommend doing any form of cardio workout in socks, this workout was low-impact enough for me to leave my running shoes by the front door.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no jumping whatsoever, making this suitable for all levels of fitness. As always, if you’re new to exercise or you’re returning to exercise following an injury or pregnancy, it’s always a good idea to check with a doctor or personal trainer before taking on a new workout routine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-i-walked-further-than-i-thought"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I walked further than I thought &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it’s tricky to say how accurate the step counting was on my Apple Watch, after 15-minutes my watch told me I’d walked 0.84 miles in my living room. My walking pace was a little slower than my normal gait, however I’m not normally side-stepping and ladder-walking along the street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My heart rate stayed in the ‘easy’ zone, but if you’re a beginner, this is a great workout to start adding some movement to your day, plus you can increase the intensity by making this more of a cardio dance workout, should you wish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See you on the dancefloor (I’ll be the one doing the grapevine).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-more-from-tom-s-guide"&gt;&lt;span&gt;More from Tom's Guide &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

(WSMV) - The first measles case of 2025 has been confirmed in the state, and it’s in Middle Tennessee, according to the Tennessee Department of Health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Health officials said the infected person is recovering in their home, while doctors and people worry about the viral infection spreading. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The measles is an infection some people said they weren’t too surprise was spreading, Breanna Thomas said she almost expected it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“I’m going to be honest I wasn’t too shocked because a lot of mothers and fathers are very hesitant to vaccinate their children,” Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Doctor Joseph Gigante with the Monroe Carole Junior Children’s Hospital at Vanderbilt said the spread of measles seemed to be moving fast. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“Unfortunately, the most recent outbreak that started in west Texas has now spread,” Dr. Gigante said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The Tennessee Department of Health announced a measles case was found in Middle Tennessee in March on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“This is where you get really worried and really concerned,” Dr. Gigante said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Tennessee health officials said measles is highly infectious. The virus spreads through the air when an infected person speaks, coughs or sneezes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Officials said the person in Middle Tennessee was infected in early March, but they’re investigating to find out where or how they got the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“It’s a tragedy, but it’s so easy to prevent measles. The best thing parents could do is to vaccinate your child,” Dr. Gigante said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;Doctors said watch out for symptoms of small bumps, high fever, cough and a runny noise. Measles can also be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="w-100"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“There could definitely be a mini epidemic here in Tennessee for sure,” Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;The department reports that there’s an active national measles outbreak with over 300 cases in 11 states, including two deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;“I would hope that the cases are quarantined very well and even put in isolation rooms if they do have to go unfortunately to the hospital,” Thomas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text | article-text"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="copyright |"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Copyright 2025 WSMV.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="article-content-area"&gt;&lt;p id="article-123"&gt;Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, has become quite common lately, claiming lots of lives in the country.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The effects of the disease have been such that even many young people have been forced to drop out of school because they lost their bread winners through hypertension.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But a bigger question is, what is hypertension, and what exactly causes it?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This article provides some insights on hypertension, its causes, and the dangers it poses.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Overview&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Hypertension has become rampant among young people in the country, many of whom are unaware of their status. This has become a major health concern due to the alarming rate at which this group is developing hypertension.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What is hypertension&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is consistently too high. Blood pressure is measured in millimetres of mercury (mmHg) and is expressed as two numbers: systolic pressure (the top number) and diastolic pressure (the bottom number).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Blood pressure ranges&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Normal blood pressure: Less than 120/80mmHg&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Elevated blood pressure: 120-129/80mmHg&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Stage 1 hypertension: 130-139/80-89mmHg&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Stage 2 hypertension: 140 or higher/90 or higher mmHg&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Causes of hypertension and risk factors&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Family history: Having a family history of hypertension increases the risk.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Age: The risk of developing hypertension increases with age.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Obesity: Being overweight or obese is a significant risk factor.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Lifestyle: Lack of physical exercise, smoking, and consuming a diet high in salt, sugar, and saturated fats contribute to hypertension.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Stress: Chronic stress can raise blood pressure.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Kidney diseases: Certain kidney diseases can cause hypertension.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Symptoms&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Hypertension often has no particular symptoms, but some people may experience:&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;
Headaches&lt;br&gt;
Dizziness&lt;br&gt;
Nosebleeds&lt;br&gt;
Shortness of breath&lt;br&gt;
Chest pain&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Complications&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Untreated hypertension can lead to serious health complications, which include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Heart attack&lt;br&gt;
Stroke&lt;br&gt;
Vision loss&lt;br&gt;
Kidney disease&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Diagnosis&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Hypertension is diagnosed using a sphygmomanometer, which measures the pressure in the arteries.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Treatment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Treatment of hypertension usually involves a combination of medication and lifestyle changes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What can be done?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Education and awareness: Raising awareness about hypertension and the dangers it poses can help to regulate it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Regular checkup: Having checked regularly can help to reduce the dangers.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Medication and positive lifestyle: Always take your medication, which helps to remove excess fluid from the body.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Lifestyle Changes: Engage in moderate-intensity physical activity.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Eat a balanced diet focused on whole unprocessed foods.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Stay hydrated by drinking lots of water.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Reduce salt intake.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Manage stress by engaging in stress-reducing activities like yoga.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Conclusion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Regular blood pressure checks and maintaining a healthy lifestyle can help identify and manage hypertension regardless of age.&lt;br&gt;

They went to college together, studied the same major, met their husbands on the same day and got married two months apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You just have this bond unlike any other," Mariela Luster said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But something they didn't share — a cancer diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having her go through something that I couldn't go through, and I couldn't experience was just so hard," Mariela Luster said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Brinlee Luster and her twin sister, Mariela Luster. (Photo: Brinlee Luster)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, at age 21, Brinlee Luster started experiencing puzzling symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was having severe abdominal cramping," she said. "I remember going on a hike and I was just out of breath. I was so fatigued, so tired."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doctors initially attributed her symptoms to irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety or her birth control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just thought, you know, I'm stressed, I'm planning my wedding, I'm about to graduate college, there's a lot of changes," Brinlee Luster said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when her symptoms worsened, she went in for a colonoscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her results turned her life upside down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think anything can prepare you for that moment when you're told you have cancer," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brinlee Luster was diagnosed with stage IV colon cancer and underwent 30 rounds of chemotherapy and several surgeries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a young adult, like right at the brink of where my life was accelerating, I had to slow down and watch everyone else go forward, and that was really hard," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Brinlee Luster receives treatment for her cancer. (Photo: Brinlee Luster)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the American Cancer Society, since 2020, there has been a 9% increase in colon cancer diagnoses in people under 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There really is unfortunately no such thing as too young for colon cancer. About 1 in 7 of the patients in my practice with colon cancer are under the age of 45," said Dr. Mark Lewis, a cancer survivor and director of gastrointestinal oncology at Intermountain Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lewis said this could be due to lifestyle factors, genetics or certain medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Antibiotics in childhood and in adulthood can affect the bacteria that line the colon," he said. "We're being very, very careful about prescribing antibiotics to young people because we do know there is at least a slight increased risk for colon cancer decades later."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptoms of colorectal cancer include abdominal pain, unintentional weight loss, changes in bowel movements like diarrhea, or blood in the stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though it may be uncomfortable, Lewis said bringing up concerns to a provider can make all the difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you are willing to talk to your doctor about your gut health, I promise you we are going to be better at finding colon cancer sooner," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Brinlee Luster is accompanied in the hospital by her sister Mariela Luster.

			&lt;p&gt;As a nurse working in a neurocritical care, I witnessed the sudden and devastating effects of stroke on &lt;a href="https://researchportal.lsbu.ac.uk/en/publications/an-overview-of-traumatic-brain-injury-in-adults-3"&gt;survivors and their carers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following my nursing career, I became a researcher specializing in stroke. Knowledge of &lt;a href="https://groups.stroke.org.uk/what-is-stroke/what-can-i-do-to-reduce-my-risk"&gt;stroke risk factors&lt;/a&gt; in the general public is poor, so stroke prevention is a priority for public health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stroke is &lt;a href="https://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/stroke-tia/background-information/prevalence/"&gt;a leading cause&lt;/a&gt; of death and disability in England – yet it is &lt;a href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673616306791"&gt;largely preventable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's often considered an older person's illness but, although stroke risk does increase with age, it can happen at any time of life. In fact, stroke incidence is &lt;a href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/stroke-in-young-adults-causes"&gt;increasing among adults&lt;/a&gt; below the age of 55 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stroke risk factors that tend to be more common among older people – such as high blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol, obesity,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="155781" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, smoking, physical inactivity and poor diet – are increasingly found in younger people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other lifestyle risks include heavy alcohol consumption or binge drinking and recreational drugs such as amphetamines, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/cocaine-and-alcohol-heres-why-theyre-such-a-deadly-combination-125278"&gt;cocaine&lt;/a&gt; and heroin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some risk factors are not modifiable such as age, sex, ethnicity, family history of stroke, genetics and certain inherited conditions. Women, for example, are &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9911842/"&gt;particularly susceptible to strokes&lt;/a&gt; – and women of all ages are more likely than men to die from a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/STROKEAHA.117.018415"&gt;Stroke risks unique to women&lt;/a&gt; include pregnancy and some contraceptive pills (especially for smokers), as well as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/endometriosis" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73093" data-postid="155781" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;endometriosis&lt;/a&gt;, premature ovarian failure (before 40 years of age), early-onset menopause (before 45 years of age) and estrogen for transgender women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cJBsV93T1Sg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, inherited vascular abnormalities such as &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/around-3-of-us-will-develop-a-brain-aneurysm-in-our-lives-so-what-is-it-and-how-do-you-treat-it-248882"&gt;cerebral aneurysms&lt;/a&gt; – a weakness in the artery wall – can increase the risk of &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559173/"&gt;hemorrhagic stroke&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some risk factors are social rather than biological, however. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09580-x"&gt;Studies have found&lt;/a&gt; that people with a lower income and education level are at a higher risk of having a stroke. This is due to a combination of factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unhealthy lifestyle habits, such as smoking, heavier drinking and lower physical activity levels &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75822-y"&gt;are more common&lt;/a&gt; in people with lower incomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(15)00200-8/abstract"&gt;research also shows&lt;/a&gt; that people with lower socioeconomic status are less likely to receive good quality healthcare than people with higher incomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, regardless of biological or social risk factors, there are things you can do – right now – to reduce your risk of having a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Essential eight&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Stop smoking&lt;/strong&gt; Smokers are &lt;a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/smoking-and-cardiovascular-disease"&gt;more than twice as likely&lt;/a&gt; to have a stroke than non-smokers. Smoking causes damage to blood vessel walls, increases blood pressure and heart rate but reduces oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smoking also causes &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/diseases/heart-disease-stroke.html"&gt;blood to become sticky&lt;/a&gt;, further increasing the risk of blood clots that can block blood vessels and cause a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Keep blood pressure in check&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9441708/"&gt;High blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; damages the walls of blood vessels, making them weaker and more prone to rupture or blockage. It can also cause blood clots to form, which can then travel to the brain and block blood flow, leading to a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're over 18 years of age, get your blood pressure checked regularly so, if you do show signs of developing high blood pressure, you can nip it in the bud and make appropriate changes to your lifestyle to help reduce your risk of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Keep an eye on your cholesterol&lt;/strong&gt; According to the &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org.uk/stroke/managing-risk/high-cholesterol"&gt;UK Stroke Association&lt;/a&gt; your risk of a stroke is nearly three and a half times higher if you have both high cholesterol and high blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To lower cholesterol, aim to keep saturated fat – found in fatty meats, butter, cheese, and full-fat dairy – below 7 percent of your daily calories, stay active and maintain a healthy weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Watch your blood sugar&lt;/strong&gt; High blood glucose levels &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261561420306002"&gt;are linked&lt;/a&gt; to an increased risk of stroke. This is because &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/sugar-its-not-just-the-calories-that-are-bad-for-you-56459"&gt;high blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; damages blood vessels, which can lead to blood clots that travel to the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reduce blood glucose levels, try to take regular exercise, eat a balanced diet rich in fiber, drink enough water, maintain a healthy weight, and try &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/how-to-remain-youthful-and-resilient-despite-stress-173173"&gt;to manage stress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Maintain a healthy weight&lt;/strong&gt; Being overweight is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/stroke/causes"&gt;main risk factors&lt;/a&gt; for stroke. It is associated with almost one in five strokes, and &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20299666/"&gt;increases your stroke risk by 22 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being obese raises that risk by 64 percent. &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/weight-management/adult-overweight-obesity/health-risks#stroke"&gt;Carrying too much weight&lt;/a&gt; increases your risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, high cholesterol and type 2 diabetes, which all contribute to higher stroke risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Follow a Mediterranean diet&lt;/strong&gt; One way to eat a fiber-rich balanced diet and maintain a healthy weight is to follow a &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/both-statins-and-a-mediterranean-style-diet-can-help-ward-off-heart-disease-and-stroke-64609"&gt;Mediterranean diet&lt;/a&gt;. This has been shown to &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-019-00504-7"&gt;reduce the risk of stroke&lt;/a&gt;, especially when supplemented with nuts and olive oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9 youtube-iframe relative"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xjPl7K5vh_M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Sleep well&lt;/strong&gt; Try to to get seven to nine hours of sleep daily. Too little sleep &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/health-check-three-reasons-why-sleep-is-important-for-your-health-41176"&gt;can lead to high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most important modifiable risk factors for stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too much sleep, however, is also &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1389945721005505?via%3Dihub"&gt;associated with increased stroke risk&lt;/a&gt;, so try to stay as active as possible so you can sleep as well as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Stay active&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/"&gt;NHS recommends &lt;/a&gt; that people should avoid prolonged sedentary behavior and aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity activity or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity activity a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exercise should be spread evenly over four to five days a week, or every day. Do strengthening activities, usually more than two days per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that while the effects of stroke can be devastating and life-changing, it is largely preventable. Adopting these eight simple lifestyle changes can help to reduce stroke risk and optimize both heart and brain health.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/251524/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;
