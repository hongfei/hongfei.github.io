                A blood test called a PSA can help screen men for prostate cancer but it can also lead to unnecessary treatment.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;News that former President Joseph Biden has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/18/g-s1-67544/joe-biden-prostate-cancer" target="_blank"&gt;advanced prostate cancer&lt;/a&gt; has revived long-standing questions about the benefits versus the harms of a blood test that screens for the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11774093/" target="_blank"&gt;most commonly diagnosed cancer among men&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/prostate/psa-fact-sheet" target="_blank"&gt;Prostate-specific antigen&lt;/a&gt;, or PSA, screening tests are an imperfect tool for detecting prostate cancer, doctors and public health experts say.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Part of the problem is identifying and treating aggressive cancers like Biden's while not unnecessarily treating men with slow-growing cancers unlikely to sicken them. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4485977/" target="_blank"&gt;Autopsies found&lt;/a&gt; the disease to be so widespread that more than one-third of white men and half of Black men in their 70s had prostate cancers that would never do any harm.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"PSA testing alone leaves a lot to be desired as a cancer screening test," said radiation oncologist Dr. Brent Rose, an associate professor at the University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The test measures the level of PSA, a protein produced by normal as well as malignant prostate gland cells, in the blood. Elevated PSA can be a marker for cancer. It also can signal a false positive or an inactive cancer, triggering a painful biopsy, and leading to overtreatment with punishing side effects, including impotence, incontinence and bowel dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"PSA screening is beneficial," Rose said. "There are risks, though, and so it is a personal decision whether or not to do PSA screening."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The key is to target and treat aggressive cancers while waiting and watching cancers that might never become troublesome, Rose and other oncologists told NPR. Physicians have been walking this tightrope since they began regularly using PSA tests to screen for prostate cancer in healthy men in the 1990s. There is no other test that effectively screens for prostate cancer — the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/prostate-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" target="_blank"&gt;second deadliest cancer&lt;/a&gt; for American men, oncologists said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A history of conflicting guidance&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Attempts to balance the possible harms against the number of lives saved have led to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11774093/" target="_blank"&gt;two decades of fluctuating&lt;/a&gt; – and confusing – public health guidelines on PSA screening. In 2012, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force advised against any screening, only to issue a watered-down recommendation in 2018 that men ages 55 to 69 discuss screening with their health care providers. Various physicians' groups offer conflicting guidance for this age group.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In its advice to older men, however, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has been somewhat more consistent. In 2008, the independent panel of national experts recommended men 75 and older not be screened, and since 2018, the panel has advised against screening men 70 and older.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Biden, 82, apparently followed the guidance. He last had a PSA screening test in 2014, when he was 71 or 72 years old, a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/19/nx-s1-5403887/trump-biden-cancer" target="_blank"&gt;spokesman said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For men between the ages of 55 and 69, the task force &lt;a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/recommendation/prostate-cancer-screening" target="_blank"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; talking to their health care providers about their preferences before deciding whether to get a PSA test. It classifies the recommendation as Grade C, which means it offers only a small benefit and insurers may not cover it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Finding the time to have a conversation about a topic as complicated as the value of prostate-cancer screening can be challenging for most primary-care physicians, oncologists interviewed for this story said. And while some men might welcome what's called "shared decision-making," others find it agonizing. Still, the only advice for men for now is to talk the issue over carefully with their doctors.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;The case for the PSA test&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Alicia Morgans, a genitourinary medical oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, recognizes the problem and hopes that the task force will address it in new guidelines, which it is currently drafting. In August, she met with the volunteer panel in her role as chair of the medical advisory board for the advocacy group Zero Prostate Cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Morgans believes the current guidance was based on a flawed clinical trial. It concluded that men screened with PSA tests were no less likely to die of prostate cancer than men assigned to a group that was not screened. But the results were muddied because nearly 90% of the men in the control group had at least one PSA test before or during the trial, she said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Morgans would like to see the recommendation beefed up so more men get screened for prostate cancer and Black men and men with a family history, who are more vulnerable get screened earlier.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I take care of people who have very advanced prostate cancer, as well as some people who have curable prostate cancer," she said, "so my perspective is really skewed by the fact that I really want to make that diagnosis when things are curable."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;So does Dr. Matthew Cooperberg, a urologic oncologist and a professor at the University of California, San Francisco. He has pushed to rename early-stage prostate cancer in part to ease the stress of a cancer diagnosis. One possible name, "&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39350309/" target="_blank"&gt;acinar neoplasm&lt;/a&gt;," describes an abnormal growth but one lacking the potential to spread or kill. Cooperberg also advocates monitoring men with elevated PSAs before rushing to biopsy their prostates.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Men should get PSA testing in midlife with the goal of finding aggressive prostate cancer," he said. "If we find low-grade disease along the way, whether or not we call it cancer, we should not treat it. We just monitor it with active surveillance. If we do that, we can erase this cancer."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h3 class="edTag"&gt;A new approach to prostate cancer screening emerges&lt;/h3&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Dr. Tyler Seibert, a radiation oncologist and associate professor at the University of California, San Diego, is not as optimistic about eliminating prostate cancer. But he too is dedicated to finding ways to identify the bad prostate cancers and treating only them.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;When doctors first began doing PSA screening tests, he said, "there was a flawed assumption that was implicit that if you find any kind of prostate cancer, you must treat that kind of prostate cancer aggressively," he said. "Many of them would never have harmed the patient."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A new era in prostate-cancer screening has arrived, Seibert believes. Today, instead of men immediately having their prostates biopsied when they get an elevated PSA test, he and an increasing number of prostate-cancer specialists recommend first getting an MRI and, when possible, watching and waiting.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"For these patients with low-risk prostate cancer, we have really strong evidence that we can follow them closely, and they basically can just carry on with their life," he said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Not everyone is comfortable with getting periodic blood tests to see if their PSA might be rising and they might indeed need cancer treatment, Seibert acknowledged. But most of his patients do become comfortable with the protocol, he said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Every time you get that blood test, you're kind of a little bit nervous," he said. "If you can tolerate that, and you don't think that it's going to be causing you too much anxiety, then screening makes a lot of sense."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ronnie Cohen is freelance health journalist based in the San Francisco Bay Area.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The study also found that cereals’ protein and fiber content — nutrients essential for a healthy diet — have been in decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The findings, based on an analysis of 1,200 new or reformulated cereal products introduced in the United States between 2010 and 2023, are likely to add fuel to the ongoing debate about the relationship between processed food, mounting childhood obesity and the rising prevalence of chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The debate has gained greater prominence in the months since health secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. began using the federal bully pulpit to excoriate ultra-processed foods as part of his “&lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.maha.vote/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Make America Healthy Again&lt;/a&gt;” campaign. Mr. Kennedy, who has declared that “sugar is poison,” last month &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/well/food-dyes-ban.html" title=""&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that the Department of Health and Human Services would work to remove some artificial dyes from the U.S. food supply, citing concerns about their impact on children’s health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Shuoli Zhao, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of Kentucky and a co-author of the new study, said the findings were especially notable given evolving consumer awareness about the links between excess consumption of sugar, salt and saturated fat and chronic conditions like diabetes, hypertension and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“What’s most surprising to me is that the healthy claims made on the front of these products and the nutritional facts on the back are actually going in the opposite direction,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The analysis, based on data gathered by the marketing consultancy Mintel, did not identify brand names, nor did it capture information on purchasing and consumption habits. The vast majority of the 1,200 products it analyzed were relaunches of existing cereals, including so-called reformulations that alter a product’s taste or nutritional content, Professor Zhao said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;A new blood test that detects a hallmark of Alzheimer's is poised to change the way doctors diagnose and treat the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The test, the first of its kind to be &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-blood-test-used-diagnosing-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank"&gt;cleared&lt;/a&gt; by the Food and Drug Administration, is for people 55 and older who already have memory problems or other signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The results show whether the brain of a person with cognitive symptoms also has amyloid plaques, clumps of toxic proteins that build up in the spaces between brain cells. The presence of plaques in a person with cognitive symptoms usually confirms an Alzheimer's diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;   
   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"I think the blood test is going to really revolutionize the way people with Alzheimer's are cared for and diagnosed," says &lt;a href="https://www.alzdiscovery.org/about-addf/people/howard-fillit" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Howard Fillit&lt;/a&gt;, chief science officer at the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Primary care physicians will now have access to something that can give them a quicker read" on whether a patient has Alzheimer's, says &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.alz.org/press/spokespeople/maria_c_carrillo_ph_d__;!!Iwwt!VrdWEd07buTn9e3_1U59sDhdIjoDbFFDZXMHo1heaKWdign1BJrnWydkO67oLWq1w8L5yJM874hC$" target="_blank"&gt;Maria Carrillo&lt;/a&gt;, chief science officer of the Alzheimer's Association.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;One benefit of a readily-available blood test will be more accurate diagnoses, Fillit says, noting that currently, primary care doctors correctly diagnose patients only about 60% of the time.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Specialty neurologists get it right like seventy, eighty percent of the time," He says. "With the blood test, we can get it up to over 90%."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/63/Supplement_1/13S" target="_blank"&gt;PET scan&lt;/a&gt; is the gold standard for detecting the amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer's. But the technology is costly, and unavailable in many communities.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another option is to test fluid from a spinal tap, an invasive procedure that most doctors and patients tend to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;There are already&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/08/02/g-s1-14852/alzheimers-new-blood-tests-amyloid-tau-ptau217-diagnosis" target="_blank"&gt; lab-developed blood tests&lt;/a&gt; that can signal the presence of amyloid. But the Lumipulse assay, made by the diagnostic company Fujirebio, is the first to receive marketing clearance from the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Having such a test is likely to mean that many more people will be diagnosed when their symptoms are still mild, and potentially treatable.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/30/g-s1-63345/alzheimers-survey-americans-testing-treatment-risky" target="_blank"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; from the Alzheimer's Association found that the vast majority of older Americans would take a blood test to find out if they have the disease.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People who are diagnosed while still in the early stages of Alzheimer's may be eligible to receive one of the two &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/27/nx-s1-5309499/alzheimers-was-taking-her-memory-so-she-started-taking-a-new-drug" target="_blank"&gt;amyloid-reducing drugs&lt;/a&gt; now on market.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lab-developed blood tests have been used primarily by researchers, or by specialists in large medical centers. The test cleared by the FDA is likely to attract a much broader audience.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's been through rigorous evaluation, and it provides guidance for prescribers on who's eligible and when the test should be provided," Carrillo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The result should be more testing of people in rural or underserved areas.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Blood tests have given us an opportunity to really democratize this kind of testing," Carrillo says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It also means that many more of the estimated &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/getmedia/ef8f48f9-ad36-48ea-87f9-b74034635c1e/alzheimers-facts-and-figures.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;7.2 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; thought to be living with Alzheimer's are likely to get a formal diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To help health health care providers counsel these individuals, the Alzheimer's Association is writing guidelines on how to speak to patients about the results of a blood test, what it means to live with the disease, and what the treatment options are.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The guidelines are expected this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

The immune system goes into overdrive and starts attacking healthy tissues and organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can cause a fever, rashes and inflammation in crucial organs such as the liver, lungs and kidneys. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Minocycline is&lt;span&gt; prescribed to around 1million Americans every year for &lt;/span&gt;various bacterial infections including pneumonia and in some cases, acne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While facial acne is usually a result of hormonal imbalances and clogged pores, it can also be caused by bacteria on the skin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In Dunn's case, doctors struggled to pinpoint the cause of her deteriorating condition as her body continued to swell up and develop rashes for weeks at end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She recalled in a TikTok video: 'Every single one of [my] organs was shutting down and [doctors] told my parents that [I] was actually going to die.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As doctors scrambled to find out what was happening to Dunn, the then-teenager stopped breathing for about 30 minutes due to the severity of her condition and had to be put on assisted breathing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She told &lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://people.com/teen-takes-acne-medication-briefly-dies-from-rare-drug-reaction-exclusive-11704952"&gt;PEOPLE&lt;/a&gt;: 'I remember just feeling like my body was shutting down. I had no idea what was happening to me, and neither did the doctors at first.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However two weeks later, doctors misdiagnosed her with Parvovirus - a contagious virus mainly affecting children that can cause facial rashes and a fever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;DReSS symptoms can cause an outbreak of measles-like rashes all over the body. (Stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But she continued to remain in immense pain as her symptoms worsened over the next two months and had to return back to the hospital. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Eventually, a medical student realized that she was suffering from DReSS syndrome after they had spent a week learning about the disorder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;DReSS syndrome is most commonly triggered by antibiotics and can be caused by any form of the anti-bacterial drug. &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Its symptoms can cause an outbreak of measles-like rashes all over the body, high fever, increase in white blood cells in the blood, swelling in the lymph nodes and injuries to internal organs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The exact mechanisms of how the syndrome is triggered remains unknown but experts believe it is usually due to a combination of genetic factors and the immune system's response to certain drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists estimate that one in 10,000 suffer from the condition - out of which one in 10 die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The syndrome is usually treated with a combination of topical steroid treatments and anti-inflammatory medication.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In Dunn's case, as doctors scrambled to find out what was happening to her, the then-teenager stopped breathing for about 30 minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After her diagnosis, Dunn told the magazine: 'When they finally told me it was DReSS syndrome, I had never heard of it before. I had no idea an antibiotic for acne could do this to me.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Due to the severity of her condition, she was asked to use steroid treatments for weeks to suppress her immune system and stop the spread of the rashes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dunn now claims that she has since learned to be extremely cautious with medication and does not take any medication without checking with experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Furthermore, she has also begun efforts to raise awareness about the syndrome and said: 'If my story can help even one person recognize signs early and get the right diagnosis, then it's worth sharing .'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 17:50:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>眼部检查可以区分帕金森氏症和继发性帕金森氏症-《今日帕金森新闻》 | Eye test can distinguish Parkinson’s from secondary parkinsonism - Parkinson's News Today</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilwFBVV95cUxNQ3hLdllxdDBLcWVucm9qeVk4QlNjUGdhTUZ2aUhuSkFjVW5KUWdKNWJPbjQ3NHh1RVhCUm9mb1pYckJJYnFsMDFSb1lCN2JzdDJla1RRU1NVT2ZINDFPa1ZmNi1RbVRRZUNfUUxBR3Y4MGxjSTRCbUJCUUp2MmtDRG9mVTllRVROYkFyWkRZMTFMRkF6NFFZ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="pf-content"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imaging of nerves in the eyes may be used to differentiate between &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-is-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/a&gt; and secondary forms of parkinsonism, a new study shows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41531-025-00969-2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Corneal confocal microscopy differentiates patients with secondary parkinsonism from idiopathic Parkinson’s disease&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” was published in &lt;em&gt;NPJ Parkinson’s Disease&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3&gt;Parkinson’s can cause abnormalities in nerves connecting eyes and brain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/what-causes-parkinsons-disease/"&gt;caused by the dysfunction&lt;/a&gt; and death of brain cells that are responsible for making the chemical messenger dopamine. Parkinson’s is marked by &lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/parkinsons-disease-symptoms/motor/"&gt;motor symptoms&lt;/a&gt; such as slowed movement, tremor, stiffness, and balance issues. Most people with Parkinson’s have idiopathic disease, meaning the underlying cause is not known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/types-of-parkinsons-disease/#Secondary"&gt;Secondary parkinsonism&lt;/a&gt; refers to health conditions that can cause Parkinson’s-like motor symptoms, but are not actually Parkinson’s disease. Secondary parkinsonism can develop due to drugs or toxins, or because of problems with blood flow or fluid pressure in and around the brain. Since secondary parkinsonism is by definition characterized by symptoms that are similar to Parkinson’s disease, it can be difficult for clinicians to tell the two apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease can cause abnormalities in the nerves that connect the eyes to the brain, which are generally less affected in secondary parkinsonism. These nerves can be visualized using a technique called corneal confocal microscopy, or CCM. In this study, scientists in China tested whether CCM might be used to reliably distinguish between true Parkinson’s disease and secondary parkinsonism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="bio-blockquote bio-blockquote--align-left"&gt;
  &lt;p class="bio-blockquote-text"&gt;CCM may have clinical utility as a rapid ophthalmic neuroimaging method for distinguishing patients with [secondary parkinsonism] from [Parkinson’s disease].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study included 45 people with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease and 25 with secondary parkinsonism. The researchers found patients with Parkinson’s had a lower density of nerve fibers detected by CCM than those with secondary parkinsonism. They also tended to have more branch-like protrusions on their nerves than those with secondary parkinsonism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test if these CCM-based measures could distinguish between the two conditions, the researchers calculated a statistical value called the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). This is a statistical test of how well a measure (in this case, CCM) can distinguish between two groups, Parkinson’s or secondary parkinsonism in this study. AUC values can range from 0.5 to 1, with higher numbers reflecting better accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The AUC for CCM in this study was 0.924, suggesting high accuracy for distinguishing true Parkinson’s from secondary parkinsonism. The researchers noted they could get even better accuracy if they also included clinical measures like assessments of symptom severity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“CCM may have clinical utility as a rapid ophthalmic neuroimaging method for distinguishing patients with [secondary parkinsonism] from [Parkinson’s disease],” the scientists concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

Using validated mental health screening tools, researchers found that 1 in 4 children had new anxiety symptoms and 1 in 7 had new depressive symptoms, despite no prior mental health history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These children reported a quality of life comparable to peers with serious illnesses like cancer or cystic fibrosis, with many expressing a deep sense of ineffectiveness and loss of confidence. The findings underscore the urgent need for integrated mental health screening and early intervention in pediatric long COVID care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Onset:&lt;/strong&gt; Nearly 40% of children with long COVID reported anxiety or depression; half had no prior diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality of Life:&lt;/strong&gt; Mental health impact was comparable to that of serious chronic illnesses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; A child’s sense of ineffectiveness was the strongest predictor of poor life quality.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Kennedy Krieger Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study from Kennedy Krieger Institute is calling attention to an emerging mental health crisis among children with long COVID. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that nearly 40% of pediatric patients with long COVID reported feeling significant symptoms of anxiety or depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 139 patients evaluated at Kennedy Krieger’s Pediatric Post-COVID-19 Rehabilitation Clinic. Clinicians used mental health screening surveys to assess symptoms reported by the patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The screenings also included measures of key aspects of quality of life including: physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, and school functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 1 in 3 children reported that they were experiencing elevated symptoms of anxiety or depression (i.e. worry, sleep problems, and mood irritability).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dr. Laura Malone, director of the clinic and co-investigator in this research, says half of these children had no prior mental health concerns or diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Long COVID is a complex condition,” said Malone. “We’re seeing children and teens who were doing well before their COVID infection now struggling to attend school, socialize, or even enjoy basic activities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key findings include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 in 4&lt;/strong&gt; children had new anxiety symptoms, and &lt;strong&gt;1 in 7&lt;/strong&gt; had new depressive symptoms, despite &lt;em&gt;no prior diagnosis&lt;/em&gt;—a sign long COVID is triggering new mental health challenges.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On average, children reported a quality of life similar to peers with&lt;strong&gt; cancer or cystic fibrosis&lt;/strong&gt;, underscoring the severe functional impact of the condition.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The strongest predictor of poor quality of life was&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a &lt;strong&gt;“sense of ineffectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;,” like feeling unable to succeed in life or enjoy activities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These children are losing confidence in themselves and their ability to participate in daily life,” said Dr. Malone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That loss of function can be just as devastating as the physical symptoms. It is important to identify and treat both to improve quality of life for children with long COVID.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While previous studies have hinted at long COVID’s mental health toll, this is one of the first to use standardized, validated measures of mental health issues in a pediatric long COVID population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also warns that traditional screening tools may not capture the full picture, since physical symptoms of long COVID (like fatigue or dizziness) can overlap with those of anxiety or depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Kennedy Krieger urge healthcare providers to integrate routine mental health screening into care for children with long COVID. Early identification could mean faster access to the right interventions, therefore helping kids recover more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this long COVID and mental health research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d592b9b0b4a6babb81b4959eb0bbbbb0b1ac9ea7bcb0b2b0a7fbbaa7b2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Taylor Gleason&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://KennedyKrieger.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kennedy Krieger Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Taylor Gleason – Kennedy Krieger Institute&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;Journal of Psychology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 16:28:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTFBkNnpUN0llRFRrZFp1by1KdXViOVp5R2sxNjBGNnlrVUkxTEtkTy01QnMwNXd1TnYxYVpUR1U4dkZMSC1SNnBWcW43aGM2RFJzLXE4aWdXUnplTlczQzA3TmNvMlZvUGdKX21WMDlCbzNacnVH</guid></item><item><title>专家说，昂贵的阿尔茨海默氏症生活方式计划提供了虚假的希望-纽约时报 | An Expensive Alzheimer’s Lifestyle Plan Offers False Hope, Experts Say - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxNZ2ItcVVyblNKbEtyWUxFcGViNnE1RzFaWTNMdjh4UjZ2NUVwc3dYdk9QNFJaU1ZlWXdHYWE3bzhxLWlmeW9HV19KdUZsbzlCc1ZhY0RrTThuLW1PQ3FmTnVPUnZuWWxBbEJjUXEwOWpUUTlMTFN5aUVmOGNYa2FhYzUxaXBheFpOZUNNNXlHNA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Kerry Briggs had trouble keeping track of the supplements. To help, her husband, John Briggs, created a spreadsheet with rows for ashwagandha, Omega-3 and curcumin extract. There was ginseng, lion’s mane mushroom and the antioxidant liposomal glutathione, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Ms. Briggs, 64, had started taking the supplements last July, a daily regimen that grew to include 34 capsules and tablets along with two scoops of powder. When it became too much, Mr. Briggs began blending them into a shake, to which he added brown food coloring so it looked less like its natural “sickly” olive shade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Ms. Briggs was taking them all because a doctor had told her that with enough supplements and lifestyle modifications, her Alzheimer’s symptoms could not only be slowed, but reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;It is an idea that has become the focus of &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/title-2538046" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;television specials&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://youtu.be/UyneMnERmnI?si=5JHTmPvmph-Qim_0&amp;amp;t=8760" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;popular podcasts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://drtalks.com/summit/reverse-alzheimers/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;conferences&lt;/a&gt;; the sell behind mushroom supplements and self-help books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;But the suggestion that Alzheimer’s can be reversed through lifestyle adjustments has outraged doctors and scientists in the medical establishment, who have repeatedly said that there is little to no proof for such a claim, and expressed concern that the idea could harm a large group of vulnerable Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Mr. Briggs had come across the idea after learning about Dale Bredesen, who had been performing a series of small and unconventional studies through which he claimed to have designed a set of guidelines to reverse Alzheimer’s symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

              &lt;p&gt;A family vacation to Costa Rica turned sour after 12 of 13 relatives developed symptoms of a fungal lung infection following an excursion through bat-filled caves.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In season two of &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt;, the cordyceps fungus—spoiler alert—becomes airborne, meaning the fungal infection can spread not just through bites but also when humans inhale its spores. While the TV show is highly fictitious, airborne fungi are most certainly not. A U.S. family now knows this better than most, since 12 of their members became ill after touring a bat cave in Costa Rica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7417a1.htm"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; published Thursday in the journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, researchers described 12 confirmed or probable cases of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24811-histoplasmosis"&gt;histoplasmosis&lt;/a&gt;: a pulmonary infection caused by inhaling the fungus &lt;em&gt;Histoplasma capsulatum&lt;/em&gt;. This fungus lives in soil, frequently alongside bird or bat droppings, and can become airborne if the earth is disturbed. While symptoms are usually subtle, the infection can make infants and immunocompromised people vulnerable to more serious illnesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During a vacation to Costa Rica in December of last year, 12 of 13 family members toured the bat-colonized Venado Caves, an ancient cave system and popular tourist destination. This essentially meant crawling through bat poop for two hours. When they returned to the U.S., everyone—except the one family member who hadn’t toured the cave—became ill to varying degrees, with symptoms including fever, headache, muscle pain, night sweats, respiratory problems, and gastrointestinal issues.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Five family members sought medical attention. Doctors tested four of them for fungal infections, and two tested positive for histoplasma. Two of the patients also had abnormal chest X-rays, one of which raised concern for possible lung cancer. After learning about their spelunking expedition, healthcare providers notified the CDC, which launched an investigation. Notably, the cave they had visited had also likely caused a histoplasmosis outbreak in 1998 and 1999.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Antigen testing for all four patients occurred within 1 month of symptom onset, the optimal time frame,” the team, led by CDC researchers, wrote in the report. “However, because antigen detection sensitivity for histoplasmosis is lower in patients with mild disease who are immunocompetent, the negative test results might have been false negatives.” In other words, given that it’s harder to detect histoplasmosis in healthy patients, the family members who tested negative might still have had histoplasmosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ultimately, doctors confirmed that one family member had histoplasmosis, eight members probably did, and three were suspected of having it. Fortunately, none of them became zombies—or had lung cancer—and within 28 days of exposure, they were all on their way to recovery. While doctors usually prescribe antifungal medication for patients with severe histoplasmosis, many cases in healthy individuals &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/histoplasmosis/treatment#:~:text=Most%20cases%20of%20histoplasmosis%20go,infection%20and%20your%20immune%20status."&gt;go away&lt;/a&gt; on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Histoplasmosis is sometimes difficult to diagnose. As such, the researchers urge clinicians to “consider fungal illness in the differential diagnosis of patients with constitutional or pulmonary signs or symptoms after recent caving or other activities associated with risk for histoplasmosis,” they concluded. In collaboration with the U.S. Embassy in Costa Rica and the Costa Rica Ministry of Health, the CDC hopes to see the risk of histoplasmosis included in the Venado Caves tour waiver forms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s not surprising that &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt; is so popular. After all, Andrzej Sapkowski—author of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;—&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8205437-there-s-a-grain-of-truth-in-every-fairy-tale-love"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; that “there’s a grain of truth in every fairy tale.” That seems to hold true, even in a fungal zombie apocalypse.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0hzfd000o3b77gnanjc6t@published"&gt;I am a gay man, and discovered a Fleshlight in my husband’s underwear drawer while I was putting some of his clothes away a few days ago. When I confronted him about it, he said a (female) friend of his gave it to him as a joke for April Fool’s Day, and he just wanted to “try it out.” We have an active and fulfilling sex life (or at least I thought). Do I have reason to be concerned that I may not be enough for him, or worse, that he may have needs I can’t satisfy?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0hzjr000r3b778dpii073@published"&gt;The implications of your question trouble me. Do you think your husband is not entitled to self-pleasure? Would you be similarly offended to learn that he uses his … &lt;em&gt;hand&lt;/em&gt; to masturbate? How much control over his sexuality do you think you’re entitled to? You’re gay, so surely you’re aware of the widespread practice of open relationships within your tribe, right? Plenty of relationships survive not only their constituent partners masturbating, but partners having sex with other people, sometimes in large group settings. That’s enough to make a Fleshlight look about as threatening to a relationship as a flashlight.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="129" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0hzl4000s3b770qtsoeww@published"&gt;People seek pleasure from sources other than their primary partner for a number of reasons. Yeah, it may have something to do with dissatisfaction, but it just as easily might not. If you are indeed in a monogamous relationship, and I assume so given your reaction to your husband having sex with an inanimate object, maybe all he wants is some variety. People like novelty, and masturbating, even with a toy, is a way to experience it. You are better off going with your gut and what your husband tells you. If you think your sex life is active and fulfilling, it probably is. Unless you are oblivious to signs, you would know if there were an issue. Your husband likely has a healthy libido and an adventurous mind.&lt;/p&gt;

It seems that you do satisfy plenty already. No one can be everything. In the future, instead of confronting your husband over something that intimidates you sexually, you should express curiosity. What does he like about that object and why? Is there anything he’d like to try that the two of you aren’t doing? If you went as far as to ask him to incorporate the Fleshlight in your sex life, you’d be showing him the kind of acceptance that will likely make him comfortable communicating about such things. That could take the mystery out of the situation and make it so you don’t have to wonder if you should be concerned or whether you’re fulfilling his needs.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="95" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0i94f001m3b772i8m3ihc@published"&gt;Mike’s birthday was nearly a month ago, and Rachel and I decided the threesome would be the perfect surprise. The trouble was, when the moment came, Mike COULD NOT get it up, which is completely unusual for him. No matter what we tried, he remained a limp noodle. Needless to say, everyone ended up sorely disappointed. But that isn’t the worst of it. Ever since then, my husband hasn’t been able to achieve an erection. I’ve suggested going to see a urologist, but Mike is so embarrassed and depressed that he refuses. Now I’m scared we’ll never have sex again! Help!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="182" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0i94f001p3b778aixvx8n@published"&gt;Maybe you start by letting Mike know that what he experienced is not uncommon at all. For as much as he wanted the threesome, and as much pleasure as it seemed to promise, years of fantasizing were leading up to that moment. That alone can make for a pressurized situation that promotes performance anxiety. Possibly compounding the situation was that you sprung it on him. You and Rachel had the best intentions for doing so and reason to assume that it would go in a mutually satisfying direction, but it didn’t. Anxiety, period, is a huge boner killer, and one can get stuck in a cycle of worrying about not getting hard, not being hard, and then worrying more about how it’s coming across. It can be difficult to break that cycle, no matter how hot the situation or even how affirming one’s partners are. It certainly helps when the partner(s) don’t buy into the anxiety or pressure, but there’s no guarantee that shrugging it off will actually help. Expressions of “sore” disappointment, though, almost certainly make an already fraught situation worse.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="257" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0i94h001q3b77n5l4r5nu@published"&gt;Erectile dysfunction drugs, in addition to opening up vessels and getting the blood flowing, can work as anti-anxiety meds. Knowing you have a little bit of extra lift can abate some of that nervousness and make it easier to perform. It might be that your husband doesn’t have much experience with PDE5 inhibitors since you report that his limpness during your failed threesome was “completely unusual for him.” (Granted, he may have discreetly popped a Viagra or Cialis in the past that you weren’t aware of.) If he has no experience with these drugs, he should get a prescription—they could be a game changer, and they’re easy enough to obtain online with minimal provider contact. I don’t necessarily condone having minimal contact with a provider, but it’s clear that a lot of guys are embarrassed about this stuff, and don’t like visiting the doctor regardless of the issue, so telehealth companies like Hims and Ro are taking a lot of the discomfort out of the process. Yeah, going to a urologist could help Mike—what you describe sounds like a circumstantial ED issue that has psychological roots, but hearing from a doctor that Mike isn’t broken and this issue is fixable could make a big difference. Still, if the guy won’t go, you can’t make him. Maybe you wait it out a bit more, let the problem remain persistent, and Mike may drop his resistance to the doctor. For a non-medical intervention in the meantime, he could try a cock ring. It’s not foolproof, but it may help.&lt;/p&gt;

Your sister wasn’t necessarily asking for a solution to her problem, just for your ear and compassion. It sounds like she is more on the emotional side, while you lean pragmatic. It makes a certain kind of sense that you bought her a sex toy, given her issues, and I’m sure you meant well. But you did this, by your own admission, because of her dating problems. She reacted emotionally, but a version of, “You bought this for me because I couldn’t get a man,” is the truth. The gift may have, in fact, reminded her of her dating frustrations primarily, so much so that it didn’t have a shot at ameliorating her sexual ones—if she even has those! She may not be having issues finding sex, or she may already have sex toys she uses and likes, rendering the potential usefulness of your gift moot.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="90" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmay0i94p001w3b770tei01mx@published"&gt;If you don’t have the kind of relationship where you talk about sex and/or masturbation in any detail, and if you’ve never gifted her with a sex toy before, she probably found the dildo inappropriate. It’s really never a safe bet to give someone a sex toy, unless you’re intimately involved with them and know they like them. Did you act incorrectly? Well, kinda. I think your intentions were pure, but not necessarily well thought out, and when it comes to giving gifts, it really is the thought that counts.&lt;/p&gt;

I also haven’t been on a date. My life has pretty much been surrounded by doctors and hospitals as I learn to cope with chronic illness. But I’m at a point now where I’d like to date and maybe have sex again. But I don’t know where to start. I’m submissive, and this might sound weird, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2022/07/sexual-fantasy-smell-sex-advice.html"&gt;but the absolute most important thing is they have to smell “right.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            Science has pretty well established that the brain isn’t static; it changes and adapts throughout our lives in response to life events in a process called &lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/neuroplasticity" target="_blank"&gt;neuroplasticity&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Researchers are discovering this is especially true of female brains, which get remodeled significantly during the three Ps: &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/05/health/teen-tween-developing-brains-wellness/index.html"&gt;puberty&lt;/a&gt; (as do the brains of adolescent males), pregnancy and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/07/health/menopause-effect-brain-gupta-wellness"&gt;perimenopause&lt;/a&gt;.

            All three transitions are a frequent butt of pop-culture jokes: the  sulky, risk-taking teenager who only wants to be with friends; the scattered mom-to-be who leaves her cell phone in the fridge and can’t remember where she parked the car; and the hormonal middle-aged woman who can’t focus and spontaneously combusts with hot flashes.

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000f3b6mdfseylyx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But far from being laughable, these behavioral stereotypes are the external manifestations of big internal shifts, many of them linked to the effects of fluctuating hormones on the brain.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000g3b6md9args8h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cognitive neuroscientist Laura Pritschet, a postdoctoral fellow in the department of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, is fascinated by how female hormones, including estrogen and progesterone, affect the brain’s organization and functioning.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000h3b6m7fpfz720@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The reason I chose that field is because I was a budding neuroscientist as an undergrad, interested in brain networks and obsessing over how intricate everything was in the brain to simply allow us to have a personality or remember things,” Pritschet told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently, on his podcast Chasing Life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000i3b6m7u79h7fr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “At the same time in my personal life, I was surrounded by menopausal women who were talking about their cognitive complaints and their attention issues,” she said. “I thought we’ve got to connect these two together and understand this more.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000j3b6meb58bn78@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pritschet even volunteered as a “guinea pig” during graduate school, having her brain scanned and blood drawn for 30 days, across two complete reproductive cycles (both on and off birth control pills), to begin to answer the question of how the day-to-day fluctuations in hormones relate to the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8975130/" target="_blank"&gt;day-to-day changes in the brain&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000k3b6m9s4axi0h@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Around this time, other researchers were studying what happens in the brain during pregnancy, Pritschet said, looking at the brain before and after gestation. They found many changes, but because the studies took a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27991897/" target="_blank"&gt;snapshot approach&lt;/a&gt;, many questions were left unanswered.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000l3b6mnr7gqlf5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If there’s a 3 to 5% decrease in total gray matter volume, when is that occurring (during pregnancy), and how is it occurring?” Pritschet asked. “We’re missing huge gaps in what we call this metamorphosis.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000m3b6m5d3ucroc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;We know that the 40-week gestational window leads to these body adaptations to support the development of the fetus: We have increased plasma volume, immune function change, metabolic rate, oxygen consumption,” she said. “What does this trajectory look like over gestation?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6srj0000n3b6m4tqk9xla@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To find out, Pritschet and her team &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/16/health/how-pregnancy-changes-brain-study-wellness"&gt;tracked the brain changes&lt;/a&gt; in one woman, using MRI and blood draws, from pre-conception and fertility treatment throughout her pregnancy to two years postpartum. Their findings were published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01741-0" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt; in September.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

            “We saw this reduction in gray matter volume pretty much across the whole brain,” Pritschet explained. “We saw increased white matter microstructure and ventricle size.” (Quick anatomy lesson: The brain is made up of gray and white matter. Gray matter is where most of the brain’s thinking and processing takes place. White matter helps connect the different brain areas, allowing them to communicate with one another.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr000v3b6mchlf1wko@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The inflection point was birth,” Pritschet said. “We saw that those reductions persisted into postpartum, with slight recovery, meaning that certain areas of the brain showed this rise in gray matter volume in early postpartum. Others did not.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr000w3b6mfgdmmeob@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Pritschet said this “choreographed dance between major features of our brain” is in one respect a physical adaptation to the increased blood flow and swelling that comes with pregnancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr000x3b6mpj8vykm0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, the changes  may also be a preparation for the next stage: parenting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr000y3b6mlbxtaxxf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s a fine-tuning of circuits,” she explained. “We know that pregnancy is the lead-up to this time in your life where there’s a lot of behavioral adaptation that has to occur, and new cognitive demands, and a new cognitive load.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr000z3b6m5rjtc4sa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And so the idea here is that there is this pruning or this delicate rewiring to make certain networks or to make communication in the brain more efficient to meet the demands that are going to have to occur,” Pritschet said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00103b6mrusx1xhc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This theory is supported by earlier work. “The first pinnacle papers that came out looking at neuroanatomy in human women from preconception to postpartum found that degree of change in gray matter volume — that sort of reduction — correlated with various … maternal behaviors (such as bonding). Again, that’s all correlation,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00113b6my42uf1re@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That’s an area we need to do a lot more research on, and it needs a lot of context,” she said. “But you can expect that if there’s fine-tuning in these circuits that underlie cognitive or behavioral process, that the more fine-tuning it undergoes, the better performance you’re going to have. That’s the idea — but it’s so much more complicated than that.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00123b6mnqa8qzmk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt;hat    happens to the brain during pregnancy? Pritschet offers these three insights.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00133b6mwxox03ed@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The body is the outward sign of a lot of inner upheaval.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00143b6m5rfnesmz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Pregnancy is a transformative time in a person’s life where the body undergoes rapid physiological adaptations to prepare for motherhood,” Pritschet said via email. “But pregnancy doesn’t just transform the body — it also triggers profound change to the brain and reflects another critical period of brain development.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00153b6msg6kzdpl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She called this remodeling   an often-overlooked period of brain development that takes place well into a woman’s adulthood.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00163b6mr79by7ww@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Less gray matter may not sound very positive, but it happens for a reason.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00173b6mfyywoaz1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Despite what one might think, these reductions are not a bad thing, and in fact, are to be expected,” Pritschet said, noting that some of the losses are eventually regained. “This change could indicate a ‘fine-tuning’ of brain circuits, not unlike what happens to all young adults as they transition through puberty and their brain becomes more specialized.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00183b6miv7xuri0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These changes could also be a response to the high physiological demands of pregnancy itself, she said, “showcasing just how adaptive the brain can be.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h3 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmax6wc6d001e3b6mnfyb8w86@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="these-changes-could-affect-future-health-and-behavior" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        These changes could affect future health and behavior
&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr00193b6m9csq3658@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mapping these changes could open the door to understanding an array of other neurological and behavioral outcomes including postpartum depression, headaches, migraines, epilepsy, stroke and parental behavior.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr001a3b6ma4tqkavx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The neuroanatomical changes that unfold during (pregnancy) have broad implications for understanding vulnerability to mental health disorders … and individual differences in parental behavior,” said Pritschet.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmax6wbtr001b3b6mkcyjtpwc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It may even provide critical insight into how the brain changes over a lifespan, she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

The scan, which takes just 8 minutes, detects brain lesions centered on veins—a hallmark of MS—using a technique called T2*-weighted MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers introduced a simple diagnostic guideline known as the “rule of six,” confirming MS if six vein-centered lesions are found. This method not only improves patient comfort and reduces diagnostic delays but could also save healthcare systems millions by reducing hospital stays and complications from lumbar punctures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Non-Invasive Diagnosis:&lt;/strong&gt; The 8-minute MRI replaces the need for painful lumbar punctures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Rule of Six’:&lt;/strong&gt; Finding six vein-centered brain lesions confirms MS diagnosis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost and Time Savings:&lt;/strong&gt; Could save the NHS up to £5 million annually and speed up diagnosis by 3 months.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Nottingham&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experts from the University of Nottingham have proven that multiple sclerosis (MS) can successfully be diagnosed using an MRI scan, meaning patients no longer need to undergo a painful lumbar puncture.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, published in&lt;a href="https://tracking.nottingham.ac.uk/tracking/click?d=6YgN0DFQukPrBk1uG7SxtALcKtt2EvxsLokElavOHZDGzHyAa6JSlRDrxnK_c2pm89Rj0wPefihwqAUR-WfWEwk6sWrXM5T-YLVLUj6bgScuSf_jfL6tpUonbgB2vU9Gt3cvT52lVHXbtlWkFn0OAuJdnIUBEX7va0nHL8K2ld_hegOT7p2IwyyZRxdGHhTg-w2"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neurology&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Open Access&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://tracking.nottingham.ac.uk/tracking/click?d=6YgN0DFQukPrBk1uG7SxtALcKtt2EvxsLokElavOHZDGzHyAa6JSlRDrxnK_c2pm89Rj0wPefihwqAUR-WfWEwk6sWrXM5T-YLVLUj6bgScIpMCJLRFmrDuBtNOkBwr2LXYTSqoOGghZrcfqqiQodlMYO_1SFiU7aVsJj6OSE02gEj_5nj0h-f8eIFCJHjy5aA2"&gt;, &lt;/a&gt;an official journal of the American Academy of Neurology, experts from the School of Medicine found that by using a new MRI scan, they could successfully diagnose MS in 8 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110232"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/brain-scan-Ms-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The results show that the use of the T2*-weighted MRI along with the ‘rule of six’, supported the diagnosis of MS as an alternative to a lumbar puncture. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings could provide the NHS with a scientific approach to diagnosing MS which is safer, more cost effective and more importantly acceptable to patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MS is a neurological condition which affects around 150,000 people in the UK. It is notoriously difficult to diagnose as it has many symptoms but not all sufferers experience all of them and the disease can progress at different rates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is currently no agreement on the best way to diagnose MS. Frequently, people suspected of having MS have a standard MRI scan and undergo a lumbar puncture, where a thin needle is inserted between the bones in the lower spine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients often report they find it painful, and it can cause unintended complications requiring hospitalisation or time off work to recover. Although the fluid taken during a lumbar puncture can show evidence of disease, this is not always the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abnormalities are not found in everyone who has MS. Some people with conditions that can mimic MS, but need very different treatment, have similar lumbar puncture abnormalities. Both problems can lead to misdiagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lead author of the study, Professor Nikos Evangelou, Clinical Professor of Neurology at the University said: “More than half of all people diagnosed with MS in the UK have had at least one lumbar puncture, following the suspicion of MS diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings of our research are particularly exciting as we have now shown that we can give the diagnosis of MS without this painful procedure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used a clinical MRI scanner, of the type all neuroscience centres have, to carry out a special type of scan called a T2*-weighted MRI which is able to reveal lesions in the brain’s white matter that are centred on a vein &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; a known indicator of MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a conclusive diagnosis of MS, the team developed the ‘rule of six’, whereby if there were six lesions found with a central vein, this confirmed a diagnosis of MS without having to analyse all lesions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team carried out a prospective study, in Nottingham, Cardiff and London with patients who had a suspected, but not definite diagnosis of MS. Each patient was given an 8-minute MRI scan and a lumbar puncture and after 18 months, they were able to find out what the diagnosis was and whether it matched that of their initial scan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results show that the use of the T2*-weighted MRI along with the ‘rule of six’, supported the diagnosis of MS as an alternative to a lumbar puncture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of this study and previous research conducted in Nottingham and in the USA the International Committee for the diagnosis of MS, recently announced that the MRI scan, as first proposed by the Nottingham research team, is enough to diagnose MS. A lumbar puncture is no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professor Evangelou adds: “Not only will our findings have huge benefits for patients, but it will also mean cost savings for the NHS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People who have lumbar punctures are required to spend at least most of a day in hospital, and for a health service already at capacity, this creates more issues. If there are complications with the lumbar puncture the stay can be longer. With the MRI scan, it takes 8 minutes, is completely safe, and then you can go home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“On average, we think we will reach the diagnosis three months earlier and the change could save the NHS up to five million pounds each year, which can be reinvested in better services for our MS patients.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this MS and neuroimaging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#97f4fff6e5fbf8e3e3f2b9e0f6fbfbd7f9f8e3e3fef9f0fff6fab9f6f4b9e2fc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Charlotte Wall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://nottingham.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Nottingham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Charlotte Wall – University of Nottingham&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1212/WN9.0000000000000017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Comparison of the Diagnostic Performance of the Central Vein Sign and CSF Oligoclonal Bands Supporting the Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;” by Nikos Evangelou et al. &lt;em&gt;Neurology Open Access&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparison of the Diagnostic Performance of the Central Vein Sign and CSF Oligoclonal Bands Supporting the Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Background and Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The central vein sign (CVS) describes the presence of venules within multiple sclerosis (MS) brain lesions, visible on T2*-weighted MRI. In the upcoming revision of the MS diagnostic criteria, the simplified “rule of 6” (i.e., finding 6 lesions with a central venule) can support the diagnosis of MS as an alternative to lumbar puncture (LP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We evaluated whether a T2*-weighted MRI scan is more sensitive than oligoclonal bands (OCBs) for diagnosing MS at presentation with a typical clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). We also compared the tolerability of LP and the additional MRI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants requiring an LP to meet the 2017 McDonald diagnostic criteria for MS were enrolled in this multicenter, prospective, diagnostic superiority study from 3 UK neuroscience centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A six-minute T2*-weighted sequence was used to assess the CVS using 2 definitions: a 40% threshold of all eligible lesions and the rule of 6. These were compared with OCBs, using the clinical diagnosis at 18 months as the reference standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of 113 participants, 99 (mean age: 38, female: 73%) have completed all study activities: 80 were diagnosed with MS, 10 remained CIS, 8 had alternative diagnoses, and 1 remained without a diagnosis. No significant difference in diagnostic sensitivity was detected between 40% CVS threshold (90% [CI 81%–96%]) and OCB testing (84% [CI 74%–91%]) (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.332).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rule of 6 had a sensitivity of 91% (CI 83%–96%). Side effects were reported by 75% following LP compared with 9% following MRI. All participants preferred their MRI scan over their LP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVS and OCB testing is equally sensitive in supporting the diagnosis of MS in cases of typical CIS. CVS assessed using the 40% threshold, and the simpler rule of 6 produces equivalent diagnostic performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared with OCB testing, CVS testing seems safer and better tolerated by patients. Further studies are needed to evaluate CVS specificity, particularly outside of typical CIS cases, as studied here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Classification of Evidence&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study provides Class IV evidence that CSF OCBs and the CVS are equally sensitive in supporting a diagnosis of MS in patients presenting with CIS.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 15:24:21 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5zVkhQZ1dDMFI3V2dLOUMwSVBZOEhUQ2VhUHU5T29jTHEtNmpwcGV0Vy1xb1dvSTdLWW1STHZoZzc4ZENQbWdsTW9kNktmSjU5dFpBbU11VUhQWjFZQ2hSb2RxaEV3QQ</guid></item><item><title>优于Ozempic ：科学家揭示最有效的减肥药物- SciTechDaily | Better Than Ozempic: Scientists Reveal Most Effective Weight Loss Drug - SciTechDaily</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxQbmdWSVcxNlNCZ3NmbkRpR2Fma0RhOE1WRE1rQnhfaEs3X2twVUhTTUtITVcwVWhCWHhqZHBtcWR4aC1WM283MEJwRy1leVlLMUtHZi0wc2tXa1ZNVjZ1Z3hxQmdQZHd4bWVPX2thblBQTjdIZlp2TWdkNFNhZGV1QjBaZDg0TVd1bUthNi1uV0FlaWU4NExGZDE2SQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SciTechDaily</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 15:06:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxQbmdWSVcxNlNCZ3NmbkRpR2Fma0RhOE1WRE1rQnhfaEs3X2twVUhTTUtITVcwVWhCWHhqZHBtcWR4aC1WM283MEJwRy1leVlLMUtHZi0wc2tXa1ZNVjZ1Z3hxQmdQZHd4bWVPX2thblBQTjdIZlp2TWdkNFNhZGV1QjBaZDg0TVd1bUthNi1uV0FlaWU4NExGZDE2SQ</guid></item><item><title>官员警告说，在大都会人寿体育场举行的夏奇拉音乐会上潜在的麻疹暴露- NBC新闻 | Officials warn of potential measles exposure at Shakira concert at MetLife Stadium - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinwFBVV95cUxNSnBLSWlOTzVnYl85U3IzR3lVNmhZQ0JMNm16cllyY1BvSGZfS0J5TFB2UGZpSHF0OWhRTHFfc0Fyblh5b3c0a0tKN011ZUdGYmxKNzc5MWlwYlFMazJpcWJhWUFmSjVOS1Y1WEdBWWJxOFBhTFJtdmtpSHVjaVJweU5iLTZYTGVyeW05Qm1KLWZnNnNBX05vRmtsVVVRU2fSAVZBVV95cUxOcXMtTGhHSnZCUHJRUW1STXo4ZEdvcDlGcE1laHoxV2FTTGVmZW85YTUwQzQ1VzdFemExUVVqdmVVMmFyMHo5MTljWWo0ZnQ5UjhpbUJkZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;New Jersey health officials issued a warning about a potential measles exposure during &lt;a href="https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/how-to-get-to-shakira-concerts-metlife-njtransit-strike/4185716/" target="_blank"&gt;the Shakira concert at MetLife Stadium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;On Tuesday, the New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) announced that a non-New Jersey resident attended the concert while infected with the disease.

  &lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span class="tag-term"&gt;News Release&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="publishdate"&gt;&lt;span property="dc:date" datatype="xsd:dateTime" content="2025-05-21T11:00:00-04:00" class="date-display-single"&gt;Wednesday, May 21, 2025&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Scientists design gene delivery systems for cells in the brain and spinal cord&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;
NIH-funded breakthrough could enable targeted therapies for many neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research teams funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have created a versatile set of gene delivery systems that can reach different neural cell types in the human brain and spinal cord with exceptional accuracy. These delivery systems are a significant step toward future precise gene therapy to the brain that could safely control errant brain activity with high precision. In contrast, current therapies for brain disorders mostly treat only symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new delivery systems carry genetic material into the brain and spinal cord for targeted use by specific cell types. This platform has the potential to transform how scientists can study neural circuits. It provides researchers with gene delivery systems for various species used in research, without the need for genetically modified, or transgenic, animals. Examples include illuminating fine structures of brain cells with fluorescent proteins and activating or silencing circuits that control behavior and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Imagine this new platform as a delivery truck dropping off specialized genetic packages in specific cell neighborhoods in the brain and spinal cord,” said John Ngai, Director of the NIH’s &lt;em&gt;Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies® &lt;/em&gt;Initiative, or The BRAIN Initiative&lt;em&gt;®&lt;/em&gt;. “With these delivery systems, we can now access and manipulate specific cells in the brain and spinal cord – access that was not possible before at this scale.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new delivery tools, which use a small, stripped-down adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver DNA to target cells, can be broadly applied across many species and experimental systems, including small tissue samples removed during human brain surgeries. The delivery systems have been tested, or validated, in intact living systems, which is an important step for introducing new tools for widespread use. The newly published toolkit includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="spaced"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Dozens of delivery systems that selectively target key brain cell types, including excitatory neurons, inhibitory interneurons, striatal and cortical subtypes, brain blood vessel cells, and hard-to-reach neurons in the spinal cord that control body movement and are damaged in several neurological diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Computer programs powered by artificial intelligence (AI) that can identify genetic “light switches,” known as enhancers, that turn genes on in specific brain cell types, using data from many different species – cutting considerable time and effort for scientists looking for these genetic switches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, this collection of research tools will significantly accelerate understanding of the human brain. Importantly, the toolkit enables access to specific brain cell types in the prefrontal cortex, an area that’s critical for decision-making and uniquely human traits. With other tools in the collection, scientists can better study individual cells and communication pathways known to be affected in several neurological diseases. These include seizure disorders, ALS, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and Huntington’s disease – as well as various neuropsychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AAV-based treatments are already approved for some conditions, such as spinal muscular atrophy for which a 2016 approval of a gene therapy known as Zolgensma transformed the lives of infants and young children who once faced severe disability or early death. The new collection of gene delivery resources lays the groundwork for more precise treatments that target only affected cells in the brain, spinal cord, or brain blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The toolkit is available at distribution centers including &lt;a href="https://www.addgene.org/collections/brain-armamentarium/"&gt;Addgene&lt;/a&gt;, a global supplier of genetic research tools. This collection of publications offers researchers standard operating procedures and user guides for these tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The work is supported by the NIH’s &lt;em&gt;Brain Research Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies® &lt;/em&gt;Initiative, or The BRAIN Initiative&lt;em&gt;®&lt;/em&gt;. Funding issued less than four years ago launched a large-scale, team-run project to design new molecular tools that can be useful to many research laboratories.

              &lt;p&gt;A common class of antidepressant medications might be even more useful than we thought. Research out today suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, can fend off cancer and boost the immune system’s defenses against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles, led the study, &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(25)00502-1"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in Cell. In mice and other lab experiments, they found that SSRIs shrunk a variety of cancers, improved the immune system’s ability to kill cancer cells, and bolstered the effectiveness of immunotherapy. The researchers now hope to conduct clinical trials of SSRIs for cancer in humans.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Serotonin, a hormone with many important functions, has a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ctm2.1750"&gt;complicated relationship&lt;/a&gt; with cancer. While it appears to promote the growth of certain tumor types, it also seems to enhance our immune response to cancer. Accordingly, scientists have hoped that existing drugs that interact with serotonin, including many antidepressants, could be repurposed to fight cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several years ago, the UCLA researchers &lt;a href="https://stemcell.ucla.edu/news/drug-commonly-used-antidepressant-helps-fight-cancer-mice"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a study showing MAO inhibitors—early generation antidepressants that regulate serotonin by inhibiting MAO—had an anticancer effect in mice. But these older drugs can cause serious side effects and interact badly with many other drugs or foods. So the researchers next decided to see if they could find a similar effect by targeting a different protein that interacts with serotonin, SERT. And as luck would have it, we already have existing and safer drugs that can inhibit SERT, the SSRIs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers used SSRIs on mouse and human models of several different cancers (some mice were given cancers derived from human cells, for instance): melanoma, breast, prostate, colon, and bladder cancer. On average, the treatment reduced the size of these tumors by more than 50%. Looking closer, the team also found that SSRIs appeared to make certain immune cells—killer T cells—better at recognizing and killing cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“It turns out SSRIs don’t just make our brains happier; they also make our T cells happier—even while they’re fighting tumors,” said senior study researcher Lili Yang, a professor of microbiology, immunology and molecular genetics at UCLA, in a &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1084293"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the university. “SSRIs made the killer T cells happier in the otherwise oppressive tumor environment by increasing their access to serotonin signals, reinvigorating them to fight and kill cancer cells.”&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Yang and her team then paired SSRIs with another treatment that boosts the immune system’s response against cancer, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy; these drugs work by inhibiting certain proteins that normally keep immune cells from attacking tumors. In tests with mice, the combination further shrunk melanoma and colon cancer tumors, and in some cases, it even seemed to completely eradicate the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So far, the findings come from mice and other lab experiments, so we’re still a long way from SSRIs being the next big thing in cancer treatment. But the fact that these drugs are already approved to treat depression is an added boon, the authors say. Compared to experimental treatments, for instance, it would take much less money and resources to develop and potentially win approval of SSRIs for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;UCLA, on behalf of the lead researchers, has filed a patent covering their combination approach, and the team is next looking to put their hypothesis to the test in an actual human trial.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our goal is to design a clinical trial to compare treatment outcomes between cancer patients who take these medications and those who do not,” said Yang, also a researcher at UCLA’s Goodman-Luskin Microbiome Center and the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With any luck, the same drugs that help ward off the blues can also become part of our arsenal against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

Loneliness was closely tied to a cluster of defensive symptoms—pain, fatigue, and low mood—which were especially severe among the poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that social connection helped reduce these symptoms, but the protective effects were strongest for those living in poverty. These findings suggest that social relationships are crucial to buffering the health impacts of economic disadvantage and highlight the need for targeted community support in low-income populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Income-Loneliness Gap:&lt;/strong&gt; 49% of low-income individuals felt lonely vs. 15% of high-income peers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health Toll:&lt;/strong&gt; Lonely people in poverty showed the highest levels of pain, fatigue, and low mood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social Buffering:&lt;/strong&gt; Strong relationships most effectively reduced symptoms in the poorest groups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Oxford University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new study from the University of Oxford, published in &lt;em&gt;Public Health&lt;/em&gt;, shows that European people in the lowest income deciles are much more likely to feel lonely than those in the highest income deciles, despite no difference in how often they socialise. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, both poverty and loneliness were strongly associated with higher scores on a defensive symptom cluster characterised by elevated levels of pain, fatigue and low mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that the symptom-reducing effects of social connection were strongest for people living in poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110228"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two lonely people." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/poverty-loneliness-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The relationships observed between income level, loneliness and the symptom cluster held even when accounting for things like living arrangements and marital status. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings have important implications for social, economic, and health policy, suggesting that strong social relationships may serve as important buffers against some of the health consequences of poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The defensive symptom cluster refers to set of frequently co-occurring and mutually reinforcing symptoms that, understood from an evolutionary perspective, represent the body’s response to danger and scarcity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humans evolved in groups which provided access to resources and protection from danger; when we feel socially excluded or isolated our bodies respond with a set of symptoms that are meant to protect us, for example pain helps protect us from injury, and fatigue and low mood may help us conserve energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers, led by Dr Arran Davis of the School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography, University of Oxford, examined data from a survey of 24,505 respondents across 20 European countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key findings include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;People in the lowest income decile were much likely to report feeling lonely in the last week than people in the highest income decile; 49% compared to just 15%. This is despite there being no difference in the amount of time people in different income deciles reported socialising with family, friends, and colleagues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People who report feeling lonely have, on average, higher scores on the symptom cluster. The average lonely person has a symptom cluster score that is higher than 67% of not lonely people. However, the difference in the average symptom cluster score between lonely people and not lonely people is significantly larger in the lowest income decile than the highest income decile. The average lonely person in the lowest income decile has a symptom cluster score higher than 73% of non-lonely people in the same income decile. In the highest income decile, the average lonely person has a higher symptom cluster score than 65% of non-lonely people.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30% of lonely individuals from the lowest income decile had high symptom cluster scores compared with just 2% of non-lonely people in the highest income decile, suggesting that social relationships play a particularly important role in influencing the health outcomes of people living in poverty.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The relationships observed between income level, loneliness and the symptom cluster held even when accounting for things like living arrangements and marital status.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Past research has identified supportive social relationships as buffers to the negative effects of poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings from this study suggest that as material resources decrease the importance of social resources increase, with those who are both in poverty and lonely displaying the highest symptom cluster scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author, evolutionary anthropologist, Dr Arran Davis said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The relationship between poverty and poor health is well established, and previous research suggests that loneliness may be as bad for you as smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study shows that for people who are both on low incomes and lonely the health costs are particularly marked. I hope this study inspires more research into the factors that lead people to feel socially disconnected and to the development of policies that support strong communities in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this poverty and loneliness research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5a36332020333f743e2f342e323528343f1a3b3e373334743522743b39742f31" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Lizzie Dunthorne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ox.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Oxford University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Lizzie Dunthorne – Oxford University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2025.02.037" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Associations amongst poverty, loneliness, and a defensive symptom cluster characterised by pain, fatigue, and low mood&lt;/a&gt;” by Arran Davis et al. &lt;em&gt;Public Health&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Associations amongst poverty, loneliness, and a defensive symptom cluster characterised by pain, fatigue, and low mood&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0015"&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perceived social isolation is associated with increased pain, fatigue, and depression.

Multilevel linear regression was used to test for the effects of loneliness, income decile, and their interaction on a symptom cluster variable that was the average of respondent &lt;em&gt;z&lt;/em&gt;-scores on self-reported pain, fatigue, and low mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hypothesised that loneliness and low income would be interactively associated with higher symptom cluster scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0025"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those from lower income deciles were much more likely to feel lonely (48.7 % in the lowest income decile; 15.2 % in the highest income decile), despite no differences in reported time spent socialising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Multilevel linear regression indicated statistically significant associations consistent with our hypotheses: (1) lonely individuals score 0.447 &lt;em&gt;SD&lt;/em&gt; higher on the symptom cluster, (2) for every increase in income decile, symptom cluster scores decrease by 0.022 &lt;em&gt;SD&lt;/em&gt;, and (3) a loneliness by income interaction on the symptom cluster (&lt;em&gt;b&lt;/em&gt; = −0.018), with the association between loneliness and the symptom cluster being strongest amongst those in lower income deciles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0030"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both loneliness and low income were associated with higher scores on the symptom cluster, and social relationships were especially strong buffers of the symptom cluster for individuals experiencing poverty.

&lt;p&gt;Up your protein. Add collagen. Walk 10,000 steps. Get more sleep. The list of tips for living longer is endless, and much of the advice comes from people with more social media followers than qualifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Tom’s Guide, the fitness team works hard to cut through the noise. In our latest search for evidence-backed insights, we found a fascinating study that suggests strength training could be a key piece of the longevity puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published in the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38595265/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38595265/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research&lt;/a&gt;, the study followed more than 14,000 adults aged 50 and over for 12 years, using grip strength as a simple measure of muscle health. It found that people with lower grip strength had a 45 percent higher risk of death during the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The takeaway is simple: strong muscles aren’t just about how you look, they could help you live a longer, healthier life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-grip-strength"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is grip strength&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grip strength is exactly what it sounds like: how hard you can squeeze something with your hand. Think of it as your hand’s power meter. But it’s more than just winning at arm wrestling or opening stubborn jars. It’s actually a quick, simple way for doctors and researchers to get a snapshot of your overall muscle health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? Because your grip says a lot about how strong your muscles are elsewhere in your body. As this study shows, keeping that strength up might just help you live longer and feel better as you age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-are-the-best-ways-to-build-better-strength"&gt;&lt;span&gt;What are the best ways to build better strength&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is, you don’t need to live at the gym or lift massive weights to build strength.

But menopause can also take a toll on your oral health — a lesser-known symptom that deserves a lot more attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Let’s start with the basics: Menopause is officially diagnosed when a person hasn’t had a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-period-underwear-ncna1273695" target="_blank"&gt;menstrual cycle&lt;/a&gt; for 12 months. Leading up to that is perimenopause, a transitional period when reproductive hormones, particularly estrogen, begin to drop. That hormonal shift is responsible for many of the symptoms associated with menopause, including the ones that can mess with your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;To understand what’s going on, I spoke to two experts (a gynecologist and a dentist) who broke down how menopause affects your teeth and gums, plus what you can do to stay ahead of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/menopause-oral-health-rcna208207?featureFlagAix=true#anchor-2dfa70" id="anchor-2dfa70" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;How does menopause affect your oral health?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Estrogen plays a major role in maintaining the health of your oral tissues. When levels drop, your mouth can feel the impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“During menopause, the decline in estrogen can lead to significant changes in the oral cavity, including dry mouth (xerostomia), burning tongue (glossodynia), increased gum sensitivity and changes in taste,” says Dr. Somi Javaid, a board-certified OB/GYN and founder of &lt;a href="https://hermd.com/" target="_blank"&gt;HerMD&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Hormonal shifts can also raise your risk of gum inflammation, gingivitis and periodontal disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Saliva production is another issue. “Saliva is essential for neutralizing acids, washing away bacteria and preventing tooth decay,” says Dr. Pia Lieb, a cosmetic dentist at &lt;a href="https://www.cosmeticdentistrycenternyc.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Cosmetic Dentistry Center NYC&lt;/a&gt;. “Without enough saliva, you’re more vulnerable to cavities, infections, and even trouble speaking or swallowing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Menopause can also increase your risk of osteoporosis, which can affect the jawbone and potentially lead to tooth loss or complications with dental implants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/menopause-oral-health-rcna208207?featureFlagAix=true#anchor-ade8fc" id="anchor-ade8fc" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;How to protect your teeth during menopause&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Now for the good news: You don’t have to kiss the health of your teeth goodbye just because you’re in perimenopause or menopause. According to our experts, you can do several things to prevent declining oral health during this time of life. Below, some of the most effective tactics: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="break-above body-ul body-list-el"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice good oral hygiene&lt;/strong&gt;: “Brush twice daily with fluoride toothpaste, floss daily, and use alcohol-free &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/best-mouthwashes-rcna190988" target="_blank"&gt;mouthwash&lt;/a&gt;,” says Lieb. Regular flossing is also crucial, adds Javaid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay hydrated:&lt;/strong&gt; If dry mouth is an issue, increase your water intake, says Lieb. “You can also use saliva substitutes to keep your mouth hydrated.” &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go to the dentist regularly:&lt;/strong&gt; “Regular checkups and cleanings become even more critical during and after menopause,” says Lieb. Plus, routine deep cleanings will prevent plaque buildup. Early detection and intervention can mitigate the progression of oral health complications associated with menopause,” says Javaid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk to your doctor: &lt;/strong&gt;Make an appointment with your gynecologist to discuss overall treatments for menopause that may be suitable for you. “Hormone therapy (HT) may be beneficial for many women, particularly when oral symptoms are part of a broader systemic hormonal deficiency,” says Javaid. “A comprehensive evaluation is essential to tailor treatment to the patient’s needs.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;a href="/select/shopping/menopause-oral-health-rcna208207?featureFlagAix=true#anchor-0d2a3f" id="anchor-0d2a3f" class="scrollLink"&gt;&lt;h2 class="body-heading"&gt;Menopause oral health products to shop&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Experts told us that maintaining oral hygiene is crucial during menopause.

Researchers analyzed DNA methylation, a cellular marker of aging, in men aged 50 to 72 who followed a nutrient-rich, plant-forward lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who consumed more methyl adaptogen foods showed significantly greater reductions in epigenetic age, even after adjusting for weight changes and starting biological age. These results reinforce the idea that specific dietary choices can meaningfully impact how we age at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epigenetic Aging:&lt;/strong&gt; Measured through DNA methylation, epigenetic age reflects biological, not chronological, aging.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methyl Adaptogens:&lt;/strong&gt; Foods like garlic, green tea, turmeric, and berries were linked to slower cellular aging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lasting Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Benefits remained significant even after accounting for weight and initial age differences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Impact Journals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A new research paper was published in &lt;em&gt;Aging&lt;/em&gt;, titled “Dietary associations with reduced epigenetic age: a secondary data analysis of the methylation diet and lifestyle study.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this study, researchers led by first author Jamie L. Villanueva from the University of Washington and the National University of Natural Medicine, along with corresponding author Ryan Bradley from the National University of Natural Medicine and University of California, investigated how diet influences epigenetic aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110220"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows foods entwined into a DNA strand." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/plant-diet-epigenetic-aging-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;These findings support earlier results from studies on Mediterranean and traditional Japanese diets, both known for their health benefits. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They found that certain plant-based foods containing natural compounds called methyl adaptogens were associated with a decrease in epigenetic age. This effect was measured using DNA methylation, a marker that reflects how the body ages at the cellular level. The findings suggest that targeted food choices may help slow the aging process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Epigenetic age refers to how old a person’s cells appear biologically, rather than their actual age in years. DNA methylation patterns, which are chemical tags on DNA, can indicate whether someone is aging faster or slower than expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this study, researchers used Horvath’s epigenetic clock, a widely accepted tool, to measure changes in epigenetic age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis included healthy men aged 50 to 72 who had previously completed an eight-week program featuring a plant-based, nutrient-rich diet, along with guidance on exercise, sleep, and stress management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers focused on individual dietary differences to understand why some participants experienced greater improvements in epigenetic age than others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The study found that those who ate higher amounts of methyl adaptogen foods—including turmeric, rosemary, garlic, berries, green tea, and oolong tea—experienced greater reductions in epigenetic age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These benefits remained significant even after accounting for weight changes and participants’ starting epigenetic age, suggesting that the foods themselves had a direct impact on aging markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In hierarchical linear regression, foods investigated as polyphenolic modulators of DNA methylation (green tea, oolong tea, turmeric, rosemary, garlic, berries) categorized in the original study as methyl adaptogens showed significant linear associations with epigenetic age change (B = -1.21, CI = [-2.80, -0.08]), after controlling for baseline epigenetic age acceleration and weight changes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The natural compounds in methyl adaptogen foods are known to influence how genes behave by affecting DNA methylation. Previous studies have shown that these compounds may support healthy aging and help lower the risk of conditions such as heart disease and cognitive decline.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While this study involved a relatively small group of middle-aged men, it adds knowledge to growing global research showing that diets rich in polyphenols—found in vegetables, fruits, and teas—are associated with slower aging. These findings support earlier results from studies on Mediterranean and traditional Japanese diets, both known for their health benefits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Future research should include larger and more diverse populations and use updated epigenetic aging tools to confirm these results. Based on current evidence, this study highlights a practical, food-based strategy that may help reduce epigenetic aging and support long-term health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this diet and aging research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#670a02030e06270e0a170604130d08121509060b144904080a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Ryan Braithwaite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://impactjournals.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Impact Journals &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Ryan Braithwaite – Impact Journals&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.206240" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dietary associations with reduced epigenetic age: a secondary data analysis of the methylation diet and lifestyle study&lt;/a&gt;” by Ryan Bradley et al. &lt;em&gt;Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dietary associations with reduced epigenetic age: a secondary data analysis of the methylation diet and lifestyle study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background: &lt;/strong&gt;Aging is the primary risk factor for developing non-communicable chronic diseases, necessitating interventions targeting the aging process. Outcome measures of biological aging used in these interventions are mathematical algorithms applied to DNA methylation patterns, known as epigenetic clocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Methylation Diet and Lifestyle study was a pilot randomized controlled trial of a diet and lifestyle intervention that utilized epigenetic age as its primary outcome, measured using Horvath’s clock. Significant reductions in epigenetic age post-intervention were observed but with notable variability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose:&lt;/strong&gt; This research aimed to identify dietary components associated with epigenetic age change across groups. Contributing factors to variability, such as weight changes and baseline differences in chronological and epigenetic age, were explored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; In hierarchical linear regression, foods investigated as polyphenolic modulators of DNA methylation (green tea, oolong tea, turmeric, rosemary, garlic, berries) categorized in the original study as methyl adaptogens showed significant linear associations with epigenetic age change (B = -1.21, CI = [-2.80, -0.08]), after controlling for baseline epigenetic age acceleration and weight changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the intervention group lost significantly more weight than the control group, these changes were not associated with epigenetic age changes in the regression model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that consuming foods categorized as methyl adaptogens may reduce markers of epigenetic aging.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 14:20:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE93WDhhdDBMcVJreXhCbTdUTV9QVDNXWHhyWk5vS0VLNUU2X19YOGJjeXphejdsOV81Yko4WVZkYmxpdkt3UlNtODNGdVEtOW5jMmJWN3ZLRHBUY3FidW5pM2MxNXpMUGNNTGNpaG4xM2s</guid></item><item><title>阿尔茨海默氏症的血液检测：须知-《纽约时报》 | A Blood Test for Alzheimer’s: What to Know - The New York Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMid0FVX3lxTE1najFwOHNYSVVLWHEzVDI0cnd1RjVhNGNkQ2ZrVmJiM2xSMTJQUG05ZXBfQWtISVNtUElKNEVYTDBkSHA0dm5nU2p0Q2NLN3lfMEJ5NGhra1N4T3oyYlllcUtYajBrMXctNGRxS3Y1dU9zTDZQaThV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;A blood test that can help diagnose Alzheimer’s disease has received clearance from the Food and Drug Administration. This is a step toward a goal of scientists and doctors to one day be able to diagnose a confounding illness with the prick of a finger. But there is still a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Here is what to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-13o6u42 eoo0vm40" id="link-65060e55"&gt;What is the test, and how should it be used?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The test, manufactured by Fujirebio Diagnostics,&lt;span class="css-8l6xbc evw5hdy0"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;is intended to be used only by specialists in Alzheimer’s, the F.D.A. said. Its mouthful of a name — Lumipulse G pTau217/ß-Amyloid 1-42 Plasma Ratio — describes what the test measures: levels of two proteins, amyloid and tau, that are hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In people who develop Alzheimer’s, amyloid begins to accumulate and form plaques in the brain more than 20 years before any symptoms of cognitive impairment. Tau accumulates later, forming tangles in the brain, and is much more closely correlated with cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="css-13o6u42 eoo0vm40" id="link-5c27f38e"&gt;Can people who don’t have memory problems take the blood test?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;No. The F.D.A., and Alzheimer’s experts, emphasized that the blood test should be given only to people who are already experiencing cognitive decline and are ages 55 and older. Moreover, it should not be used on its own to diagnose or to rule out Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Other clinical evaluations or additional tests should be used for determining treatment options,” &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-blood-test-used-diagnosing-alzheimers-disease" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;the F.D.A. said&lt;/a&gt; in a statement, adding that “the results must be interpreted in conjunction with other patient clinical information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The current gold standard for diagnosing Alzheimer’s still involves either imaging using PET scans, which are expensive, or spinal taps, which are invasive.

CLU helps prevent the buildup of toxic amyloid-beta plaques and tau proteins, both key drivers of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice, DDL-357 reduced levels of phospho-tau, improved mitochondrial function, and enhanced cognitive performance in maze tests. Though still in early stages, this candidate drug may work alongside existing treatments and could eventually be used for other neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s and ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeted Protein:&lt;/strong&gt; DDL-357 boosts secreted clusterin (sCLU), which protects against toxic brain buildup.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Gains:&lt;/strong&gt; Treated Alzheimer’s model mice showed improved memory and cognitive function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; The drug may aid treatment for other diseases like ALS and Parkinson’s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCLA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As researchers work to improve treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, new research by UCLA Health identified a candidate drug that reduces levels of a toxic form of a protein in the brain caused by the disease and improved memory in mice by boosting production of a protective protein.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a study published in the &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; journal &lt;em&gt;npj Drug Discovery,&lt;/em&gt; UCLA Health researchers targeted the protein clusterin (CLU), which is crucial in preventing the build-up of amyloid-beta plaques and tau proteins that that disrupt communication between brain cells and lead to memory impairment — a hallmark symptom of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110216"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/Alzheimers-drug-memory-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;One molecule, known as DDL-920, was found to restore cognitive function in Alzheimer’s model mice by jumpstarting the brain’s memory circuitry, specifically targeting gamma oscillations that orchestrate circuits for cognition and working memory. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a decade ago, a variant of the gene that encodes clusterin was identified as the third strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease. It was recently reported that increased CLU protein could provide protection against Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UCLA Health researchers led by Varghese John identified a candidate small molecule, DDL-357, that increased concentrations of secreted clusterin (sCLU) in Alzheimer’s mouse models, resulting in a reduction of the toxic protein phospho-tau and improvement of mitochondrial function, both associated with progression of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DDL-357 also improved the memory of treated mice in maze-based cognitive tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings open the door to the development of new treatments that not only target the underlying causes of Alzheimer’s disease but also restore lost cognitive function – something that existing therapies have yet to achieve,” said John, a professor of neurology and director of the Drug Discovery Laboratory (DDL) at the Mary S. Easton Center for Alzheimer’s Disease Research and Care at UCLA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While the drug candidate is still in pre-clinical testing and far from human trials, initial results suggest it could work in concert with existing Alzheimer’s disease treatments and may also be effective in treating other neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis”, John said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug is one of the latest that John and fellow UCLA Health researchers at the Drug Discovery Laboratory have identified as potential candidates for development to treat Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One molecule, known as DDL-920, was found to restore cognitive function in Alzheimer’s model mice by jumpstarting the brain’s memory circuitry, specifically targeting gamma oscillations that orchestrate circuits for cognition and working memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another study published in April found the molecule DDL-218 worked to increase levels in mouse brain of another protective protein, sirtuin 1, that is lower in people who carry apolipoprotein E4, a genetic variant of apolipoprotein, that confers the greatest risk for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These potential drug candidates provide an opportunity for the testing of new complimentary therapies for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this Neuropharmacology and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f2859a9d8781869d9cb29f97969c9786dc87919e93dc979687" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Will Houston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://ucla.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Will Houston – UCLA&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s44386-025-00009-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Discovery of a small molecule secreted clusterin enhancer that improves memory in Alzheimer’s disease mice&lt;/a&gt;” by Varghese John et al. &lt;em&gt;npj Drug Discovery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discovery of a small molecule secreted clusterin enhancer that improves memory in Alzheimer’s disease mice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite substantial research and drug discovery efforts, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) remains the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, underscoring the urgent need for novel therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mutation in the clusterin (CLU) gene that hinders expression of the cyto-protective secreted isoform of clusterin (sCLU) that affects the aggregation and clearance of two key proteins implicated in AD, Aβ and tau, is the third most significant genetic risk factor for late-onset AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we present findings from our drug discovery program to identify small molecules that enhance sCLU levels and assess their impact on AD pathology and cognition in a murine model of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high-throughput screening campaign identified two classes of epigenetic modulators that increase sCLU levels with subsequent medicinal chemistry efforts leading to bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitor new chemical entities (NCEs) with enhanced potency, drug-like properties, and oral brain bioavailability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lead candidate NCE, DDL-357, increased brain sCLU in the murine ApoE4TR-5XFAD model of AD in a subchronic study. In a follow-up chronic study in the murine 3xTg-AD model, DDL-357 reduced phospho-tau in brain and led to improvements in mouse performance and memory in the Barnes maze testing paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proteomic analysis of brain tissue from both AD models revealed changes in proteins involved in mitochondrial function and synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings reveal the potential of sCLU enhancement as a target for therapeutic development in AD and support the continued development of the preclinical lead candidate.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 13:57:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE9HaVRZUld0dFZGSFg4VUJHRkhaTGV3bzBySmRBUzRiekdtQTluUEtOMVFZaHk3WUV4UFFMOEtEZlpPTmF1a3NpNDlUdUN4M1dBaFpSMkh1aWV1dVlEc3M2YkhfTGJZRlk3U2ZNWTBn</guid></item><item><title>一些节育使用者数年没有经期—安全吗？ - CNN | Some birth control users go years without a period — is it safe? - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxQeWRBNTZTWlhOS2I1QjFmaVJaQ3VpTzl6VDExSE9wSVc0cjBSZlhEb050OUFVRUE3RGZ0a0phTW1Sa3RnZDBUZWhlbC02QXlWUl9zVGQtOEdLMDdyS1Z3YWVtNFpxMENlY1lMeE9mZjRBbXB3Q3pGYk15NENlb291dGFlMDVNMEXSAYwBQVVfeXFMTXlBb0ZHOVJpOU5JRm5sVEVqWG5uSm9wWXJCc3gyQkh3UTJPNE5oSUk0X0pTVDdybU5FU05WdW9ST2V0UEtXclRuUGNfaE9mU2s4aGlwdHBOR1VxM25lNFp3bk9aUTNRWWcxOUdudjNocF8yb00zeTZNRkZvWHo1TXFhSVZMM3BPcTlLOXY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Don’t like having your period? Hormonal birth control can be used for more than just preventing pregnancy — it’s also a popular way to go months or even years without a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/06/health/nutrition-early-menstruation-wellness"&gt;period&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd00023j6n529amkuf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Continuous use birth control involves taking hormonal pills without what’s called a placebo week or using other methods such as an implant, ring or injections without a break. This method can end the regular bleeding associated with periods, as well as the cramps, migraines and other symptoms of menstruation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            As social media becomes a hotbed for amateur medical advice and personal anecdotes, posts about getting off the pill and preventing pregnancy through nonhormonal methods rake in thousands of views daily on apps like &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/getting-off-birth-control?lang=en" target="_blank"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;. As influencers share their fears about infertility and the possible harms of suppressing your body’s natural processes, reproductive experts say myths and misinformation about hormonal birth control are on the rise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            To understand more about the risks, rewards and science behind using birth control to forego menstruation, I had a chat with reproductive health expert Dr. Kavita Nanda. As an obstetrician-gynecologist and clinical researcher for the North Carolina-based human development nonprofit FHI 360, Nanda has spent over 25 years studying continuous use birth control and other forms of contraception.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How does hormonal birth control work?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd00073j6n6agm2m3s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Dr. Kavita Nanda: &lt;/strong&gt;Combined contraceptives use synthetic forms of estrogen and progesterone&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;together. Combination methods work to prevent pregnancy by preventing ovulation, which is the release of an egg from the ovaries. Other methods use synthetic progesterone&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;only, including pills, implants, injectables and intrauterine devices, or IUDs. Both combined and progestin-only methods make the mucus in your cervix thicker, which makes it hard for sperm to enter the uterus, and the lining of your uterus also remains thin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd00083j6najdzp7sj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: What is continuous use? And how does it differ from other methods?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd00093j6nr0not83r@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Nanda: &lt;/strong&gt;The standard way to take combined contraceptives is cyclically, every day for three weeks, and then you have a break in the hormones for a week. You either don’t take a pill, or you take a placebo for a week, so you have what’s called a withdrawal bleed. The lining of the uterus sheds, and that’s what people call a “period,” although it’s really just a hormone-free withdrawal bleed. But when we talk about continuous use, you don’t take any breaks. The uterine lining stays thin and intact, and this means that users can go weeks, months or even longer, without a “period.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000a3j6n4tagypqh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: How long can you safely go without a monthly bleed?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000b3j6nmv52co2i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Nanda: &lt;/strong&gt;There have been &lt;a href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004695.pub3/full" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; comparing continuous versus cyclical use, and it’s just as effective and just as safe. There’s no medical reason to have a period or withdrawal bleed when you’re on hormonal contraceptives. As long as you don’t have any contraindications (medical conditions) for the birth control pill, you don’t have contraindications for the continuous use of the pill.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000c3j6nfvhb7bt2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Historically, before contraception, women didn’t necessarily bleed all the time, because a lot of time was spent either being pregnant or breastfeeding. In both of those conditions, there’s no monthly bleeding, often for months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmavkdsvd000d3j6nng331tw8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now, if you’re not pregnant or breastfeeding, you’re not on hormonal contraception, and you don’t have a monthly period — that’s something you do need to discuss with your provider, because that could signal an issue.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Are there any side effects specific to continuous use?&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Nanda: &lt;/strong&gt;The side effects in general are similar to those with cyclical use. For example, you might have nausea, breast tenderness and headaches (at any time). With continuous use, some people experience unexpected breakthrough bleeding or spotting, especially initially, but this usually improves over time, and many people do achieve amenorrhea or (the) cessation of menses. For some people, it may take three to four months.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Nanda: &lt;/strong&gt;There’s no evidence that long-term use of hormonal contraception — whether it’s combined hormonal interception, taken continuously or cyclically — causes infertility, and fertility typically returns within a month or two. Basically, once you stop, the (synthetic) hormones go away very quickly from the blood, ovulation is no longer suppressed, your normal estrogen and progesterone production resume. Assuming that you had normal menstrual cycles before, they would resume. (One exception is) if you’re taking something like the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10335688/#:~:text=The%20proportion%20of%20fertility%20return%20among%20pregnant%20women%20who%20used,100%25%20and%2097.8%25%20respectively." target="_blank"&gt;Depo Provera contraceptive injection&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t cause infertility, but it may take longer for fertility to return after injections.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;CNN: Why were placebo pills invented if there’s no harm in skipping them?&lt;/strong&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Nanda: &lt;/strong&gt;When the combined oral contraceptive pill was developed in the 1950s, the now-standard 21 days of active pills followed by a seven-day hormone-free interval was not based on medical necessity, but rather on cultural and strategic reasons. At the time, there was a widely held belief that menstruating every 28 days was a sign of normal female reproductive function.

            To align with that expectation, the regimen was designed to mimic a natural menstrual cycle, with a monthly withdrawal bleed intended to reassure both users and physicians that they were not pregnant — important in an era before home pregnancy tests were readily available — and, at the time, to help ease religious and societal resistance to contraception.

            &lt;strong&gt;Nanda: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s really a personal preference and a discussion between a person and their provider. Someone might not want to have a period for years, or some people prefer to bleed three times a year. Some people feel reassured by monthly bleeding. Continuous use may be especially helpful for people who have painful periods, heavy periods, endometriosis, migraines, iron-deficiency anemia, physical or intellectual disabilities, and transgender individuals.

Researchers found that people with HSV-1 were 80% more likely to have Alzheimer’s, while those treated with antiviral medications had a 17% lower risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings align with other evidence that HSV-1 may trigger inflammation and amyloid-beta accumulation in the brain, hallmarks of Alzheimer’s pathology. Although the study is observational and can’t prove causation, it highlights the potential for antiviral therapy as a protective strategy and urges greater public health focus on herpes virus prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;80% Higher Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; People with HSV-1 were significantly more likely to develop Alzheimer’s.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antiviral Benefit:&lt;/strong&gt; HSV-1 patients who took antiviral drugs had a 17% lower Alzheimer’s risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological Link:&lt;/strong&gt; HSV-1 may drive brain inflammation and amyloid buildup, contributing to dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;BMJ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Symptomatic infection with the virus responsible for cold sores around the mouth–herpes simplex 1, or HSV-1 for short—may have a key role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease, suggests a large pharma industry-funded US study published in the open access journal &lt;em&gt;BMJ Open&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But treatment with antiviral therapy seems to be linked to a lower risk of this type of dementia, suggesting that treatment to quell HSV-1 symptoms may be protective, the findings indicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110212"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a woman and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/hsv1-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Nearly two thirds (65%) of those with Alzheimer’s disease were women. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, around 35.6 million people worldwide live with dementia, and 7.7million new cases are diagnosed every year, say the researchers. Alzheimer’s disease comprises 60%–80% of all dementias, with total costs for its treatment reaching US$305 billion in 2020, they add.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various infectious agents have been implicated in the development of Alzheimer’s disease, and the most studied of these is HSV-1, which affected more than two-thirds of under 50s around the globe in 2016 alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To shed further light on the mooted role of HSV-1 in Alzheimer’s disease and the potential protective effects of antiherpetic drugs, the researchers drew on a large set of US administrative claims data (IQVIA PharMetrics Plus) for the period 2006-21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease were matched for age, sex, geographical region, database entry year, and number of healthcare visits with those without any history of neurological disease, resulting in a total of 344,628 case–control pairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly two thirds (65%) of those with Alzheimer’s disease were women. Their average age was 73 and they tended to have more co-existing conditions—all risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all, 1507 (just under 0.5%) people with Alzheimer’s disease had been diagnosed with HSV-1 (0.44%) compared with 823 (just under 0.25%) of those in the comparison (control) group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the risk of Alzheimer’s disease rose in tandem with age. But, overall, the likelihood of an HSV-1 diagnosis was 80% higher among those with Alzheimer’s disease, after adjusting for potentially influential factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the 2330 people with a history of HSV-1 infection, 931 (40%) used antiherpetic medication after their diagnosis. And they were 17% less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease than those who didn’t use these treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at the potential role of other herpes viruses, including HSV-2, varicella zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus. Both HSV-2 and varicella zoster virus infections were also associated with a heightened risk of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exactly how HSV-1 and other neurotropic viruses might heighten the risk of dementia isn’t clear, point out the researchers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, studies have shown that inflammatory alterations in the brain caused by HSV infection are pivotal in [Alzheimer’s disease] development,” they explain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It has been reported that Aβ peptides are deposited in response to HSV infection and protect host cells by blocking viral fusion with the plasma membrane, pointing to HSV as a potential risk factor for [Alzheimer’s disease]. Consistently, Aβ exhibits antimicrobial properties against various pathogens, including HSV-1,” they add.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSV-1 DNA is also found in the plaques characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease, and people carrying the ApoE ε4 allele, the most common genetic risk factor for the disease, are more susceptible to HSV infections, they note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an observational study, and as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. And the researchers acknowledge that HSV-1 infections before the patient’s inclusion in the database weren’t known, added to which many people with the infection don’t have symptoms, while others might not seek treatment when they do–all factors that might influence the findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But their findings are in line with those of other studies. And they suggest: “While the molecular mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated, these results are indicative of a possible role for antiherpetic therapy in mitigating dementia risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And they conclude: “These findings place an even greater emphasis on viewing the prevention of herpes viruses as a public health priority. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this virology and Alzheimer’s disease research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3c515958555d4e59505d485553524f7c5e5156125f5351" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Emma Dickinson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://bmj.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;BMJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Emma Dickinson – BMJ&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;The findings will appear in &lt;em&gt;BMJ Open&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 13:26:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFBIZU80b2Jfa3Y5ek5ROHg0d2ZBS0F3S1I4SDByVmdQX0Y3QmJfblNkR0xBZE53dlktRDMyMHVpdDhwVDRyZy1nYWcwS0RKTWVSdGR5clhKSF82ajZVMUxoRGthcjczeF82TzA5azVjRQ</guid></item><item><title>这些餐厅的食物对我的肠道有什么影响？ -《西雅图时报》 | What has all this restaurant food done to my gut? - The Seattle Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxPV245TWhYTXExUG9Dc1ZXSHJSV2VEcmtIT1lLbWxseXA4VmZWYjFHWTlpSFd5YzV3THdmbFFoQmxjdmJzaVQzNVZubTBRNG53eHdQRjNTNUNzQWlKRGdvMFYwNHh0em8wVF9GMGxQeWRfb3lyTmxmd1hRRzNDclh0aEQ4TklncF9vb1g2VzN3OWxOR3NlNkg3MmdB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimgFBVV95cUxPV245TWhYTXExUG9Dc1ZXSHJSV2VEcmtIT1lLbWxseXA4VmZWYjFHWTlpSFd5YzV3THdmbFFoQmxjdmJzaVQzNVZubTBRNG53eHdQRjNTNUNzQWlKRGdvMFYwNHh0em8wVF9GMGxQeWRfb3lyTmxmd1hRRzNDclh0aEQ4TklncF9vb1g2VzN3OWxOR3NlNkg3MmdB?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;What has all this restaurant food done to my gut?&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;font color="#6f6f6f"&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/font&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/stories/CAAqNggKIjBDQklTSGpvSmMzUnZjbmt0TXpZd1NoRUtEd2lscWR2OERSR3JfOEVJMml3UUV5Z0FQAQ?hl=en-US&amp;amp;gl=US&amp;amp;ceid=US:en&amp;amp;oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;View Full Coverage on Google News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</description><author>The Seattle Times</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 13:19:15 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPV245TWhYTXExUG9Dc1ZXSHJSV2VEcmtIT1lLbWxseXA4VmZWYjFHWTlpSFd5YzV3THdmbFFoQmxjdmJzaVQzNVZubTBRNG53eHdQRjNTNUNzQWlKRGdvMFYwNHh0em8wVF9GMGxQeWRfb3lyTmxmd1hRRzNDclh0aEQ4TklncF9vb1g2VzN3OWxOR3NlNkg3MmdB</guid></item><item><title>产后精神病可能在家庭中流行-神经科学新闻 | Postpartum Psychosis May Run in Families - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE9PQklzNjN4X3pvelN3aWVqN0g3YzNaWDAwVXE5Yi1rZ3l1aklENy05Sk9TQkRvakNpd2dVNHJ1TG1NdC1TWWhScmVDTkZYVWU0RmIyWmM0V1U0OWd5VVpMTG9BSXRUenYyY1VZNDhmblVaUFU?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Women are over 10 times more likely to develop postpartum psychosis if their sister has experienced the condition, according to a major study of more than 1.6 million women. This rare but severe disorder, marked by hallucinations, paranoia, and disorganized thinking after childbirth, can have life-threatening consequences if not treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight a strong familial risk, particularly when bipolar disorder is also present, underscoring the need for early screening and increased awareness. While the relative risk is high, the actual risk remains low, at 1.6%, but understanding family history could allow for preventive interventions and targeted mental health support during the vulnerable postpartum period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Familial Risk:&lt;/strong&gt; Having a sister with postpartum psychosis raises a woman’s risk more than tenfold.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bipolar Link:&lt;/strong&gt; The risk increases to 14x if the sister also has bipolar disorder.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call for Awareness:&lt;/strong&gt; Despite its severity, postpartum psychosis remains understudied and underdiagnosed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Mount Sinai Hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mount Sinai researchers have found for the first time that a woman is more than 10 times more likely to develop postpartum psychosis if her sister had experienced the condition, compared to a woman with a sister who did not. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings, which were published May 19 in the &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt; and highlighted at the American Psychiatric Association’s annual meeting press briefing the same day, suggest both genetic and shared environmental influences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postpartum psychosis is a rare but serious mental illness that leaves a devastating impact on mothers in the vulnerable weeks and months after childbirth. It carries increased risk of suicide and infanticide if left untreated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the early warning signs of postpartum psychosis are severe mood swings, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, insomnia, paranoia, and thoughts of self-harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the devastating ramifications of the disorder, it remains vastly understudied and a challenge for physicians to diagnose and address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every woman of childbearing age and their physicians need to know about the existence of, severity, symptoms, and familial risk for postpartum psychosis so it can be promptly diagnosed and, hopefully, prevented,” said Veerle Bergink, MD, PhD, Director of the Women’s Mental Health Center at Mount Sinai and co-senior author of the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“At present, too many women at higher risk don’t know it and are left on their own with a new baby and no support. We hope these study findings will help move the needle and impart change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With wider recognition of this particular condition and risk factors for it, we can implement changes to help ease the burden for women during this postpartum period.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mount Sinai study team examined the records of more than 1.6 million women from the Swedish nationwide registries, identifying 2,514 women who had experienced postpartum psychosis within three months of their first childbirth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to finding that a woman is more than 10 times more likely to develop postpartum psychosis if her sister had the condition, the Swedish registry study showed that the presence of bipolar disorder in a sister doubles the woman’s risk of developing postpartum psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women with a sister who has bipolar disorder and postpartum psychosis were shown to be at highest risk; their risk for developing postpartum psychosis themselves is 14 times increased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study measured relative recurrent risk for the disorder, which implies increased likelihood of its appearance in another member of the family. This differs from actual risk, which refers to the probability of developing the condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers learned that while the relative risk of postpartum psychosis is quite high in full siblings, the absolute risk for women with an affected sister is still low at 1.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings support the view that even though there is overlap between postpartum psychosis and bipolar disorder, these are in fact, distinct conditions,” said Dr. Bergink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope this new data will help move the needle and impart change. With wider recognition of this particular condition and risk factors for it, measures can and should be taken to help ease the burden for women during this postpartum period.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond expanding awareness around postpartum psychosis, this study provides a solid foundation for the next step of research, aimed at early recognition and prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work that involves identifying the genes responsible for this disease is already underway at Mount Sinai in the lab of Behrang Mahjani, PhD, Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re using complex molecular data to investigate the genetic architecture of the disease,” says Dr. Mahjani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Knowing what specific genes are involved will help us dive into the mechanisms and triggers of postpartum psychosis, and if they’re hormone- or immune-related. And that, in turn, could lead us to novel treatments and ways to proactively inform women of their risk before they’re faced with a severe health crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this postpartum psychosis and genetics research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e0858c899a8182859488ce848f978c898e87a08d8f958e9493898e8189ce8f9287" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Elizabeth Dowling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mountsinai.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Mount Sinai Hospital&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Elizabeth Dowling – Mount Sinai Hospital&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.20230576" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Familial Risk of Postpartum Psychosis&lt;/a&gt;” by Veerle Bergink. &lt;em&gt;American Journal of Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Familial Risk of Postpartum Psychosis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Objective:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postpartum psychosis is one of the most severe psychiatric conditions, with high risks of suicide and infanticide if untreated. Although genetic factors contribute to the risk of postpartum psychosis, the extent of familial risk remains to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors compared relative recurrence risk across different family relationship types, hypothesizing that relative recurrence risk for postpartum psychosis varies by degree of genetic relatedness and is higher in female full siblings than in cousins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cohort study consisted of 1,648,759 women from the Swedish nationwide registers, of whom 2,514 (0.15%) experienced postpartum psychosis within 3 months of their first-ever childbirth. The authors estimated the relative recurrence risk of postpartum psychosis for female full siblings and cousins as a measure of familial risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Results:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relative recurrence risk of postpartum psychosis in full siblings was 10.69 (95% CI=6.60, 16.26) when adjusted for year of and age at childbirth. Although cousins showed an elevated relative recurrence risk, these results did not reach statistical significance (1.78, 95% CI=0.70, 3.62).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the higher familial risk of postpartum psychosis among full siblings, the absolute risk for women with an affected sibling was relatively low, estimated at 1.60% within the entire population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The observed increased risk of postpartum psychosis in full siblings suggests both genetic and shared environmental influences. However, the lack of significant results in cousins hampers a more accurate distinction between these factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, despite increased relative recurrence risk in siblings, their overall likelihood of developing postpartum psychosis remains low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study underscores the need for further research to better understand the intricate interplay of genetics and shared environment in the development of postpartum psychosis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 12:59:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE9PQklzNjN4X3pvelN3aWVqN0g3YzNaWDAwVXE5Yi1rZ3l1aklENy05Sk9TQkRvakNpd2dVNHJ1TG1NdC1TWWhScmVDTkZYVWU0RmIyWmM0V1U0OWd5VVpMTG9BSXRUenYyY1VZNDhmblVaUFU</guid></item><item><title>营养学家为您的健康评选最佳（和最差）包装熟食- HuffPost | Nutritionists Rank The Best (And Worst) Packaged Deli Meats For Your Health - HuffPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisgFBVV95cUxPNE54QWQ5UUdmaEpEMUQxSDQ0MVFYSU0tNGM3ZGtadDlrSnM0TkV2YTZJbkJ6aXo4Z3Z2bFcySG9Id25DdlE5dnoxbGs1WUdGMjYxeUNETkl1SUxjQllZaEVjcDEzX1NQZ2hKN0pleXdXN2N2UllDT1FSWXlqdnFab19FRHE5eHItelRuWjZ6Yk83TnpFZ2wzSS1QODk3dkxfR244VnhodEZnWXc2cDFKalZB0gG3AUFVX3lxTFB2b1hKN0VDVzRPSjRjS19jUEt4V1lKUFQ0NlZndEtqRVdzV0piYXBRcDdVellSeGdObmRBSjF1NkowXzRILWNFeDZmc2lpeDhlWTE1T0g0aVVzT2hFMXZtUjJkN3dkdjR6M2htd2tyVEZ3bTVwS3haekQ5Tmt0XzVQbkFBMnBrSnhBMUFhOW5ZNzJLNUNhSHlpZmJkNS1JV3VFYmhrUFkzb0VUTkowR1Jxai1DcFhkUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="entry__content-list js-entry-content js-cet-subunit"&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Deli meat might be a lunchbox classic, but let’s be honest — not all cold cuts deserve a spot between your bread. Some are lean, protein-packed powerhouses that make throwing together a meal a breeze. Others are salt and saturated fat bombs that sneakily contain added sugars. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So, how can you tell what’s what?

That’s why the first step when shopping for deli meat is to flip the package over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“For deli meats, opt for leaner meat options, like turkey breast or ham, to limit saturated fat,” Farrell shared. “When it comes to sodium, look for ‘no salt added’ options that have less than 100 mg sodium per serving. Deli meats can be a sneaky source of added sugars, so look for options without it.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to RDN &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.360girlsandwomen.com/about" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Sue-Ellen Anderson-Hayes" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682740fbe4b0f10918e319ed" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.360girlsandwomen.com/about" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sue-Ellen Anderson-Hayes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, owner of 360Girls&amp;amp;Women and B.E.A.T Gestational Diabetes, based in Boston, Massachusetts, one simple method when shopping is to check the % Daily Value (DV) on the Nutrition Facts label. “Aim for DV (Daily Value) of 5% or less per serving of fat, sodium and added sugar,” she said. Translation: If the number next to the nutrient is 5% or under, it’s a good one to grab.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Honey ham ranks fourth on the experts' list.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dietitians rank the top-selling deli meats in the U.S.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Farrell and Villaseca ranked &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/15-most-popular-deli-meats-in-the-us-1173629/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="the top 10 deli meats" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="682740fbe4b0f10918e319ed" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/15-most-popular-deli-meats-in-the-us-1173629/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;the top 10 deli meats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by sales&lt;span&gt; in the U.S., &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;focusing on sodium content, protein, fat and overall nutritional value.

Chicken breast (5th most popular)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 10 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium: 400 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat: 2 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is another lean option, but it can be a bit bland, so bump up the flavor with herbs, mustard or crunchy veggies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;3. Roast Beef (3rd most popular) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 17 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium: 350 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat: 2 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leanest and lowest-sodium choice of the red meat options, it’s a solid pick if you’re craving red meat without going for richer options like capicola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;4. Honey Ham (2nd most popular) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protein:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; 10 g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sodium:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; 570 mg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fat:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; 2.5 g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is still relatively lean, but as the name suggests, honey ham contains 2-3 grams of sugar per serving. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Keep an eye on sodium — check a few different brands and choose the one with the lowest sodium option,” Villaseca advised.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;5. Pastrami (8th most popular) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 12 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium: 604 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat: 3.3 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Pastrami is flavorful and protein-rich, but comes with a bump in fat and sodium.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;6. Corned Beef (4th most popular) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 15 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium: 765 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat: 8 g (including 3 g saturated fat)&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cut from the leaner part of the brisket, corned beef is high in protein, but it’s also one of the saltiest options. It’s b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;est saved for the occasional Reuben.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;7. Capicola (9th most popular)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 10 g &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium: 540 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat: 12 g &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capicola is more of a charcuterie star than a basic sandwich filler. It’s a traditional Italian cured meat (like prosciutto) that’s been dry-cured and aged rather than cooked. Its high fat content and marbling give it a chewy texture and rich flavor, making it the perfect pair for crackers, cheese and other cured meats, rather than as a standard deli slice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;8. Sopressata (least popular)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 12 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium: 960 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat: 14 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If you love it for snack plates, just balance it out with fiber-rich sides like whole grain crackers, fruit, or nuts,” Villaseca recommended. “It’s all about the big picture.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;9. Salami (6th most popular)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 12 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sodium: 995 mg&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat:18 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;With a long shelf life and being portable, salami is handy for hikes or road trips. Pair with hydrating fruits like oranges or apples if you’re eating it on the go.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;10.

They find new ways to maintain social relevance — often by doing things older generations don’t understand. (Don’t believe me? Just try to guess what any of their slang terms mean.) One of the latest teen trends is something that might raise a few eyebrows among parents, due to safety and privacy concerns: location tracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although teens crave independence from their parents, they are voluntarily sharing their real-time whereabouts with their friends. Popular phone tracking app Life360 recently found that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.life360.com/blog/gen-z-location-sharing-study" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Gen Z is 70% more likely" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68222bd5e4b09ed53250130c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.life360.com/blog/gen-z-location-sharing-study" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt; &lt;span&gt;Gen Z is 70% more likely&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; than any other age group to share their location with friends. And 94% of Gen Z surveyed said their lives benefit from location sharing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2025, Snapchat announced that its location-sharing Snap Map has more than 400 million monthly active users, per&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/snap-map-reaches-new-milestone-of-400m-monthly-active-users/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name=" TechCrunch" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68222bd5e4b09ed53250130c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/07/snap-map-reaches-new-milestone-of-400m-monthly-active-users/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt; TechCrunch&lt;/a&gt;.

Of course, that explained why he kept ‘randomly’ showing up wherever she was.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__attribution caption-cli"&gt;- Dr. Cameron Caswell, adolescent psychologist&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in the olden days (circa 2006), teens would update their Myspace status to let you know what they were up to. Later, they “checked in” to places on Foursquare and &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/impact/topic/facebook"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, shared real-time updates on Snapchat and Instagram stories, and tweeted every detail of their lives. Now, they use Snapchat’s Snap Map, Life360, or Apple’s location sharing to share with their friends everywhere they are in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This isn’t new,” Caswell said. “In a world where nearly everything is shared, this doesn’t feel invasive to teens — it feels normal. It’s just another way they stay looped into each other’s lives.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Teens also use apps like this to track their parents, according to Caswell, whose own daughter will text her if she sees her mom is at Ulta and ask for lip gloss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“For many teens, location sharing is about connection and a sense of safety,” Caswell explained. “It’s their way of saying, ‘You’re in my circle’ and ‘I’ve got your back.’” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding The Risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Even though sharing your location with friends might be popular, it doesn’t come without consequences. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.evolutiontohealing.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Cheryl Groskopf, " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68222bd5e4b09ed53250130c" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.evolutiontohealing.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cheryl Groskopf, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;an anxiety, trauma, and attachment therapist based in Los Angeles, sees teens sharing their locations as a way “to manage anxiety, track social dynamics and feel less alone.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“There’s comfort in knowing where your people are, especially in a world where teens constantly feel like they could get left out, replaced or excluded,” she said. “But that comfort is fragile — it relies on constant access (which leaves their nervous system hypervigilant to feeling ‘left out’).”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;“Location sharing can intensify FOMO (fear of missing out) and social exclusion,” said Dr. Cameron Caswell, an adolescent psychologist.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“If you’re checking someone’s location because you don’t trust what they’re telling you — or because they don’t trust you — then it’s already crossed into a control dynamic,” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Groskopf &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her practice, she’s seen teens “spiral” when they spot their friend at a party they weren’t invited to, or “because someone didn’t respond fast enough, but ‘was clearly at home.’” She explained, “It becomes a setup for overthinking, panic and social surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Teens shouldn’t use location sharing when it’s being used to avoid rejection, manage someone else’s anxiety, or prove loyalty,” she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;McInnis said, “Teens sharing their location and having their friends track them could harm their mental health.” Constantly seeing (and comparing) your friends’ social activities “can lead to feelings of inadequacy,” she added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Caswell agreed. “Location sharing can intensify FOMO (fear of missing out) and social exclusion,” she said. “Seeing a group of friends hanging out without them — even unintentionally — can make them feel lonelier and more left out.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to these emotional risks, there are physical risks, too. Like a teen’s location data being available to someone who might wish them harm. “In the wrong hands, it can make [teens] more vulnerable to stalking, harassment or even predatory behavior, especially if they are in controlling relationships,” Caswell said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s A Gender Gap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Teen girls may be more likely to use location sharing as a way to feel safer. According to the Life360 survey, 70% of Gen Z women believe their physical well-being benefits from location sharing. In the field, our experts also found that females were more likely to do this.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Caswell said that “mostly girls” will openly share their location with friends, “both for fun and because it makes them feel safer knowing someone always knows where they are.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, this sense of safety is a double-edged sword, as it can “increase the risk of stalking, harassment or even sexual violence,” Caswell said. “Especially when their location is shared with the wrong person, which is often someone they know and trust.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Groskopf warns of the dangers girls and femme teens may experience when their use of location-sharing is weaponized against them. “It can easily turn into emotional surveillance disguised as closeness,” she explained. (For example, a friend or partner telling them, “If you trust me, you’ll let me see where you are.”)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“I see these kinds of patterns play out in high-control dynamics — friends or partners checking locations not to stay safe, but to manage anxiety, jealousy or power,” Groskopf said. “And girls are way more likely to internalize that and comply, even when it feels off. They’re more likely to be conditioned to avoid conflict, manage other people’s emotions, and keep the peace — even if that means overriding their own boundaries.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why teaching your kids how to set boundaries, in real life and online, is important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setting Boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Teaching your teen how to handle location-sharing in a safe way starts with conversations around consent and the ability to say no.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When asked if there is a safe way for teens to share their locations, Groskopf said, “Only if there’s real consent, boundaries, and the freedom to opt out without punishment.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this case, the punishment could be feeling guilt-tripped or rejected by a friend. “That means not just technically having the option to stop sharing, but knowing you won’t be guilted, shut out, or shamed if you do,” Groskopf continued. “A parent saying, ‘I want to know where you are in case of emergency’ is one thing. A friend saying, ‘Why’d you turn off your location?’ with passive-aggressive silence afterward is something else entirely.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She added, “Safe tracking only works when it’s not being weaponized to regulate someone else’s fear, jealousy or insecurity.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To Talk To Your Teen About Location Sharing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Start the conversation with curiosity, not criticism, Caswell said. “Instead of banning [location sharing], I recommend walking through privacy settings together and having calm conversations about why they’re sharing in the first place,” she said. “Is it for safety? To feel connected to their bestie? Because they feel pressured to?

Aged 53 at the time, Topol considered healthy aging to be of deep scientific — and personal — interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="5Q265BEZZZAWZB42LOJMK7CEMU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;He also suspected the answer was genetic. So, with colleagues, he spent more than six years sequencing the genomes of about 1,400 people in their 80s or older with no major chronic diseases. All qualified, Topol felt, as “Super Agers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XIOV4OSS5FCRTHALOV3K34V3GE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But they shared few, if any, genetic similarities, he and his colleagues found, meaning DNA didn’t explain their super aging. So, what did, Topol and his colleagues wondered?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LFF4KYKHKZEBJA44GLJC7IIQOU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;His new book, “Super Agers: An Evidence-based Approach to Longevity,” is his answer. Synthesizing hundreds of studies about health, disease and aging, his book talks about a future where advanced drugs, biochemistry and artificial intelligence should allow us to turn back the clock and slow how rapidly we age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="URRLUOKUIBDG7GL3PE7MRHSJSY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Already, he says, we can dramatically increase our chances of becoming super agers with a few lifestyle tweaks, such as eating better (&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2024/01/02/ultra-processed-foods-identification/" target="_blank"&gt;avoid processed foods&lt;/a&gt;) and sleeping enough (seven hours is good).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GYWEURRXZ5EHJFNGRFX2L475A4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But there’s one lifestyle change, he says, that influences aging far more than any other.

In fact, it’s the only intervention in people that has shown any effect on slowing the body-wide aging clock, meaning it appears to change how rapidly we age. Of course, other lifestyle factors, like diet and social interactions, are critically important. But if there is one thing that has the most exceptional evidence for healthy aging, it’s exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WXXUHMAG4BHJBEXVDTOR6MJUDI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;For decades, as a cardiologist, I would always be emphasizing aerobic exercise to my patients, whether that was walking or bicycling or swimming or elliptical or you name it. I’d say to get at least 30 minutes most days. And that’s what I did myself. I didn’t really accept the importance of strength training until I began researching the book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="JTKNCXIFUNGCTN3GHYCK5INHOU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;When I saw all the evidence, I became totally convinced. Resistance training and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/01/18/grip-strength-muscles-aging/" target="_blank"&gt;grip strength&lt;/a&gt; have extraordinary correlations with healthy aging. And so, well over a year ago, I went from being pretty much a weakling — I never worked on any muscles, except my legs, from doing lots of bicycling and hiking and walking — to now I’m stronger than I’ve ever been in my life, and it’s just been terrific. I’ve got better balance and posture, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YNGPY56FTJB2RD7DJZ2PHJ5OAQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s your strength training routine like? Do you work with a trainer?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GGQX4HLDNVDXXNMDKTUFBNNSBI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Well, I didn’t want to hurt myself and I was definitely a beginner, so I did start off with a trainer a couple of times a week. But now it’s only about once a month. And I tell people, you don’t have to have a trainer. You can find good information about &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2023/strength-training-gym-workout/" target="_blank"&gt;getting started online.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZZIIO7XNUNAGFNLSLSNNTHTACY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do you work out at a gym or at home?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4S5VJXFWMVERLGXMC2CVIUMRPE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;I do it all at home. It saves time and expense. I tell my patients, the more convenient and practical your training is, the more likely it is to get done, and that sure works for me. I usually do &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2025/7-minute-workout-science-original/" target="_blank"&gt;planks, lunges, squats,&lt;/a&gt; sit-ups on a medicine ball, the &lt;a href="https://www.acefitness.org/resources/everyone/exercise-library/16/cobra/?srsltid=AfmBOor7DCjIuV5QS3oUEUpBWisLK6Qqrd72YVg7GOPcZbmgz3hdA6fI" target="_blank"&gt;cobra&lt;/a&gt;, and a bunch of other floor exercises. I also use resistance bands. And I’ve learned about the importance of things like balance,&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24978931/" target="_blank"&gt; standing &lt;/a&gt;on a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiuYyJOikPE" target="_blank"&gt;foam&lt;/a&gt; pad, that kind of thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="YMH7LEZSVFH53GWS4HGM2654HY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Yes, I do. I also try to touch my shin while standing on one foot. All of this, the strength training, the balance, the rest, it’s made me feel so &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2024/fitness-test-by-age-exercise/" target="_blank"&gt;strong and fit&lt;/a&gt;. I feel like I should have done this decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="OINYFCZLHJFJ7HFSVFUKAWWPQA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is it ever too late to start doing this kind of training?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ZJ35C7XXOVCBJB6P2JXDUZ5WSU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Absolutely not. It’s never too late. This idea that you can’t build muscle or strength as you age is silly. No matter what your age, and I’m not young anymore, you’re fully capable of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/11/29/weight-lifting-aging/" target="_blank"&gt;getting stronger and athletically fit.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="A5P643CSXBFTDOV4DF6CMIAMZA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;You still do aerobic exercise?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WE4ECBJLZJEJNP5MRRUCYV4LJI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Of course. I used to do aerobics six out of seven days a week, for 30, sometimes 40 minutes. Now I do aerobics about four times a week and integrate the resistance training the other days. And sometimes I do both. But it’s still less than an hour. I don’t have enough time to do more and that’s an important point. When I talk to my patients about exercise, we get into the details of their lives. They’re working. They’re tired. So we talk about when they can fit in time for exercise. Do they have a lunch break? Maybe they can go for a brisk walk. Or do lunges at home later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PJ3C3LREFBDJBBTRXJZ3LJBA2M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the book, you talk about how being outside and being with other people are both important for healthy aging. What about exercising outside with some friends?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="CVI6MZSN45EUBOIIXSTVV5HUPY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Oh, yeah, that’s great. The data suggests that, as we get older, we tend to become recluses. And that’s not good for healthy aging. And being in nature — I never would have thought that would be important for health. But the data are strong. If you can be outside moving around in nature with friends, that’s a twofer, a threefer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4YPQ24C7XBBUBFIJ6NIPQ3UNLY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What’s the endgame here?

The goal is extending our healthspan, our years of life that are without the major age-related diseases, especially cancer, cardiovascular disease and neurodegeneration. What we can see from studies is that you can get seven to 10 years of extra healthy aging from lifestyle factors, especially exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="66YBDO2GJRAGFNP5QKJKFJEI5Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;b&gt;What age do you want to live to?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WE37TD4KLRCENIPSWPBRXKEXNY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Well, I don’t have any of the age-related diseases yet. So, as long as that goes on, I’d be happy to get well into my 80s and beyond. I’d say that if you’re 85 and you don’t have any of those diseases, you’ve hit the jackpot. I’m doing my best to get there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="NJCSBX3EJZEXHDPDBGOTAQKI3I" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have a fitness question?

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="102" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavgw6gj000x3b7724jx3mip@published"&gt;My boyfriend has been having a series of rolling health issues that require emergency room trips, which is awful. But the worst thing is how he acts when he’s there: He doesn’t ask questions, push for care, or remind the medical staff that he’s alive. He had a cardiac event instead of warning the nurse about his symptoms because he worried he was “bothering” the guy who had other patients. In every ER I’ve been to, if you aren’t firm to the point of pushy, you won’t get medical care. I work two hours away, so I can’t always be there immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="229" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavgw6iv000y3b77qosxztg2@published"&gt;I love and care for him, but I’m not his mom. Going to the doctor or the ER when things go wrong, but then not actually asking any questions or telling the doctor about his symptoms is becoming a huge problem. He’ll go home, and the problem will continue untreated, and I’ll end up driving him back to the ER when I get home, or we’ll have to make a second expensive specialist appointment because he didn’t ask for answers the first time. I can’t always be there, and honestly, navigating doctors for an adult who won’t do it for himself is the least sexy thing I can imagine. I know I need to be sympathetic because he’s sick and scared, but I’m mad. I know self-advocacy wouldn’t make him not sick, but it would help! I’m out of PTO and worried about what will happen next time he has an emergency if I can’t leave work. As a teenager, I was hospitalized alone in a foreign country where I didn’t speak the language, and broken bones/work accidents/severe asthma have sent me to ERs in the States plenty of times since. I’ve always come out metaphorically fighting. I know it sucks, but if you don’t tell people what you need in an understaffed system, you won’t get it. What can I do? Telling him to be firm isn’t helping.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavgw6op00113b77m2eqq3cy@published"&gt;I don’t want to come off as too harsh here, so I’ll start off with an admission: I once cried because I thought my husband (then fiancé) didn’t drink enough water. He was fine. I just worried that he might one day become dehydrated. So, I totally get loving someone and wanting them to take better care of themselves. But that little breakdown over hydration concerns is now a joke in my marriage because, well, it was ridiculous!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="79" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavgw6qp00123b771ntisqrv@published"&gt;You have to remind yourself, like I did, when I realized that: This is an adult we’re talking about. You mentioned that you’re not his mom. And it doesn’t sound like he’s even complained to you or asked for help. Also, it’s not as if he has a dangerous disease and is refusing treatment. He’s going to the hospital, he’s just not being quite as assertive as you would be. That’s allowed. And it’s not an automatic death sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="148" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavgw6sp00133b77opw7jtsf@published"&gt;I think you’re right that self-advocacy and assertiveness help to get results in medical settings, but the healthy thing to do would be to share that insight with him and then just stop. Don’t push. Don’t stress. Let him make his own choices, reminding yourself that all different kinds of people with all different kinds of personalities find their way in life without your guidance. And if it feels hard to imagine washing your hands of the situation, given your love and care for him, think of it this way: At this point, you’re bossing him around and being angry and frustrated, but you’re not actually succeeding in getting him better care. So what is there to lose if you allow him to manage things on his own? If it’s partially the finances you’re worried about, he can schedule and pay for the pricey specialist follow-up visit himself.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="66" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavgw70c00143b77t7w1mad9@published"&gt;One last thought: I often find that when I’m really wound up about someone else not doing something the “right” way, I’m focusing on their shortcomings instead of something in my own life that needs improvement just as urgently. Consider turning your attention to yourself, and being as clear and honest about what you see as you wish your boyfriend would be with the ER doctors.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavgxoey001n3b77wxfdiuu4@published"&gt;Openly LGBTQ+ people are not common in my culture. I have a friend who’s from the same background as me. The thing is, I’m pretty sure he likes guys. I don’t know if there’s anyone in his life he’s opened up to about this, but I want to somehow let him know I’d be a safe person to talk to. I don’t feel like I can just ask him, as it isn’t really anyone’s business if he’s not ready to share. But it hurts to imagine that he may be suffering in silence.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="74" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavgxoez001o3b775lisdafb@published"&gt;Sometimes when he says something disparaging about LGBTQ+ people, I’ll gently push back with something along the lines of “being LGBTQ+ is not the end of the world.” But I’m afraid if I were to push back any harder than that, or if I hint too much about what I suspect, I could scare him away. Sadly, I feel like there’s absolutely nothing I can do until he decides he’s ready. Am I right?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavgxoez001r3b77bjspxusb@published"&gt;I think you could take a harder stance than saying it’s “not the end of the world.” What about something like, “Are you serious? It’s 2025!”; “Maybe it makes me a bad [member of whatever community you’re a part of] but I’m all for people dating/loving/being attracted to/sleeping with whoever they want”; or, “I know that’s what we learned growing up but I just can’t get on board with it.” And if you’re “out” as an ally, you could use what you post and share on social media to signal that you’re not homophobic, and are not OK with LGBTQ+ people being discriminated against or otherwise mistreated.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="117" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmavh27m600353b77dj4yz99q@published"&gt;In addition, work on giving off accepting energy in other ways, which means making sure that in your everyday conversations, you’re not being too critical of anyone. Be gentle with your friend if he comes to you with less controversial admissions—like if he misses the deadline to file his taxes, doesn’t get into dental school, or tells you he has social anxiety. Make sure you encourage him to be kind to himself, normalize what he’s going through, and remind him how highly you think of him. Hopefully, if the day comes that he’s wondering, “Who could I talk to about liking guys?” you’ll pop up in his mind as someone who’s always been an open-minded, non-judgmental friend.&lt;/p&gt;

But they keep bugging me about it, and I would like to be able to eat lunch without constant questions. How do I ward people off and get them to have some patience? (I suppose patience is not really a trait teenagers are known for, but still.)&lt;/p&gt;

Maybe said teacher can even hint that there will be consequences for everyone in the elective if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; share too soon. Then show up at lunch armed with more interesting conversation &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;topics.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

At a school event I bumped into an attractive woman whom I didn’t recognize. She came by and asked if I remember her. It turns out that she was someone I bullied in high school. After that day I noticed other moms slowly avoiding me. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/12/dear-prudie-woman-bullied-high-school-revenge-sons.html"&gt;I think she must have told them about how I used to bully her…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

He reported that the pain had erupted immediately after he'd stifled a sneeze by pinching his nose and closing his mouth at the same time. He was driving and contending with &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/46015-hay-fever.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/46015-hay-fever.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hay fever&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; symptoms when he stifled the sneeze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the man didn't have any trouble breathing, swallowing or talking, his doctors noticed a faint crackling sound during an initial examination of his neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened next: &lt;/strong&gt;When&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the doctors took an X-ray to investigate further, they found signs of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://radiopaedia.org/articles/subcutaneous-emphysema?lang=gb" target="_blank" data-url="https://radiopaedia.org/articles/subcutaneous-emphysema?lang=gb" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;surgical emphysema&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a condition in which air gets trapped under the deepest tissue layers below the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;A CT scan then showed that a tear had formed between the third and fourth bones in the patient's neck, which enabled air to escape from his windpipe, or trachea, and into tissues of the neck and the space between the lungs. The hole in his trachea measured 0.08 by 0.08 inches (2 by 2 millimeters).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctors concluded that the tear likely formed due to a "rapid build-up of pressure in the trachea while sneezing with a pinched nose and closed mouth," according to a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://casereports.bmj.com/content/16/12/e255633" target="_blank" data-url="https://casereports.bmj.com/content/16/12/e255633" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;report of the case&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;The patient's medical providers determined that he didn't need surgery to repair the tear. Instead, they monitored him in the hospital for two days, carefully watching his oxygen levels and other vital signs and not providing food by mouth for the first day. He was then discharged with prescriptions for pain-relief and hay fever medications, as well as doctor's orders to avoid strenuous activity for two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-oGJnXHinYzeqiecYmVJnhm" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-oGJnXHinYzeqiecYmVJnhm slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a checkup five weeks later, a CT scan of the man's neck showed that the tear had completely healed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;Spontaneous windpipe tears aren't widely reported in the medical literature, with only &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.resuscitationjournal.com/article/S0300-9572(06)00659-9/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.resuscitationjournal.com/article/S0300-9572(06)00659-9/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.annalsthoracicsurgery.org/article/S0003-4975(13)00623-1/fulltext" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.annalsthoracicsurgery.org/article/S0003-4975(13)00623-1/fulltext" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;few&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://casereports.bmj.com/content/2017/bcr-2017-220731" target="_blank" data-url="https://casereports.bmj.com/content/2017/bcr-2017-220731" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cases&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; documented prior to this case.

I'd just been for a mid-winter run in a frozen park in the Finnish city of Oulu. The air temperature was -15C (5F). At 170km (106m) south of the Arctic Circle, this is the world's northernmost &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80r3myl990o" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;Parkrun&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Less than an hour later, I ducked into a sauna – a dimly-lit wooden room where intense heat was radiating from a massive wood-burning stove. The thermometer read 85C (185F).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;As I sat there, sweating like crazy, a fellow sauna-goer threw a ladleful of water onto the stove's hot stones to make "löyly" – Finnish for a sudden burst of steam that surges through the air. It's a powerful sensation, almost shocking. The heat reached deep into my skin and muscles, melting away any tension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But that wasn't enough for me. Stepping outside into the cold air, steam rose from my body, and I clambered down an ice-encrusted ladder into the excruciatingly cold water of the Oulu River, which had a temperature of around 1C (34F). I felt piercing pain, like a million needles striking my skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But I didn't jump out. Instead, I counted slowly up to 12. And after a few seconds the pain seemd to disappear – I actually felt okay with it. It was almost like an icy hug. When I clambered out, the air around me seemed almost warm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;To some, it might sound like the morning schedule of a deranged masochist. But this sequence of cold, hot and then cold again made me feel strangely alive. A sauna followed by an ice bath is known as &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40094855/" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;contrast therapy&lt;/a&gt; in sports medicine – and it feels surprisingly good. When I do it, I experience a rush of energy, which gives way to a mood of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;To those outside of Finland the lurch from cold, to hot and to cold again can seem extreme, but it is a &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxz0vw9k6go" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;health craze&lt;/a&gt; that is now spreading beyond Scandinavian borders to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0531556521002916" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;other parts of the world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;So I wanted to delve into the science behind the Finnish sauna and find out whether it really is good for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 hoQmHM"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-4abb68ca-1 eOgpjw"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20250508-105310-2a3fc0651-web-2.21.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 itgEAh hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0lcdy9k.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0lcdy9k.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0lcdy9k.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lcdy9k.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0lcdy9k.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0lcdy9k.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0lcdy9k.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0lcdy9k.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0lcdy9k.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0lcdy9k.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Antti Leinonen Erika Benke, the author of this article, has been enjoying saunas combined with ice plunges for years (Credit: Antti Leinonen)" class="sc-4abb68ca-0 ldLcJe"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-4abb68ca-2 kkAKIJ"&gt;Antti Leinonen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jvncPH"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1b6a1475-0 feHvAW"&gt;Erika Benke, the author of this article, has been enjoying saunas combined with ice plunges for years (Credit: Antti Leinonen)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Finns go to the sauna at least once a week and spend between five to 30 minutes in about 80–100C (176-212F) heat," says Heikki Junkkari, a doctor who sits on the board of the Finnish Sauna Society, an organisation that has promoted Finnish sauna culture since 1937.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;There are an estimated &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-43414145" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;3.3 million saunas&lt;/a&gt;  in this country of 5.5 million people, meaning they are accessible to almost everyone.

Men who took part in two to three sauna sessions a week had a 20% lower risk of Alzheimer's disease and 22% lower risk of dementia than those who only took one weekly sauna. The effect was enhanced the more frequent the sauna use was, with a 66% reduction in dementia and 65% in Alzheimer's disease among those who used a sauna between four and seven times per week, compared with those who only used the sauna once per week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The study did not, however, compare the effects of a sauna against the risk in men who did not use saunas at all and so the results may also reflect something more generally about the lifestyles of people who have time to indulge in sauna bathing in the first place.  It is also worth remembering such observational results do not necessarily mean a direct cause and effect relationship between saunas and dementia. Instead it provides a glimpse at an effect that warrants further research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-2b8ea91d-0 bgzaEJ"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-2b8ea91d-2 dYxeIv"&gt;Sauna played a key role helping us find peace, giving rhythm to our lives – Juha Mieto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Anecdotal reports of psychological benefits associated with sauna use include that of Juha Mieto, a well-known Finnish cross-country skier.

"Sauna is a space where our norms and conventions are temporarily suspended – we take off our clothes, sit in close proximity, and endure extremes together," she says. "These are great, ritual environments for our identities to transform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Sauna therapist Laura Foon says the warm, calm atmosphere induces a sense of relaxation. "Today, we're constantly on high alert," she says. "Diving into soothing darkness in the sauna is profoundly healing." It is like returning to the womb, she suggests. The sauna is a reassuringly safe space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;But what about when you skip out of the sauna and plunge yourself into a lake shrouded in ice?

&lt;p class="block"&gt;Last Thursday, May 15, Sachem High School East Principal Lou Antonetti sent a letter home to the 123 people who the district believed had extended contact with the infected individual who had an active case of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;"We are contacting you because we have reason to believe that you had contact with this individual during the time (s)he was infectious," Antonetti wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;On Monday, May 19, the district provided a free skin test to those potentially exposed. The district also offered the option for students and staff to go to their doctors for testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;A Suffolk County Health Department spokesperson said the agency could not disclose how many of the 123 people were tested at the school versus privately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;“It was only one student anyway that had it, and everybody is being tested, so I’m not worried about it," Holtsville resident Lisa Russo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Others said they were concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;"What's being done to ensure the safety of the kids when we, as parents or guardians, send them to school?" Farmingville resident Janie Gallo asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;The tests take two days to show results. According to district officials, the test results will be evaluated at the high school today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Testing will be done again in July after a 2-month incubation period has elapsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;Tuberculosis is a potentially serious infectious disease caused by bacteria. It primarily affects the lungs and causes a persistent cough and chest pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;The bacteria are easily spread through the air when actively sick people cough, sneeze or speak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;“I’ve had TB before, so you can fight it," Farmingville resident Anton Kovary said. "You can overcome any kind of disease you have.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="block"&gt;According to the state health department, there were 1,089 total statewide tuberculosis cases last year, including 48 in Nassau County and 52 in Suffolk County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>News 12</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 09:12:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiowFBVV95cUxQTlVUemFVajRKTWlFT0hmYlhJTC04d2N3ZTVEQVpEbWlSN001Y2JVUTMxSGgyUzNkdHR1eVZyb2Y2V2NEN0pxSkZVS09jcFM2Y1VrY1BoYW1LVmc1cWhtWHFRQl9ZaEpLcmNBRDBVOUdGOURCUmM1QktKbnNHeVRFdlJpdC1nTU9XWG1tdTVIR2ZxLUlTTTJDN183N2llTWpFM2NR</guid></item><item><title>德克萨斯州的父母通过加大疫苗接种力度来对抗麻疹疫情- NBC新闻 | A surge of Texas parents fought measles outbreak by stepping up vaccine effort - NBC News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNZVpzR25JZWdJN2lITS1nWEgxTWZGRi1VZTlfRURiVDlZNGo1ZnBtdm0tazNkRDdJemtCXzM2UFZNRDNobTF1cDZueW1rdDFOYmlWcV9SaThTendXRGRiT29ta3F3azlUS2hxNHhTUFZsU0lRbEhaYXRHWkVwYTU0cnJSSWViLVlTS3JtRW4xNklrMUZtdk52VlJDR0UtU2E1TUxIVkFvZk1Td9IBVkFVX3lxTFBPc1VkRHQwX01fUzZoLTM2QWVZeGprc1pHVHN0NW9aUUk1Z2ZDTm5LNDF4T0pEMXVMcjY1UDd2SE1sako3VWR4UENvdUQwTnlPSk85dVB3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body__content"&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Kala Hunter did not hesitate to get her 2-year-old son, Brady, fully vaccinated in March as the number of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/measles-outbreak-west-texas-grows-unvaccinated-rcna192163" target="_blank"&gt;measles cases grew&lt;/a&gt; in her West Texas community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Being in the hotbed of the measles outbreak,” said Hunter, 47, of Lubbock, “it was a no-brainer.

Neither kid has had side effects like fever or rash from the shot, Hunter and Montes said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.truveta.com/blog/research/research-insights/2025-early-measles-vaccinations-in-texas/" target="_blank"&gt;New data from Truveta&lt;/a&gt;, a health care and analytics company, shows that the percentage of 6-month-old babies in Texas getting their measles vaccination in April increased by more than 30 times the prior year’s average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“That means parents aren’t just getting the vaccine early, they’re getting it as early as they can,” Nina Masters, a senior scientist at Truveta and part of the research team, said in an interview with NBC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Typically, the MMR is given in two doses, around a child’s first birthday, and again around the time a child enters kindergarten, at age 4 or 5. One dose is 93% effective at preventing measles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A second dose increases protection to 97%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;During measles outbreaks, however, the first dose can be given as early as 6 months old. If a child has already received the first dose at 12 months, doctors can give the second dose about a month later, said Dr. Ronald Cook, chief health officer at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock and health authority for the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Public health measures, which include vaccinations, stop the spread of the virus, even in areas with outbreaks of measles,” Cook said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Most of the time, fewer than 2% of infants get vaccinated early for measles, according to the Truveta data. The company used its access to electronic health record information for tens of thousands of infants in Texas to assess early vaccination uptake in the state. That low percentage isn’t surprising as the shots aren’t generally given early unless there’s an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The data shows that early vaccinations of Texan infants 6 to 11 months old ticked up in February as word of the outbreak spread. The number increased even more in March, and by April, it was exponentially higher than vaccination percentages before the outbreak began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 09:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqgFBVV95cUxNZVpzR25JZWdJN2lITS1nWEgxTWZGRi1VZTlfRURiVDlZNGo1ZnBtdm0tazNkRDdJemtCXzM2UFZNRDNobTF1cDZueW1rdDFOYmlWcV9SaThTendXRGRiT29ta3F3azlUS2hxNHhTUFZsU0lRbEhaYXRHWkVwYTU0cnJSSWViLVlTS3JtRW4xNklrMUZtdk52VlJDR0UtU2E1TUxIVkFvZk1Td9IBVkFVX3lxTFBPc1VkRHQwX01fUzZoLTM2QWVZeGprc1pHVHN0NW9aUUk1Z2ZDTm5LNDF4T0pEMXVMcjY1UDd2SE1sako3VWR4UENvdUQwTnlPSk85dVB3</guid></item><item><title>疾病正在蔓延。疾病预防控制中心没有像几个月前那样向公众发出警告- NPR | Diseases are spreading.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;To accomplish its mission of increasing the health security of the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/about/cdc/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; that it "conducts critical science and provides health information" to protect the nation. But since President Trump's administration assumed power in January, many of the platforms the CDC used to communicate with the public have gone silent, an NPR analysis found.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Many of the CDC's newsletters have stopped being distributed, workers at the CDC say. Health alerts about disease outbreaks, previously sent to health professionals subscribed to the CDC's Health Alert Network, haven't been dispatched &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/php/about/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fhan%2Findex.html" target="_blank"&gt;since March&lt;/a&gt;. The agency's main social media channels have come under new ownership of the Department of Health and Human Services, emails reviewed by NPR show, and most have gone more than a month without posting their own new content.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"Public health functions best when its experts are allowed to communicate the work that they do in real time, and that's not happening," said Kevin Griffis, who served as the director of communications at the CDC until March. "That could put people's lives at risk."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Health emergencies have not paused since January. Cases of measles, salmonella, listeria and hepatitis A and C have spread throughout the country. More than 100 million Americans continue to suffer from chronic diseases like diabetes and breast cancer. The decline in the agency's communication could put people at risk, said four current and former CDC workers, three of whom NPR is allowing to remain anonymous because they are still employed by the CDC and believe they may be punished for speaking out.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-67861" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"We are functionally unable to operate communications," said one of the CDC workers. "We feel like our hands are tied behind our backs."&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;Before Trump was inaugurated, the CDC managed most of its communication. HHS, the agency that oversees the CDC and more than 20 divisions and agencies, rarely reviewed the content in CDC social media posts or newsletters, CDC workers said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;That allowed the CDC to communicate quickly and often.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The whole goal is to say, this is what we know. And here are the best recommendations from experts in the field," said Dr. Jodie Guest, a professor and senior vice chair of the Department of Epidemiology at Emory University's Rollins School of Public Health. "And this is the best advice about the way the general population should handle things in order to protect their health."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The CDC's communication staff dispersed health messages weekly, monthly and quarterly through a network of more than 150 &lt;a href="https://tools.cdc.gov/campaignproxyservice/subscriptions.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;newsletters&lt;/a&gt; about topics like arthritis, diabetes and food safety. The CDC distributed those newsletters to tens of thousands of subscribers, CDC employees said, including clinicians and laboratories that relied on the information to care for patients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Facts from those dispatches were often shared on social media. Information from the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the agency's publication of public health information and recommendations, was regularly posted across the CDC's main social platforms, like on Facebook and X, formerly Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Scientists and other communication professionals at the CDC could also suggest other health facts to be posted on the agency's main platforms. Those sorts of posts included information on X about topics like how COVID-19 was &lt;a href="https://x.com/CDCgov/status/1253089647317725186" target="_blank"&gt;spreading in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, posts on Facebook about &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/cdc/posts/pfbid02bwr2gcCRGCKhWtbrvZBeohvWWCWXWpexyVzdkT6GHwXUaxTyswh9KGV2m4RBAFsvl" target="_blank"&gt;how to prevent bacterial infections &lt;/a&gt;and posts across platforms about how to get screened for chronic illnesses, like cancers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The messages quickly reached a wide audience. More than 12 million people subscribe to the CDC's main Facebook, Instagram, X and LinkedIn accounts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"&lt;/strong&gt;Social media is one of the main ways the CDC communicates plain language, life-saving messages to America," said one CDC employee.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But now, many of those messages have stopped being sent out. Changes to communication at the CDC began shortly after Trump was inaugurated in January, when HHS instructed the CDC and other health agencies to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/24/g-s1-44613/cdc-nih-hhs-health-data-mmwr" target="_blank"&gt;pause&lt;/a&gt; any sort of collaboration with people outside the agency.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"So at that point we stopped pretty much all communications," said a CDC employee who works at the agency.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The pause affected some of the CDC's most essential publications. The CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the agency's regularly published write-up of important new public health research and disease outbreak information, was not released for two weeks after Trump was inaugurated. No report was published on Jan. 23, the first Friday after the inauguration, or on Jan. 30, the second Friday.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The unprecedented break in publication of the weekly reports concerned some subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It stopped publishing at the height of the bird flu outbreak and at the beginning of the measles outbreak," said Guest, the epidemiology professor at Emory, who said she's been reading the report every week since she was a graduate student. "And so it's really a time when we want to get that very consistent and very important and scientifically sound information, and it was all shut down."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/mmwr_additional_resources.html#cc-widget-8f0c" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; resumed on Friday Feb. 6, around the time workers at the CDC were told they could resume some meetings with external partners, CDC employees said. But the way the facts inside have been shared with the public has not returned to how it was. Communications have not been handled in-house by CDC scientists and communicators like before. All posts that CDC workers want to make to their agency's social media accounts have to be reviewed by HHS, employees at the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What we're being told is that, no, your channels aren't going to go back." said a CDC employee.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;On April 24, some employees were sent an email from a supervisor that confirmed that HHS now owned the CDC's main social media platforms, including its X, Instagram, LinkedIn and Facebook accounts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We were also notified that HHS is not accepting content for those channels at this time," the email added.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In response to a request for comment regarding the changes to communication practices at the CDC, the director of  communications at HHS, Andrew Nixon, cast doubt on what the workers said. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's unfortunate to see career officials spreading false rumors," Nixon replied. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since HHS approval was instituted as a requirement for posting, almost no newsletters have been sent to the tens of thousands of people who subscribe to them, CDC workers said. The &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/han/php/about/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fhan%2Findex.html" target="_blank"&gt;last update&lt;/a&gt; sent out by the CDC's Health Alert Network was regarding the risk of dengue infection on March 18, even though outbreaks of salmonella and listeria were &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/outbreaks/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; in May by the CDC on its website.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;When CDC publications have gone out, some have been delayed or missing information. A recent release of CDC data regarding the prevalence of HIV in the U.S. cautioned that it "does not include data on PrEP coverage," referring to medication taken by individuals to prevent HIV infection. "CDC is unable to resume PrEP coverage at this time, due to a reduction in force affecting the Division of HIV Prevention (DHP)."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Two CDC employees who work in communications told NPR that fewer than half of the public health posts they've sent to HHS for approval have been cleared for publication on social media. Even posts that include basic information about recent disease outbreaks, like the number of people sickened or hospitalized, have not been posted as requested by employees, NPR confirmed after reviewing posts submitted for approval by an employee. Communications workers say they are also suggesting fewer health posts because they anticipate that their posts will be rejected.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Everything is getting bottlenecked at the top," said a worker. "It is extraordinarily time-consuming and backlogs us by weeks, if not months."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The consequences could be deadly, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"When you have an outbreak of something like listeria, if you are a person who is pregnant and you consume food items that might have listeria in it that CDC should be warning you about, you run the risk of the baby that you are carrying dying," said Guest. "And so that information needs to get out there."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;"Propaganda" instead of public health&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On April 1, thousands of federal health workers were laid off as part of the government's "reduction in force." Communication professionals at the CDC were not spared. Almost everyone at the CDC whose primary job was to communicate with the press was laid off, in addition to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/04/03/g-s1-57888/hhs-fda-rfk-foia-public-records" target="_blank"&gt;almost everyone&lt;/a&gt; whose job it was to provide records to the public. Every member of the CDC's division of digital media was also told their jobs would be eliminated, workers at the CDC said.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"All the points of contact that we generally rely on to communicate with the American people have either been eliminated or dramatically reduced," said Griffis, the former CDC communications director.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Removing all the CDC's web developers, graphic designers and social media staffers simultaneously caused a problem. The CDC was suddenly locked out of its main social media accounts, said three people close to the situation.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The passwords to those accounts were kept on a password protected Word doc," said one worker at the CDC. "And that Word doc was inaccessible for anyone left, because all of the people that could have opened that document were fired."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Most of the main accounts haven't posted since the CDC's digital media team was laid off. During March, the CDC's &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/cdc/" target="_blank"&gt;main Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; posted more than 20 times—sometimes twice a day. The posts included information for pregnant women about how to take care of their developing babies and screenings for colorectal cancer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p id="resnx-s1-5387723-102" class="bucketwrap statichtml"&gt;
            
   &lt;/p&gt;
   

   &lt;p&gt;The only main CDC account that has posted some content since April 1 is the CDC's account on X, a platform owned by Elon Musk. He oversaw the Department of Government Efficiency, the organization that spearheaded efforts to lay off tens of thousands of workers across federal agencies.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On April 7, workers at the CDC said they were surprised to see the CDC's main X account post a tweet for the first time in a week.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p id="resnx-s1-5387723-103" class="bucketwrap statichtml"&gt;
             
   &lt;/p&gt;
   

   &lt;p&gt;"Secretary Kennedy's directive is for CDC to lead the nation in health readiness and response," the post stated, sharing a message from Kennedy's own X account about his visit to Gaines County, Texas. "His visit to Texas Sunday, to support the state's efforts to control the measles outbreak, resulted in discussions with Texas state health officials to deploy another CDC response team to the area to further assist with the state's efforts to protect its citizens against measles and its complications."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-67863" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;No one they knew had drafted the message, the CDC employees said. Compared to the science and health information that had traditionally been posted to the accounts, three of the current workers at the CDC that NPR spoke with said they considered the post about Kennedy to be akin to "propaganda."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Griffis, the former communications director, said there's nothing wrong with retweeting a cabinet secretary.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What's undermines the credibility of CDC communications moving forward is the near cessation of pro-vaccination and apolitical public health messages in favor of messages that amplify the secretary," he said. "That makes it a political channel."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Since posting about Kennedy's visit to Texas in early April, the CDC's main X account has re-posted two more tweets from Kennedy's account and re-posted one tweet from the HHS X account, which contradicted a CBS News story. On May 14, the account posted about a recent decline in overdose deaths. By comparison, during the month of April last year, in 2024, the CDC's main X account posted more than 90 times, offering advice and information about topics like alcohol use, a salmonella outbreak, COVID-19 vaccines and wastewater surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The director of communications at HHS confirmed that the CDC is not locked out of its X account.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"The CDC has access to their X account - it's that simple," Nixon said. "CDC is an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and supports Secretary Kennedy's vision to protect public health and Make America Healthy Again."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Nixon did not respond to a request for comment regarding whether the CDC was still locked out of its other main social media accounts.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="hr"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to share information regarding public health or other topics, you can send an email to the reporter of this article at eisnerchiara@proton.me.

&lt;p&gt;Here on the Tom’s Guide fitness desk, we love nothing more than a walking trend — from &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-60-minutes-of-silent-walking-every-day-for-one-week-heres-how-it-helped-boost-my-mental-stamina" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/fitness/i-tried-60-minutes-of-silent-walking-every-day-for-one-week-heres-how-it-helped-boost-my-mental-stamina"&gt;silent walking&lt;/a&gt; to the viral &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/12-3-30-treadmill-workout" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/12-3-30-treadmill-workout"&gt;12-3-30 workout&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve tried them all. The latest trend in walking? The Japanese Interval Walking Training (IWT), which promises to burn more fat and lower your blood pressure. To find out more, I grabbed a comfy pair of sneakers, one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html"&gt;best fitness trackers,&lt;/a&gt; and gave it a go. Read on to find out what happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-japanese-interval-walking-method-3"&gt;What is the Japanese interval walking method?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interval walking method originated in Japan, and is a form of HIIT training. As its name suggests, you alternate your pace throughout. Here’s how to do it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Set a timer on your watch or phone and walk for three minutes at a low intensity. This should be a 4/10 effort — you’re still moving, but you should easily be able to hold a conversation with someone next to you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then walk three minutes at a high intensity. This is a 7/10 walking effort — you should be working hard.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep switching between paces for 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-benefits-3"&gt;What are the benefits?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up until now, we’ve been told that 10,000 steps a day is the holy grail to aim for when it comes to walking, but is the IWT method better for you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there’s no right or wrong when it comes to adding more steps to your day, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17605959/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17605959/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;studies&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have found IWT has several health benefits. After three months of doing a 30-minute interval walk three times a week, participants had a lower blood pressure and cholesterol, increased leg strength, and more aerobic capacity than those who walked continuously at a moderate pace for the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re also likely to burn more calories walking intervals, as by nature, you’ll increase your heart rate during the faster-paced minutes. If walking for weight loss is your goal, remember you’ll need to be in a calorie deficit, burning more calories than you consume. One easy way to track this is to strap one of the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/best-fitness-trackers,review-2066.html"&gt;best fitness trackers&lt;/a&gt; to your wrist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="i-gave-japanese-interval-walking-training-a-go-here-s-what-happened-3"&gt;I gave Japanese Interval Walking Training a go — here’s what happened &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To find out more, I gave this method a go on my daily walks for a week. Here’s how I got on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ZBXTUcLUCBbRCP6FESBk6X" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-ZBXTUcLUCBbRCP6FESBk6X slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-i-was-instantly-hooked"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was instantly hooked &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This method immediately took me back to speed sessions on the track, and I loved it. I loved pushing myself during the faster-paced intervals, then slowing down and catching my breath before going again. Unlike other walking workouts, you jump straight into this one, meaning you’re getting your heart rate pumping almost straight away — perfect if you’re short on time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I walk every morning, and have done so for years, and this was a great way to mix things up. I noticed my heart rate was higher than it would be on my normal morning walk, although I admit I tend to stroll along with a coffee, not power down the street with purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the faster intervals, I had to think about my form — keeping my core engaged, my torso up, and my arms swinging in time with my legs. This helped me maintain pace, albeit to the amusement of my fellow dog walkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Shutterstock)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-i-had-to-rewind-my-audiobook-several-times"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I had to rewind my audiobook several times &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I confess, I struggle to do two things at once. On the first day of this challenge, I used the timer on my phone and missed chapters of my audiobook as I watched the minutes tick by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, I set up the challenge as a custom workout on my &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/smartwatches/apple-watch-series-10-review" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/smartwatches/apple-watch-series-10-review"&gt;Apple Watch 10&lt;/a&gt;. The watches buzzed every time I needed to change pace, allowing me to leave my phone in my pocket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-it-s-not-one-to-do-with-a-toddler"&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s not one to do with a toddler &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two mornings a week, when he’s not in nursery, my toddler joins me on my morning walk. Sometimes in the sling, other times in his stroller. The extra resistance of carrying or pushing my baby made this a real workout and left me sweating. New levels of mom strength unlocked, and all before 9 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"&gt;&lt;span&gt;My verdict &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for a way to mix up your daily walk, increase your fat burn, and reap several health benefits, give Interval Walking Training a go. I loved it, and while I won’t be committing to it seven mornings a week (I’ll admit, I missed my chilled, meditative walks too much), I’ll be sure to keep this up a couple of times a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a runner, I use my walks as a form of active recovery, but this was a great way to work on my cardiovascular endurance, without the impact of running. Plus, it was done in 30 minutes. If fitting long workouts into your routine feels overwhelming, this can be done with no equipment, on your lunch break, in your local park. No excuses — what are you waiting for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-more-from-tom-s-guide"&gt;&lt;span&gt;More from Tom's Guide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;aside data-model-name="Apple Watch Series 10" data-widget-type="multimodelreview" data-render-type="editorial" class="hawk-base"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-multi-model-review-container"&gt;&lt;div class="hawk-multi-model-review-retail-container"&gt;&lt;p class="hawk-title-container"&gt;Today's best Apple Watch Series 10 deals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

She lives alone and insists she’s “just fine,” but I can see she’s slipping -- physically, mentally and emotionally. She has high blood pressure, diabetes and serious arthritis, but she won’t stay on her medications. She hasn’t been to a primary care doctor in over five years. She flat-out refuses cancer screenings or even basic lab work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-2" data-gaid="inarticle-2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="OQE2TOQXWNFG7HLMMPXJBQLLJI"&gt; Lately, I’ve noticed what could be signs of early dementia -- getting lost on familiar roads, forgetting appointments, struggling to follow conversations. I finally got her to see a neurologist last fall, and they recommended a brain scan and further testing. She never followed through. Now she’s barely leaving the house and won’t let me bring in any outside help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-3" data-gaid="inarticle-3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EQZOMK2WZJBCPI62TJWYSI23ZY"&gt; I’ve tried small changes to keep her safe -- grab bars in the bathroom, meal deliveries, even offering to go with her to doctor appointments. Every single time, she shuts me down with, “Don’t start” or, “I’m not an invalid.” She’s isolating more and her mobility is getting worse. I’m scared she’s going to fall or end up in the ER with something that could’ve been managed earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-4" data-gaid="inarticle-4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="AE5LLV5IZFBT7OVIHNZ3OFOO54"&gt; How do I respect her independence while also not sitting back and watching her decline? -- Worried and Worn Out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-5" data-gaid="inarticle-5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZTAMB7ZJVZGNXBGBMQWMROQF3M"&gt;&lt;b&gt; Dear Worried:&lt;/b&gt; You are carrying a heavy burden, and I commend your patience and devotion. But here’s the hard truth: You can bring a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink. No matter how much you care or how hard you try, you cannot force your mother to seek help if she refuses it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-6" class="middleParagraph" data-gaid="inarticle-6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="ZKTO75QF2RHHFDP5WSGIOJFL6U"&gt; What you can do is focus on safety. Make the home as secure and fall-proof as possible. Consider a home health consultation or speak with her primary care physician about ways to support her from a distance. And for your own well-being, talk to a counselor or support group for caregivers. You need support, too. Loving her the best you can is enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-7" data-gaid="inarticle-7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="JZG3V5MOCFHEDDKMUBPGDO5EBY"&gt;Send your questions for Annie Lane to dearannie@creators.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-8" data-gaid="inarticle-8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="EBYHIOLEVJHGZJVGXHCIVR7HLQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-9" data-gaid="inarticle-9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="G5SLRHG7Z5G4HDU77M4Q2RHISY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-10" data-gaid="inarticle-10"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="2UEMV3EN5RH3DMTGZPQLTUFKDE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-11" data-gaid="inarticle-11"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-enter:KZYFEFL5HNG47PTDYUQYICYD7M" data-fusion-component="KZYFEFL5HNG47PTDYUQYICYD7M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="fusion-static-exit:KZYFEFL5HNG47PTDYUQYICYD7M" data-fusion-component="KZYFEFL5HNG47PTDYUQYICYD7M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-12" data-gaid="inarticle-12"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>MLive.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 07:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinwFBVV95cUxOVE5ranRfLUZDb1Ntb3VydDdpT1N3SUVoUFhhRnNOcGN5X0RvYjQweTZIUmJmbFBsM0plSnRBckMyYXRzQmU0M0hldHQweDV5eEtUdWZJSnRpSmpmcks2TG9vMEtkS09mQk9VWnJZWnlLOHg0OTkyQ2JxMFlZNlp1R3EwSS1LQVdqUlhPZWdGbmhvZGVYSFdnSkJSM1ZxSmvSAbMBQVVfeXFMT2o2XzJpaUtRYl9BNkhTTGRhU01hYkZ4Z2FyX0NMWUJpLXRGSzhIVFIxdzNVT0N3MDR2eWo3dEp5M2hDd0VweV9Kc2NNbTFaRXY1ZFBlbmxCQzVmM0hTNDZLZHlFNWM0TGo3LVRDc3ZGRTZSNl9QLUxQQ3o1d0VuSTlNYzJEVFdabVlfOHZRZHAxZ3RMeFVaQlA2Uk1NNlZaMFZ1VWZJVkQ0NTVfeTJ4V0NQSEE</guid></item><item><title>首个单一患者基因编辑药物拯救婴儿- NewsForKids.net | Baby Saved by First Single-Patient Gene-Editing Medicine - NewsForKids.net</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiowFBVV95cUxOOGw0SmNPRm5pOGpxR2F4YVRuZWsxNFVnOW1tYTZFLUhpZEhkb2JWWklKMnlndTAtTF9hWTI2UHRDc3liNG0xNmJYVEhsMEczMnYxNkNRVUh0SFBiWnd1cVg5RTBjUWZ5QVNuTlBmMU5iVFJXUnd2UWxLS25OZS1ta1FxMF84a0xGeXdOUElHTlNHQ19lQnZySFp5R0JTU2FoLU5Z?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;

The patient – a young baby who was sick because of a problem with his &lt;span class="nfkd" title="DNA is a collection of information and instructions stored in a tiny chemical form. Every living thing has DNA that causes it to grow in a certain way." rel="tooltip"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; – is now greatly improved, and is expected to go home soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after he was born, doctors knew that KJ Muldoon was struggling. Test showed that KJ’s DNA had a mistake which made it hard for his body to get rid of a dangerous chemical called ammonia. Too much ammonia can damage the brain and other organs. Roughly half of the children born with this problem die while they’re still babies.&lt;/p&gt;

Test showed that KJ’s DNA had a mistake which made it hard for his body to get rid of a dangerous chemical called ammonia. Above, KJ at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.&lt;br&gt;(Source: &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/worlds-first-patient-treated-personalized-crispr-gene-editing-therapy-childrens-hospital" target="_blank"&gt;CHOP&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the human body digests proteins, it creates ammonia. In a healthy person, the liver helps get rid of this ammonia. But because of the problem with his &lt;span class="nfkd" title="Genes are small bits of DNA which work to control different parts of how a living thing grows. For example, a person's eye color depends on their genes." rel="tooltip"&gt;genes&lt;/span&gt;, KJ’s liver couldn’t get rid of ammonia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KJ was too young and small for a liver &lt;span class="nfkd" title="Transplanting means replacing an organ (like the heart or kidneys) which has serious problems with a healthy one. Surgery to give someone a transplant is called transplantation." rel="tooltip"&gt;transplant&lt;/span&gt;, and waiting for a transplant would have been very dangerous. Doctors at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) asked KJ’s parents if they wanted to try a brand new method – a special medicine made just for KJ. His parent said yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editing DNA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;     DNA is a collection of information and instructions stored in a tiny chemical form. DNA tells cells, the building blocks of a body, what to do. Every living thing has DNA that causes it to grow in a certain way.&lt;br&gt;     Small bits of DNA, called “genes”, help control different parts of how a living thing grows. For example, some genes might control eye color. Some genes work by themselves, others work together. Some may help control more than one thing.&lt;br&gt;     In recent years, scientists have made great progress in their ability to “edit” DNA. CRISPR is a tool that allows scientists to cut out or change a piece of DNA. Editing DNA is tricky and complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scientists at Penn Medicine had been working on the idea of creating medicines to fix the genes of a single patient. Now they had a chance to really  try it. But the pressure was on, since there wasn’t much time to help KJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers studied KJ’s DNA. The problem was like fixing one misspelled letter in a word that’s three billion letters long. With the help of lots of scientists pitching in and working long hours, soon they had developed a CRISPR tool for editing KJ’s DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_25826" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-25826" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://newsforkids.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/chop-n-of-1-gene-editing-asgct-kj-cps1-press-release-2-1200.jpg" alt="A person wearing a lab coat points at a complex image on a computer monitor in a darkened room." class="size-medium wp-image-25826" srcset="https://newsforkids.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/chop-n-of-1-gene-editing-asgct-kj-cps1-press-release-2-1200.webp 1280w, https://newsforkids.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/chop-n-of-1-gene-editing-asgct-kj-cps1-press-release-2-1200-500x300.webp 500w, https://newsforkids.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/chop-n-of-1-gene-editing-asgct-kj-cps1-press-release-2-1200-1024x614.webp 1024w, https://newsforkids.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/chop-n-of-1-gene-editing-asgct-kj-cps1-press-release-2-1200-200x120.webp 200w, https://newsforkids.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/chop-n-of-1-gene-editing-asgct-kj-cps1-press-release-2-1200-768x461.webp 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-25826" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Scientists at Penn Medicine had been working on creating medicines to fix the genes of a single patient.

&lt;p&gt;Next, they tested the new medicine on mice and monkeys. The results were positive – the new treatment helped the animals and appeared safe. After just six months, the new medicine was approved by the &lt;span class="nfkd" title="The FDA (Food and Drug Administration) is the US government agency that oversees the safety of food, drugs, and medical products." rel="tooltip"&gt;FDA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this time, KJ had been getting medicine and special treatment to help lower his ammonia levels. KJ was six months old when he got the first small dose of the new medicine, which was designed to reach his liver and make one tiny change to his DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_25828" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-25828" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://newsforkids.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/chop-stories-kj-patient-story-3-1200.jpg" alt="Two masked doctors in medical gowns with the baby, KJ, in a striped shirt.

Above, Dr. Kiran Musunru (left) and Dr. Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas (right), who led the researchers from CHOP and Penn who created the new medicine for KJ.&lt;br&gt;(Source: &lt;a href="https://www.chop.edu/news/worlds-first-patient-treated-personalized-crispr-gene-editing-therapy-childrens-hospital" target="_blank"&gt;CHOP&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after the first treatment, KJ was able to eat protein without raising his body’s levels of ammonia. The positive results led his doctors to give KJ two more doses. KJ has gained weight and is now much healthier. Soon, the hospital expects him to go home for the first time in his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KJ isn’t completely cured. He may need to keep taking medicine, and one day he may need a liver transplant. But he is in far better shape now than when he was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_25831" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-25831" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://newsforkids.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/chop-stories-kj-patient-story-kj-video-thumbnail.jpg" alt="A smiling young baby looks toward the camera.

&lt;p&gt;Scientists and doctors are extremely excited about the results. In just six months, the researchers and the companies they worked with were able to create a special DNA-editing medicine for a single patient. In the past, that work would have taken 10 years or longer. The project isn’t only a success for KJ. It also brings hope to millions of other people who have conditions that might be treated by similar methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did You Know…?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The treatment for KJ was made possible by &lt;span class="nfkd" title="A decade is ten years." rel="tooltip"&gt;decades&lt;/span&gt; of research paid for by the US government. Fyodor Urnov, one of the scientists involved, said, “I don’t think this could have happened in any country other than the US.” Several of the companies involved helped out for free.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Sitting might be a comfortable and convenient way to spend much of your day, but a new study of older adults suggests it can lead to brain shrinkage and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-identify-4-key-factors-that-may-predict-cognitive-decline"&gt;cognitive issues&lt;/a&gt;, irrespective of how much exercise you're managing to fit in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research counters the idea that periods of sitting &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/study-reveals-the-optimal-number-of-daily-steps-to-offset-sitting-down"&gt;can be balanced out&lt;/a&gt; by periods of being active, at least when it comes to brain health in people aged 50 or above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study researchers, from Vanderbilt University, the University of Pittsburgh, and Seoul National University, think that too much sitting or lying down (known as sedentary behavior) can impact the brain and increase the risk of different types of dementia later in life, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Reducing your risk for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="161777" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease is not just about working out once a day," &lt;a href="https://news.vumc.org/2025/05/13/study-reveals-sedentary-behavior-is-an-independent-risk-factor-for-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Marissa Gogniat, from the University of Pittsburgh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Minimizing the time spent sitting, even if you do exercise daily, reduces the likelihood of developing Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers recruited 404 volunteers, tracking their activity levels with wearables over the course of a week. Then, over the next seven years, cognitive tests and brain scans were used to assess their brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though 87 percent of the volunteers were meeting the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2018.14854"&gt;recommended weekly guidelines&lt;/a&gt; of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, those who sat more overall showed worse cognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also showed more signs of neurodegeneration – including a faster thinning of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocampus"&gt;the hippocampus&lt;/a&gt;, a part of the brain crucial to memory function and one of the first areas to show damage from Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_161780" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-161780" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/SittingChart.jpg" alt="Sitting statistical analysis" class="wp-image-161780 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/SittingChart.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/SittingChart-600x300.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-161780" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The team charted time spent sitting against signs associated with dementia. (Gogniat et al, &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The association wasn't huge, and doesn't prove direct cause and effect, but it was noticeable: spending &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/excessive-sitting-raises-risk-of-early-death-now-we-know-how-much"&gt;more time sitting&lt;/a&gt; seems to age the brain faster, and reducing that amount of time, rather than just exercising more, appears to be the best antidote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stronger associations were found in those already at a higher genetic risk of Alzheimer's, the data shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This research highlights the importance of reducing sitting time, particularly among aging adults at increased genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease," &lt;a href="https://news.vumc.org/2025/05/13/study-reveals-sedentary-behavior-is-an-independent-risk-factor-for-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; neurologist Angela Jefferson, from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is critical to our brain health to take breaks from sitting throughout the day and move around to increase our active time."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, these findings aren't a reason to give up more vigorous exercise. We know that being active does wonders for our physical and mental health, and even small amounts of exercise can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/less-than-30-minutes-of-exercise-does-something-wonderful-for-your-brain"&gt;keep the brain sharp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's most important here is that extra hours sitting down were linked to certain kinds of wear and tear in the brain. This &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-020-0799-5"&gt;isn't the first time&lt;/a&gt; that sedentary behavior has been linked with dementia and Alzheimer's, but it's another important and comprehensive set of data that researchers and health professionals can draw on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is critical to study lifestyle choices and the impact they have on brain health as we age," &lt;a href="https://news.vumc.org/2025/05/13/study-reveals-sedentary-behavior-is-an-independent-risk-factor-for-alzheimers-disease/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Jefferson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70157"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Vaccines undergo rigorous safety testing and are continuously monitored for adverse events. They go through &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/development-approval-process-cber/vaccine-development-101" target="_blank"&gt;several stages&lt;/a&gt; of clinical trials before approval (known as licensure), with thousands of people studied to prove safety and effectiveness before vaccines are cleared for the general public. In addition to extensive preapproval safety testing, vaccines are continuously monitored for any problems — often for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="S7CJMDYMLVDDZL2AUKGR3K6YSI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There are several ways that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and ACIP, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices within the CDC, do this continuous monitoring. One is via the Vaccine Safety Datalink, which researchers use to analyze health data from millions of people to find any adverse impacts of immunizations. Another is CISA, the Clinical Immunization Safety Project, a national network of CDC vaccine safety experts and research centers that investigates any potential health issues following immunization and works directly with patients to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="PNWY5MKR3JFB7M45O3QGUJEABY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;There’s also VAERS, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which allows individuals to submit potential issues following vaccination. This self-reported data, in conjunction with other ongoing testing, can help experts identify whether reported side effects are in fact tied to the vaccines themselves. Pharmaceutical companies do their own product safety studies as well. Vaccine experts told us that vaccines are &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; safety-tested than other medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IGC4GCAGUFDXXKBDVEJV5KB4QQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kennedy has &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/01/28/rfk-jr-disparaged-vaccines-dozens-times-recent-years-misled-race/" target="_blank"&gt;long disparaged vaccines&lt;/a&gt; and often speaks about the need to placebo-test them — referring to a process in which one group gets vaccinated while the other does not. The Washington Post found that in at least &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/02/11/rfk-jr-vaccine-testing-concerns/" target="_blank"&gt;34 appearances&lt;/a&gt; before becoming secretary, he called for placebo-controlled studies for vaccines that have already been approved for use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="H5W7KCYRDNCDFEEHF4XCGHL4FU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Kennedy often says he is not anti-vaccine but is seeking to restore “gold standard” science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2L5TH7VHQVHNXNRUH43IJP6S3Q" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Vaccines for diseases that don’t have an existing one — such as the original coronavirus vaccine — &lt;i&gt;do&lt;/i&gt; undergo this testing. For diseases that have an available vaccine, new vaccines are tested against older versions — and public health experts say it would be unethical to deprive people of a vaccine that would protect them from harmful or deadly pathogens. Doing so would be like not giving a thousand children in Chicago an immunization while their neighbors got vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="XF2NODKMEVGULOUCT6H6RP7AXU" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In early May, Kennedy’s HHS &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/04/30/rfk-jr-vaccine-testing/" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that all new vaccines would be required to undergo placebo testing but did not clarify what would count as a “new vaccine.” When pressed by a senator about what he meant during a hearing in front of the Appropriations Committee on Tuesday, Kennedy went back on his previous statements to say, “I don’t think that it’s ethical to go back and retest those vaccines against the placebo. ”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X3RPWH4MYBHVPLWGIERZ56HU7M" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a response to a lightly edited question &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2025/05/16/rfk-health-vaccines-questions-answers/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;we received from a reader&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 02:14:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMifEFVX3lxTE51RUlWM0VJNVpoRVZnTjM3elhlRmlyMHFpUS0xb2dsYWlOSzhwS1cyejYzS1RzODBuN0pGd3dmekFwM2hjQVlsSy1WTjlTWnI0QW1UNHFsQlF5d2hLbkVSUjBNdVotNXR4QjNjS0hXb3E4MUFXQjVMUkR5Nlk</guid></item><item><title>对Covid-19疫苗注射不确定？专家们发现了一种可能更好的新替代方案-印度时报 | Not sure about the Covid-19 vaccine jab?

India has recorded 257 COVID-19 cases as of Monday, May 19, as per the Union Health Ministry.The health authorities are vigilant, especially with the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/jn-1-variant" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;JN.1 variant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, a sublineage of Omicron, spreading globally. Vaccination played a crucial role in preventing the virus during the pandemic. Now, researchers have discovered a promising alternative to traditional COVID-19 shots, one that may be safer, more effective, and better at stopping the virus where it first enters the body: the nose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How are &lt;keyword id="26933613" type="General" weightage="20" keywordseo="nasal-vaccines" source="keywords"&gt;nasal vaccines&lt;/keyword&gt; different from traditional ones&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study by the researchers from Yale University found that nasal vaccine boosters could offer safer and more targeted protection against respiratory diseases such as COVID-19, without the need for traditional immune-boosting additives. The findings are published in the journal Nature Immunology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most vaccines and boosters are administered as injections directly into the muscle tissue, usually in the upper arm. But for respiratory diseases like COVID-19, protection right where the virus enters, the respiratory tract, could be crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Signs that all is not well with your liver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that nasal vaccine boosters can trigger strong immune defenses in the respiratory tract, even without the help of immune-boosting ingredients known as adjuvants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study shows how a simple viral protein antigen can boost respiratory tract immune responses against viruses,” said Akiko Iwasaki, Sterling Professor of Immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine (YSM) and senior author of the study. “These data imply that viral proteins in nasal spray may be used as a safe way to promote antiviral immunity at the site of viral entry.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mechanism of nasal vaccines&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand the mechanism of the nasal vaccines, the researchers first injected mice with a traditional mRNA COVID-19 shot, directly into the muscle. Later, they gave the mice a booster vaccine through the nose. The researchers wanted to see the effects of vaccine boosters that don’t contain special ingredients known as adjuvants. This ingredient is used in some vaccines, to help stimulate a stronger, longer-lasting immune response.However, they can also have adverse effects, like inflammation and swelling of facial nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We call this vaccine strategy ‘prime and spike’, which is where the mice were intramuscularly primed with mRNA vaccines followed by a nasal boosting with unadjuvanted spike protein,” Dong-il Kwon, a postdoctoral fellow in Yale’s Department of Immunobiology, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ‘prime and spike’ vaccine approach jumpstarts the immune response in the respiratory system, the first part of the body infected by COVID-19. ‘Prime’ refers to the process of administering a traditional intramuscular vaccine shot, while ‘spike’ refers to a follow-up vaccination delivered to the nose, usually in the form of a spray containing coronavirus-derived spike proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="39"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists found that only the nasal booster triggered a strong local immune response. Other boosters, including intramuscular injection, didn’t produce much IgA or activate immune cells in the lungs of the mice. When the researchers gave the mice a second nasal booster, their IgA levels increased even more in both the lungs and nasal passages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings help explain why nasal boosters do not require adjuvants to induce robust mucosal immunity at the respiratory mucosa and can be used to design safe and effective vaccines against respiratory virus pathogens,” Kwon added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular COVID-19 shots don’t create much IgA in the nose and lungs. This is why people can still get infected or pass it on, even if they’re vaccinated. However, this study found that nasal boosters can trigger strong, long-lasting immune protection where respiratory diseases like COVID-19 first attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Understanding how this safe and simple nasal booster promotes protective mucosal immunity will make it easier to develop this approach for human use in the near future,” Iwasaki said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 01:58:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMioAJBVV95cUxOYjhXLVJZS1JQemFpMk5NeFIySzJqTTNjd2F2UnVBNUtidXcxZFN2TmFGb0hTcGVXamZ6cF9RcVlPNllIRlFEX1hHckZfOVZZUWdHVHd5eUMycV9WcTJqVHRVcmFFdmZXM1pPLUlKV1dGTTYzTWRna2FPNTZBYjJTOGtURk91UkpoZi1kRVhVaUt4YndidkpCX2Zrc3hwRE5lNV9LV3pWNXprRFJVVkRGU2phTFktMzdyTFJVb0FQbnpITkR4eGd5WmRvZzRvMVFzWWtVX0Fja0pzNVQ0TjVKT3A1b2VjWmpkUk8yT25LbjJPSjBHVlNWNzVHWWt4eDRzbHA2akNxUjRwRl9PSVFjRWp5LVpaU2Z5UnVWVnIzNlQ</guid></item><item><title>发现新的西澳麻疹病例-《西雅图时报》 | New WA measles case identified -

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Nearly half of American adults have high blood pressure—a preventable and treatable risk factor for heart disease and stroke.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The good news is, changes to your diet and lifestyle habits can help lower your blood pressure and reduce the risk of heart disease, and the DASH diet is a great place to start. Plus, you can shop for everything you need at your favorite neighborhood big box store—Costco!
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unlike ultra-restrictive fad diets, the &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938379/the-1-diet-to-lower-high-blood-pressure-according-to-science/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;DASH diet&lt;/a&gt; encourages:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned tuna is a convenient, affordable way to incorporate more protein into your meals and snacks. “Tuna is also an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids,” says &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/author/lauren-manaker/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lauren Manaker, M.S., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;. Eating healthy omega-3 fats like DHA and EPA is linked to lower blood pressure. Plus, studies show that eating a variety of proteins from different sources—think meat, fish, beans and whole grains—can lower the risk of developing high blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Safe Catch Ahi Tuna is a convenient option available at Costco. It stands apart from other tuna brands because it guarantees a mercury level lower than the FDA action limit,” adds Manaker.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Try our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lemon-dill-tuna-salad-8684016" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lemon-Dill Tuna Salad&lt;/a&gt; between two pieces of whole-wheat bread as a sandwich or with tender Bibb lettuce. One serving has almost 30 grams of protein and less than 500 milligrams of sodium.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-2-unsalted-mixed-nuts"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 2. Unsalted Mixed Nuts &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Kirkland Signature unsalted mixed nuts are a great pantry staple to keep on hand for those looking to control or lower their blood pressure,” says &lt;a href="https://theeverydaykidneycook.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Beverly Garden, RD, LDN&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A 1-ounce serving contains no sodium, making it a great snack choice. About 70% of the sodium in our diet comes from packaged and processed foods, like many convenient snack foods.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  There’s also 190 mg of potassium in a serving. That’s only about 5% of your daily needs but it’s still an added benefit, especially as a sodium-free snack.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research shows that consuming enough potassium, about 4,700 mg daily, is key to promoting healthy blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; According to Garden, a potassium-rich diet can help manage blood pressure in two simple ways. First, it helps your body eliminate extra sodium through urine, which can reduce blood pressure. Second, potassium helps blood vessels relax, making it easier for blood to flow and lowering pressure in the blood vessels.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Nuts are also a good source of fiber, and eating a high-fiber diet is associated with lower blood pressure,”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; says Garden.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-3-olive-oil"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 3. Olive Oil &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Costco is a great place to buy affordable, high-quality oils for cooking and salad dressings,” says &lt;a href="https://www.danataylornutrition.com/about" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dana Taylor, M.P.A., RDN, LD&lt;/a&gt;. “Look for extra-virgin olive oil, which supports healthy blood pressure, heart health and has anti-inflammatory properties.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Studies show that olive oil’s high oleic acid and antioxidant polyphenol content are beneficial for lowering blood pressure, and that’s why it’s often recommended as one of the best fat choices for hypertension.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Kirkland Signature Organic Quinoa is a dietitian-approved Costco favorite for lowering blood pressure. “With 3 grams of fiber and 6 grams of protein per serving, quinoa makes a great addition to any salad, grain bowl or stir-fry,” says &lt;a href="https://bewellnutritioncounseling.com/about/" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Ana Pruteanu, M.S., RD&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Consuming a diet high in fiber, at least 25 grams for women and 38 grams for men daily, can help you manage high blood pressure.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Gut microbes digest fiber, which creates short-chain fatty acids, health-promoting compounds with antihypertensive effects,” explains Pruteanu.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are many ways to boost your fiber intake with quinoa.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Don’t leave Costco without snagging the Kirkland Signature Three Berry Blend from the freezer aisle. “Berries are packed with potassium and fiber, which play a key role in lowering blood pressure,”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; says &lt;a href="https://inutritioncenter.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Vanessa Imus, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Forget about molding berries in the crisper drawer of your fridge. Frozen berries are incredibly versatile and have a longer shelf life than their fresh counterparts. “You can toss them into Greek yogurt, blend them into a smoothie or even stir them into oatmeal for a heart-healthy, antioxidant-rich boost,” recommends Imus.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_55-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Costco is a great place to buy heart-healthy salmon. Whether it’s canned salmon or fresh, and both offer blood pressure-lowering benefits. “Go for the Kirkland Signature Wild Alaskan pink salmon,” says &lt;a href="http://www.soundbitesnutrition.com" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Lisa Andrews, M.Ed., RD, LD&lt;/a&gt;. “While these cans come in 6-ounce portions, they can be split to make two servings or shared with a friend.”

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_60-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Eating a healthy diet like the DASH diet is one way you can manage your blood pressure. Other lifestyle factors that help lower blood pressure include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_62-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay hydrated.&lt;/strong&gt; “Dehydration can cause the blood vessels to constrict, decreasing blood flow and raising blood pressure,” says Kolesa. The general rule of thumb is 64 ounces of water per day, but some people may need more depending on factors like activity level, health conditions, age and sex.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get moving. &lt;/strong&gt;Aim for about 30 minutes daily or 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity weekly. Try this &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-exercise-for-better-blood-pressure-8619767" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;#1 Exercise You Should Be Doing for Better Blood Pressure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize sleep. &lt;/strong&gt;Get at least seven hours of sleep per night for healthy blood pressure and disease prevention.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_67-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Costco has a variety of heart-healthy ingredients to help lower your blood pressure. Aside from adding these dietitian favorites to your Costco cart, try following the DASH diet, staying hydrated, exercising regularly and prioritizing sleep to help keep your blood pressure down.&lt;br&gt;

Gonorrhoea is becoming increasingly difficult to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Most cases are treated with a single dose of antibiotics, but there is an 80-year history of the bacterium which causes gonorrhoea repeatedly evolving resistance to our antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It's happening to the current treatments too and is why some doctors &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/antibiotic-resistant-gonorrhoea-cases-rising-in-england#:~:text=Katy%20Sinka%2C%20Consultant%20Epidemiologist%20and,pelvic%20inflammatory%20disease%20and%20infertility" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;are concerned gonorrhoea could one-day become untreatable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The best way to deal with a drug-resistant infection is to never catch it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Dr Amanda Doyle, from NHS England, said: "The launch of a world-first routine vaccination for gonorrhoea is a huge step forward for sexual health and will be crucial in protecting individuals, helping to prevent the spread of infection and reduce the rising rates of antibiotic resistant strains of the bacteria."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The people most affected by gonorrhoea in the UK are those aged 16-to-25, gay and bisexual men, and those of black and Caribbean ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The vaccine – which costs around £8 per dose – is value for money when primarily offered to gay and bisexual men, rather than all teenagers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;However, clinicians do have the freedom to use their own judgement and offer the vaccine to people using sexual health services they think are of equally high risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;People will be offered mpox (formerly known as monkeypox), HPV and hepatitis vaccines at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof Matt Phillips, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, said: "This is excellent news and a landmark moment for sexual health in England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"Gonorrhoea diagnoses are at their highest since records began and this has the potential to help us to turn that around."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;It is not known how long the protection provided by the vaccine will last or how often booster jabs might be required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The decision comes almost a year and a half after a vaccination programme was recommended by the UK's JCVI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Sexual health campaigners had criticised that long wait, but have welcomed this decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Katie Clark, head of policy and advocacy at the Terrance Higgins Trust, called it a "huge win".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Listen to Newsbeat &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/live:bbc_radio_one" class="sc-f9178328-0 bGFWdi"&gt;live&lt;/a&gt;

in the brain as a whole plastic spoon. The paper, published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03453-1" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nature Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in February, revealed that the amount of microplastics—tiny plastic particles smaller than 5 millimeters—in the human brain appears to be increasing: Concentrations rose by about 50% between 2016 and 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Not only were there more microplastics in the brain than in liver or kidney tissue, but microplastic concentrations were higher in the brains of dementia patients than in those without it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Now, scientists are examining the effect on brain health of microplastics and one of the largest sources of microplastics: ultra-processed foods (UPFs). In a series of four papers published in the journal &lt;a href="https://genomicpress.kglmeridian.com/view/journals/brainmed/aop/issue.xml" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Brain Medicine;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brain Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researchers synthesize mounting evidence that microplastics accumulating in the brain—especially those from UPFs—could be contributing to rising global rates of dementia, depression, and other mental health disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“We’re seeing converging evidence that should concern us all,” said co-author of &lt;a href="https://genomicpress.kglmeridian.com/view/journals/brainmed/aop/article-10.61373-bm025v.0068/article-10.61373-bm025v.0068.xml" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one of the papers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;one of the papers&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Nicholas Fabiano from the University of Ottawa, in the &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1084276?" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:press release;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Ultra-processed foods now comprise more than 50% of energy intake in countries like the United States, and these foods contain significantly higher concentrations of microplastics than whole foods,” Fabiano said. “Recent findings show these particles can cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in alarming quantities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="mb-4 text-xl font-bold md:text-2xl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The combined impact of microplastics and ultra-processed foods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The researchers consolidate the science linking UPF consumption with adverse mental health, and how that overlaps with microplastic accumulation in the brain. For instance, they cite a 2024 umbrella review published in the &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/384/bmj-2023-077310" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:British Medical Journal;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;British Medical Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which found that people who consumed ultra-processed foods had a 22% higher risk of depression, 48% higher risk of anxiety, and 41% higher risk of poor sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In the papers, the researchers hypothesize that microplastics could be the missing link in UPFs’ impact on brain health, by connecting it to data such as UPFs like chicken nuggets contain 30 times more microplastics per gram than chicken breasts—highlighting how processing could increase microplastic content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Ultra-processed foods have been linked to adverse mental health through inflammation, oxidative stress, epigenetics, mitochondrial dysfunction, and disruptions to neurotransmitter systems. Microplastics appear to operate through remarkably similar pathways,” said Wolfgang Marx from Deakin University’s Food &amp;amp; Mood Center in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Microplastics can increase inflammation in the brain as they cross the blood-brain barrier, as a &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/15/12308" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:2023 study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;2023 study&lt;/a&gt; on mice found, which can put people at risk of neurological disease and degeneration, including Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“What emerges from this work is not a warning. It is a reckoning,” &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.61373/bm025g.0062" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:wrote;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.upstate.edu/psych/faculty.php?empID=wongma" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Ma-Li Wong;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Ma-Li Wong&lt;/a&gt;, professor of neuroscience at Upstate Medical University in New York. “The boundary between internal and external has failed. If microplastics cross the blood-brain barrier, what else do we think remains sacred?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers are now looking to understand to what extent ultra-processed foods are responsible for adverse brain health outcomes, and what to do about it. The authors propose the development of a Dietary Microplastic Index, which would quantify people’s exposure through food consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“While we need to reduce our exposure to microplastics through better food choices and packaging alternatives, we also need research into how to remove these particles from the human body,” &lt;a href="https://genomicpress.kglmeridian.com/view/journals/brainmed/aop/article-10.61373-bm025l.0056/article-10.61373-bm025l.0056.xml" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:noted;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; Dr. Stefan Bornstein in his paper. One of those potential methods, Bornstein proposes, is apheresis, a process of removing blood from the body and filtering out the microplastics—but he points out that more research is still needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“As the levels of ultra-processed foods, microplastics, and adverse mental health outcomes simultaneously rise, it is imperative that we further investigate this potential association,” said Fabiano. “After all, you are what you eat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For more on microplastics:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This story was originally featured on &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/well/2025/05/20/the-plastic-spoon-of-microplastics-in-your-brain-could-stem-from-these-foods-that-are-wrecking-your-health-researchers-say/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Fortune.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Fortune.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 00:06:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMijwFBVV95cUxNdWF1c0pPb2RQempLN1lpWXZqNm4wTlpoYnB1VDRlTE9Qcm1VaVFKS1NVeXBVbVdfTkxFUGhZWFVPUlI1WXRCaThhSU1jY2ViNklTM054am8zVC1sSl9nVGNfVllZWDkwT0JHSFIxbUVFNnY0R3hIa3hzQlNQZXZqaVpVY0wzR1JSbk5HZHFQNA</guid></item><item><title>红肉对心脏有害吗？这可能取决于谁资助了这项研究。-《纽约时报》 | Is Red Meat Bad for Your Heart?

Red meat appeared healthier in studies that were funded by the red meat industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Of course, this is not surprising to anyone familiar with nutrition research, which often has conflicts of interest because of a lack of federal funding. But it is yet another example of how industry-linked studies might shape the way people understand, and potentially misunderstand, the health consequences of what they eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Past research funded by the sugar industry, for instance, has downplayed the relationship between sugar and health conditions &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/well/eat/how-the-sugar-industry-shifted-blame-to-fat.html" title=""&gt;like obesity and heart disease&lt;/a&gt;. And studies &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/health/nih-alcohol-study-liquor-industry.html" title=""&gt;funded by the alcohol industry&lt;/a&gt; have suggested that moderate drinking could be part of a healthy diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Miguel López Moreno, a researcher at Francisco de Vitoria University in Spain who led the new analysis, said in an email that he wanted to know if similar issues were happening with the research on unprocessed red meat. Processed meats like bacon and sausage have consistently been linked with heart disease risk, he said, but the evidence for unprocessed red meats like steaks and pork chops has been “far more mixed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The question is timely, as influential people like the U.S. health secretary, Robert F.

&lt;p&gt;“The New Jersey Department of Health (NJDOH) is alerting residents about potential exposures associated with a newly identified case of measles in a non-NJ resident who attended a concert in NJ while infectious,” officials said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warning was issued for those who attended Shakira’s concert on Thursday night into Friday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials said that potentially exposed individuals “could develop symptoms as late as June 6.” Those could include high fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes and a facial or hairline rash that tends to appear within five days of infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-papQS7n5" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_papQS7n5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where in the stadium the infected person was seated, where they live and how they arrived to the concert isn’t clear. Due to a &lt;a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/05/18/nj-transit-strike-over-tentative-agreement-reached/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New Jersey Transit strike that’s since been resolved&lt;/a&gt;, Garden State buses and trains were not operating when Shakira performed, though Coach USA buses brought some passengers from Port Authority to New Jersey for the shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While vaccinations protect against measles, the World Health Organization says there’s&lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; no specific treatment&lt;/a&gt; for the very preventable yet highly infectious virus. The New York State Department of Health has recorded &lt;a href="https://www.health.ny.gov/diseases/communicable/measles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;five cases of measles in New York City&lt;/a&gt; and six cases outside the five boroughs so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem’s much worse in Texas, where 722 people had tested positive as of Tuesday. &lt;a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/04/06/measles-outbreak-second-child-dies-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Two unvaccinated children&lt;/a&gt; with no underlying health conditions have &lt;a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/2025/02/26/measles-death-texas-outbreak-first-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;died from measles&lt;/a&gt; since late February, according to health officials in the Lone Star State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A new study suggests that eating foods with live microbes may have benefits for those with hypertension.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Eating more microbe-rich foods may also counteract the effect of being sedentary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fermented foods like kefir, kimchi, sauerkraut and some yogurts contain live microbes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High blood pressure, or hypertension, is a common health issue that affects millions of people worldwide and can lower both the quality and length of life.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Finding ways to lower the risks for those with hypertension is very important—that’s why researchers recently undertook a new study to determine if live microbes could be beneficial for those dealing with high blood pressure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Including certain live microorganisms in your diet through foods or supplements (like probiotics) has become a promising way to &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2059033/best-and-worst-foods-to-eat-for-gut-health/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;support gut health&lt;/a&gt; and improve heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Fermented foods like kefir, kimchi and some yogurts can be good sources of live microbes. In this new study published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt;, the researchers looked at how both dietary live microbes and sedentary behavior can affect people with hypertension.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you have a desk job, spend your days driving or prefer to spend your weekends hanging out on the couch, sitting for long periods can easily become a normal part of everyday life. But too much sedentary time can have serious impacts on heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For instance, long periods of sitting can harm the health of your blood vessels. When we sit too much, the normal function of the cells lining our blood vessels gets disrupted. This can make it harder for the blood vessels to relax and work properly, which raises blood pressure and contributes to other health issues.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Large-scale studies on human populations are still needed to confirm whether reducing sedentary behavior—and consuming live microbes—can effectively manage high blood pressure in the long term. This study in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; aims to bridge that knowledge gap—let’s unpack what it found.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-how-was-this-study-conducted"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; How Was This Study Conducted? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To investigate the association between dietary microbes intake and sedentary behavior with mortality risk in adults with high blood pressure in the United States, researchers used information from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database, which was designed to gather important details about the health and nutrition of people living in the U.S. More than 15,000 individuals with hypertension were included in the analysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The study looked at how much live microbes people consumed in their diets and how that might connect to a sedentary lifestyle. The researchers suggest that most sterile or processed foods don’t contain many live microorganisms, while fresh fruits and vegetables with their skins on have moderate amounts. Foods like yogurt or fermented vegetables often have the highest levels of live microbes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To measure this, participants shared what they ate over a 24-hour period, and foods were grouped based on their microbe content. The groups included low microbe intake (mostly processed or sterile foods), moderate intake (some fresh produce) and high intake (fermented or unprocessed foods with lots of microbes). Participants were then categorized into one of these three groups based on their food choices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To understand how much time people spent sitting each day, researchers used a simple questionnaire called the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ). Interviewers asked participants about their daily sitting time, including activities like working at a desk, commuting in a car or on public transportation, watching TV, reading or using a computer. Based on their answers, participants were grouped into three categories of sitting time: less than five hours per day, five to eight hours per day, or more than eight hours per day. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To examine survival outcomes, researchers used existing health data to understand who was still alive by the end of the study period, which concluded at the end of 2019. Additional factors like diet, use of probiotics and salt intake were considered for a more detailed analysis.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-did-this-study-find"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Did This Study Find? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; After analyzing the available data, the researchers found that people who ate the least live-microbe foods had a higher risk of death from all causes and heart disease, while those who ate the most had a lower risk. Additionally, those who spent fewer than five hours a day sitting had the lowest risk of death, but people who sat for five to eight hours and those who sat for more than eight hours had similar risks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To better understand how diet and sitting time affect health, researchers investigated the link between diet, sedentary lifestyle and health outcomes further. They found that sitting for long hours was linked to a higher risk of death. Specifically, for every extra hour spent sitting, the risk of dying from any cause went up by 6%, and the risk of dying from heart problems increased by 6.5%. On the other hand, eating more live-microbe foods was protective. People with medium or high intake of live-microbe foods had significantly lower risks of death compared to those who ate very little. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Interestingly, the study revealed a “U-shaped” relationship between sitting time and the risk of death from all causes. This means that both very low and very high amounts of sitting are linked to higher health risks, while moderate sitting—around four hours a day—appears safer. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When they split the participants into two groups—one that sat for more than 4.1 hours a day and one group that sat for less—they found that for those in the more-sitting group, eating live-microbe foods was especially beneficial. For individuals who did sit longer, eating moderate or high amounts of those foods helped lower their risk of heart-related deaths significantly. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Even though a clear link between eating these foods and lower overall death risk wasn’t found for all groups, the general trend showed that people who ate more live microbe-rich foods tended to have better health outcomes. These findings underline how combining less sitting with healthier food choices may be beneficial for people with high blood pressure.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There are a few key study limitations to keep in mind. First, while the authors based their classification of dietary live microbes on widely accepted expert guidelines found in many studies, the actual amount of microbes in different foods wasn’t precisely measured, which could lead to some inaccuracies in the analysis. Second, the data used about diet and activity levels comes from self-reported surveys, meaning people may not always remember or report their eating and sitting habits accurately. Additionally, the study focuses only on people in the U.S., who may have different lifestyles, healthcare access, and genetics than people in other parts of the world, people should be cautious about applying these findings globally. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have high blood pressure, the study's findings suggest that taking certain steps in your daily habits may offer some benefits. By reducing sitting time to less than 4.1 hours per day, you may lower their risk of death, particularly from heart-related issues, based on these results. Incorporating more live microbe-rich foods (like yogurt, fermented vegetables and fresh produce with skins) into your diet also appears to support heart health. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; And while live microbes may sound like an intimidating eat, they’re actually pretty easy to ease into. Start with a recipe like our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/257793/berry-kefir-smoothie/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Berry Kefir Smoothie&lt;/a&gt; for a snack or a light breakfast. Make your day a little more savory by adding &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/250931/simple-sauerkraut/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;sauerkraut&lt;/a&gt; to your sandwiches. And if you prefer a  make-ahead treat, prep our &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lemon-raspberry-frozen-yogurt-bites-11687804" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;Lemon-Raspberry Frozen Yogurt Bites&lt;/a&gt; and enjoy them on a piping hot day.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_48-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; This study published in &lt;em&gt;Scientific Reports&lt;/em&gt; highlights the importance of small, actionable lifestyle changes that may make a significant impact on the health of those living with high blood pressure. Reducing the time spent sitting each day and incorporating more live microbe-rich foods into your diet may offer protective benefits for heart health and overall longevity. These findings emphasize that even gradual adjustments to daily routines, like standing up more frequently or adding a serving of fermented vegetables to your meals, could prove valuable in managing health risks associated with hypertension.

              &lt;p&gt;Some common germs might plant the seed for dementia later in life. Research out today has found a link between several infectious diseases, particularly herpes simplex-1 (HSV-1), and a greater risk of Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at Gilead Sciences conducted the study, &lt;a href="http://press.psprings.co.uk/Open/may/bmjopen093946.pdf"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday in BMJ Open. They analyzed the medical records of Americans with health insurance, finding that people with Alzheimer’s and related conditions were also more likely to be diagnosed with HSV-1. The findings are the latest to suggest that the prevention and treatment of HSV-1 and similar viruses can be an effective measure against dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s is the most common form of &lt;a href="https://www.alz.org/getmedia/ef8f48f9-ad36-48ea-87f9-b74034635c1e/alzheimers-facts-and-figures.pdf"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt;, affecting roughly 7 million Americans today. Most cases are caused by a complex mix of environmental and/or genetic factors. In recent years, many studies have suggested that certain infections—HSV-1 included—can be part of that equation. HSV-1 is the primary cause of oral herpes, commonly known as cold sores, though most infected people will experience few or no symptoms; it can also cause genital herpes (primarily caused by HSV-2).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Not every &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187874792300716X?via%3Dihub"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; has supported this viral link, however, so the authors decided to take a look for themselves, with the help of real-world data. According to lead researcher Luke Liu, this is the first study to use a large database of insurance claims in the U.S. to examine the connection between Alzheimer’s and HSV-1.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Liu and his team compared the health outcomes of nearly 400,000 Americans diagnosed with Alzheimer’s to people without Alzheimer’s who were matched in age, sex, and other factors. Only a small percentage of people with Alzheimer’s had a past HSV-1 diagnosis (a bit under 0.5%), but they still had it more often than controls (about 80% more likely).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The researchers then looked at a broader group of people with other forms of dementia related to Alzheimer’s, finding a similar pattern. They additionally found a link between Alzheimer’s and two other herpesviruses, herpes simplex-2 and varicella zoster virus, the cause of chickenpox and shingles. Interestingly, they also found that people who took antiviral treatment for their HSV-1 were less likely to develop Alzheimer’s than people with HSV-1 who didn’t receive treatment (antivirals can suppress and shorten active outbreaks, though not cure the infection).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Observational studies like this one can’t prove a cause-and-effect link between HSV-1 and Alzheimer’s, but the case for such a connection only appears to be getting stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“Exposure to herpesviruses is likely to be associated with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementia, and antiherpetic medications can be protective against Alzheimer’s and related dementia,” Liu, a virologist at Gilead, told Gizmodo in an email.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There remain important questions about this association, including the actual mechanisms involved. Some research has suggested our brain’s immune system produces &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273%2818%2930526-9"&gt;amyloid beta&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.health.pitt.edu/news/herpes-virus-might-drive-alzheimers-pathology-study-suggests"&gt;tau&lt;/a&gt; to defend against herpesvirus infection, for instance (the misfolded forms of these proteins are the key drivers of Alzheimer’s). But there might be more ways that HSV-1 and similar viruses can set off or accelerate the condition.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Other factors almost certainly play a role, especially since many people contract HSV-1 in their lifetime but never develop Alzheimer’s. Roughly two-thirds of the world’s population under age 50 &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/herpes-simplex-virus"&gt;carries&lt;/a&gt; HSV-1, according to the World Health Organization. The researchers note that the HSV-1/Alzheimer’s link is even stronger in older people, and other research suggests that people carrying the ApoE-ε4 allele—a genetic variant that already increases Alzheimer’s risk—also seem more susceptible to HSV-1 infection. So these viruses are likely one of the many dominos that can fall and eventually lead to Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="not-prose"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Still, the overall evidence does indicate that people can meaningfully lower their dementia risk by treating or preventing certain infections. Several studies have found a link between &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/unique-study-is-latest-to-show-shingles-vaccine-can-prevent-dementia-2000583567"&gt;shingles vaccination and reduced Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt;, for instance. Clinical trials testing whether antiviral treatments for herpes can lower dementia risk could be warranted, though Liu notes that kind of research will take considerable resources to get off the ground. Research is also ongoing to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8691362/"&gt;develop vaccines&lt;/a&gt; for HSV-1 and HSV-2—research that might be more worthwhile than currently assumed.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“These findings place an even greater emphasis on viewing the prevention of herpesviruses as a public health priority,” the researchers wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symptomatic infection with the virus responsible for cold sores around the mouth–herpes simplex 1, or HSV-1 for short—may have a key role in the development of Alzheimer's disease, suggests a large US study published in &lt;i&gt;BMJ Open&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;But treatment with antiviral therapy seems to be linked to a lower risk of this type of dementia, suggesting that treatment to quell HSV-1 symptoms may be protective, the findings indicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, around 35.6 million people worldwide live with dementia, and 7.7 million new cases are diagnosed every year, say the researchers. Alzheimer's disease comprises 60%–80% of all dementias, with total costs for its treatment reaching US$305 billion in 2020, they add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various infectious agents have been implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease, and the most studied of these is HSV-1, which affected more than two-thirds of under 50s around the globe in 2016 alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To shed further light on the mooted role of HSV-1 in Alzheimer's disease and the potential protective effects of antiherpetic drugs, the researchers drew on a large set of US administrative claims data (IQVIA PharMetrics Plus) for the period 2006–21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease were matched for age, sex, geographical region, database entry year, and number of health care visits with those without any history of neurological disease, resulting in a total of 344,628 case–control pairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly two thirds (65%) of those with Alzheimer's disease were women. Their average age was 73 and they tended to have more co-existing conditions—all &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/risk+factors/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;risk factors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all, 1,507 (just under 0.5%) people with Alzheimer's disease had been diagnosed with HSV-1 (0.44%) compared with 823 (just under 0.25%) of those in the comparison (control) group.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, the risk of Alzheimer's disease rose in tandem with age. But, overall, the likelihood of an HSV-1 diagnosis was 80% higher among those with Alzheimer's disease, after adjusting for potentially influential factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the 2,330 people with a history of HSV-1 infection, 931 (40%) used antiherpetic medication after their diagnosis. And they were 17% less likely to develop Alzheimer's disease than those who didn't use these treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers also looked at the potential role of other herpes viruses, including HSV-2, varicella zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus. Both HSV-2 and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/varicella+zoster+virus/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;varicella zoster virus&lt;/a&gt; infections were also associated with a heightened risk of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly how HSV-1 and other neurotropic viruses might heighten the risk of dementia isn't clear, point out the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"However, studies have shown that inflammatory alterations in the brain caused by HSV infection are pivotal in [Alzheimer's disease] development," they explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It has been reported that Aβ peptides are deposited in response to HSV infection and protect host cells by blocking viral fusion with the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/plasma+membrane/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;plasma membrane&lt;/a&gt;, pointing to HSV as a potential risk factor for [Alzheimer's disease]. Consistently, Aβ exhibits antimicrobial properties against various pathogens, including HSV-1," they add.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;HSV-1 DNA is also found in the plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, and people carrying the ApoE ε4 allele, the most common genetic risk factor for the disease, are more susceptible to HSV infections, they note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an observational study, and as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. And the researchers acknowledge that HSV-1 infections before the patient's inclusion in the database weren't known, added to which many people with the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/infection/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;infection&lt;/a&gt; don't have symptoms, while others might not seek treatment when they do–all factors that might influence the findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But their findings are in line with those of other studies. And they suggest, "While the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/molecular+mechanisms/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;molecular mechanisms&lt;/a&gt; remain to be fully elucidated, these results are indicative of a possible role for antiherpetic therapy in mitigating dementia risk."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They conclude, "These findings place an even greater emphasis on viewing the prevention of herpes viruses as a public health priority."&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers have learned that the brain’s protective coating of sugars loses some of its heft with age, and that this sugar loss might undermine the brain’s defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobel laureate &lt;a href="https://chemistry.stanford.edu/people/carolyn-bertozzi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Carolyn Bertozzi&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href="https://www.stanford.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stanford University&lt;/a&gt;, became curious about this sugary armor and looked into whether replenishing it could tighten the brain’s protective barrier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That barrier, called the blood-brain barrier, is designed to let in necessary &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/eating-foods-with-these-key-nutrients-will-dramatically-slow-brain-aging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;nutrients&lt;/a&gt; while blocking harmful substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-shift-in-the-sweet-layer"&gt;Shift in the sweet layer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sugar coat, known as the glycocalyx, sits on cells that form the blood-brain barrier. A recent study in mice found that the glycocalyx becomes thinner over time, leaving gaps that invite unwanted molecules to slip in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re stepping outside for the first time and trying to make sense of what’s out there,” said Carolyn Bertozzi, referencing how little attention sugar molecules have received compared to more commonly studied proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worry is that even minor openings can let inflammatory molecules and other damaging factors spread through the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/sitting-for-hours-daily-shrinks-your-brain-even-if-you-exercise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;. Over the long run, that infiltration can potentially &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn3114" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;diminish memory&lt;/a&gt; and other cognitive abilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brain-sugar-layers-step-up-the-defense"&gt;Brain sugar layers step up the defense&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists realized that reintroducing key sugar components helped recover some lost protection. These sugar additions seemed to restore the boundary and slow ongoing inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Modulating glycans has a major effect on the brain – both negatively in aging, when these sugars are lost, and positively, when they are restored,” explained lead researcher &lt;a href="https://biox.stanford.edu/people/sophia-shi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sophia Shi&lt;/a&gt;, from Stanford University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boosting the supply of specific sugars supported the barrier’s integrity in older mice. That allowed fewer damaging molecules to enter the brain and showed hints of improved brain function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that addressing this sugar gap in the glycocalyx gave the animals a better shot at memory recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-memory-on-the-line"&gt;Memory on the line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work lays the foundation for a new field of inquiry into how the aging brain loses its resilience,” said &lt;a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/tony-wyss-coray" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tony Wyss-Coray&lt;/a&gt;, from Stanford University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brain tests of learning and recall showed that mice with replenished sugar layers performed better at certain &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/brain-mapping-research-mouse-neurons-revolutionary-advance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;memory&lt;/a&gt; tasks for the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small gains can mean a lot when fighting cognitive decline. Scientists have long searched for fresh ways to help people fend off the forgetfulness that comes with advanced age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that a few sugars can shore up such a crucial brain barrier adds a new angle to that search. Many existing therapies attempt to stop buildup of harmful proteins, so a sugar-based approach is a different track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-this-could-mean"&gt;What this could mean&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blood-brain barrier poses a challenge for anyone developing medications. This barrier acts as a gatekeeper, but a weakened &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00424-007-0212-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;barrier&lt;/a&gt; also raises red flags, since it might let in bigger trouble. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thicker sugar layer could fine-tune how well the barrier behaves, keeping the brain safe yet still admitting vital substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This discovery might influence how researchers design treatments, especially for &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/neuroinflammation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;neuroinflammation&lt;/a&gt; and conditions like Alzheimer’s disease. If a failing sugar shield is a factor in disease progression, adjusting it could help keep the brain in &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-identify-the-brain-region-responsible-for-consciousness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;better shape&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-discoveries-lead-next"&gt;Where discoveries lead next&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bertozzi, Shi, and their colleagues plan to sort out which sugar types have the most impact. They also aim to figure out how these sugars interact with other protective molecules. The researchers suspect there could be multiple targets for preserving or replenishing the glycocalyx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one is certain exactly how it might work in humans yet, but many age-related vulnerabilities revolve around the same principle of barrier instability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improved knowledge of sugar biology could lead to novel therapies that cross the blood-brain barrier more effectively without causing harmful leaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-brain-sugar-health"&gt;Brain sugar health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even for those who are younger, understanding how sugars stabilize the brain’s immune privileges may open up better strategies for warding off disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists suggest that a well-kept glycocalyx might help people recover from infections or injuries involving the &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/alzheimers-may-not-be-a-brain-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exploring these benefits requires further steps, and many labs are taking a fresh look at the glycocalyx as they learn more about its protective effects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research offers a view into how aging brains manage the delicate balance between being open enough for nutrients yet closed off from harmful factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By tuning that balance with added sugars, memory-related symptoms improved in mice. Studies are ongoing to see how much of that success will carry over to human patients, especially those with neurodegenerative conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08589-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2025 21:19:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxNc0ZKem42b0NMV21FNHJqQ09ETld0UTd4bmh6OEE3dU8xRlZnUXZ3LVJqY0Q4Q3l3Y0dmLVBZbHc3RFdZaFIwa2RHYzBpdXlXUkt3UGd2N0gwSG1Qd1BSLW8wMXkyYXRwQTRocVByUVFtbUM4aGhlY244bjNqdDB1Q2JDT3ZOZFY2ZUFBd0Rua3FrQmhoYnJDbTRFZUZnZ05jV1B0M09zSEhORFBLU1RXcw</guid></item><item><title>与语言相关的色彩知识-视觉大脑回路-神经科学新闻 | Color Knowledge Tied to Language-Visual Brain Circuitry - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE0zLVQzS1F2UXdiRGlJT05wUVVRZmFhbU04Z2VQeW5CUXBVaEQxd0FUVWlnQmZnd2wzSGRMTmZwcTdmWmx3Qnd6R1haYUt0MmFBVVY0a0JUSUZZV1NqQlJCQ2tJMHR2TjJudXdNMk5sQXZfdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study shows that our ability to recall details about familiar objects, like a banana’s typical color, depends on strong connections between visual and language-processing areas of the brain.&lt;/span&gt; Researchers found that stroke patients with disrupted neural pathways between these regions had weaker object-color knowledge and altered brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using fMRI and diffusion imaging, the team showed that the ventral occipitotemporal cortex (VOTC), which processes visual details, works in tandem with language areas like the anterior temporal lobe.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there’s evidence that parts of the brain involved in language, like the dorsal anterior temporal lobe (ATL), are also involved in this process — dementia patients with ATL damage, for example, struggle with object color knowledge, despite having relatively normal visual processing areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To understand whether communication between the brain’s language and sensory association systems is necessary for representing information about objects, the authors tested whether stroke-induced damage to the neural pathways connecting these two systems impacted patients’ ability to match objects to their typical color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They compared color-identification behavior in 33 stroke patients to 35 demographically-matched controls, using fMRI to record brain activity and diffusion imaging to map the white matter connections between language regions and the VOTC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that stronger connections between language and visual processing regions correlated with stronger object color representations in the VOTC, and supported better performance on object color knowledge tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These effects couldn’t be explained by variations in patients’ stroke lesions, related cognitive processes (like simply recognizing a patch of color), or problems with earlier stages of visual processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors suggest that these results highlight the sophisticated connection between vision and language in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors add, “Our findings reveal that the brain’s ability to store and retrieve object perceptual knowledge—like the color of a banana—relies on critical connections between visual and language systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Damage to these connections disrupts both brain activity and behavior, showing that language isn’t just for communication—it fundamentally shapes how sensory experiences are neurally structured into knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This work was supported by the STI2030-Major Project (https://en.most.gov.cn/, 2021ZD0204100 (2021ZD0204104) to Y.B.), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (https://www.nsfc.gov.cn/english/site_1/index.html, 31925020 and 82021004 to Y.B., 32171052 to X.S.W., 32071050 to X.Y.W.), and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (http://en.moe.gov.cn/, to Y.B.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this language and visual memory research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2c4e454340434b555c5e495f5f6c5c40435f02435e4b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Claire Turner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://plos.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PLOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Claire Turner – PLOS &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3003161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Object knowledge representation in the human visual cortex requires a connection with the language system&lt;/a&gt;” by Yanchao Bi et al. &lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Object knowledge representation in the human visual cortex requires a connection with the language system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How world knowledge is stored in the human brain is a central question in cognitive neuroscience.

A large-scale study found that depressive symptoms and loneliness increased long before pain onset, suggesting mental health may play a causal role in later physical discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, adults without pain showed relatively stable emotional well-being over the same period. These findings highlight the importance of early mental health and social support to potentially prevent or delay chronic pain, especially in vulnerable populations with fewer resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-Term Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Depression and loneliness worsened years before pain began in adults over 50.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unequal Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; The trend was strongest in people with lower income and education levels.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevention Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Early mental health and social interventions could reduce or delay pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UCL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Middle-aged and older adults who experience pain are more likely to have had worsening symptoms of depression up to eight years before the pain began, according to a new study by UCL (University College London) researchers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;eClinicalMedicine&lt;/em&gt;, suggests that among this age group, treatment for depression might help to prevent or reduce later aches and pains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers compared survey data from 3,668 adults aged over 50 who often experienced moderate to severe pain with a matched group of the same number who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110196"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows two heads and a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/depression-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers also investigated if there was a link between social isolation and experiences of pain but, unlike with loneliness, found little difference in social isolation between the pain and non-pain groups. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the pain group, they found that depressive symptoms got rapidly worse in the eight years prior to pain, peaked at the onset of pain, and remained high in the years after, whereas in the non-pain group depressive symptoms were less severe, less prevalent, and relatively constant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found a similar trend for loneliness, which increased both in the years before and years after the onset of pain but stayed low and relatively constant for those in the non-pain group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the cause of the pain was not identified, most participants said they had pain in the back, knee, hip, or foot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead author Dr Mikaela Bloomberg (UCL Epidemiology &amp;amp; Public Health) said: “Pain and depression are known to be linked, with each exacerbating the other. But we don’t know about the timing of these related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study shows that depressive symptoms and loneliness worsen long before pain begins. This is important as it suggests the potential for early mental health and social support to reduce or delay later pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Factors such as depression and loneliness can contribute to pain through several mechanisms. By inducing stress, they may increase inflammation, which can lead to pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They also may increase sensitivity to pain by changing immune responses and by dysregulating our autonomic nervous system, the network of nerves that control unconscious processes such as the ‘flight or fight’ response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings highlight the importance of approaching pain not just from a biological perspective. Mental health interventions may be important too.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study used data covering 21 years from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), in which a nationally representative population sample in England answers a wide range of questions every two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team found that the sharp increase in depressive symptoms among participants who experienced pain was larger among people with less education and wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is likely in part, the researchers said, because these individuals had fewer resources to support mental health and pain management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team said this finding pointed to the need to prioritise vulnerable populations with fewer socioeconomic resources with accessible mental health and community support programmes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also investigated if there was a link between social isolation and experiences of pain but, unlike with loneliness, found little difference in social isolation between the pain and non-pain groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas loneliness is a subjective feeling of lacking social connections, social isolation indicates objective lack of contact with friends and family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team suggested that the quality of relationships, rather than the quantity of relationships or levels of social interaction, may matter in terms of mitigating against pain and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three quarters of the study participants in the pain group reported experiencing pain in the back, knee, hip, or foot. Of those remaining, 1.9% reported pain all over, 0.5% reported mouth or tooth pain, and 20.7% reported pain elsewhere.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among study limitations, the research team noted that the participants were overwhelmingly white, reflecting the population of England in that age group. Future research, they said, should determine whether results are similar for younger groups and those with more racial and ethnic diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They cautioned that the survey data did not distinguish between pain and chronic pain. However, they had consistent results when they restricted the analysis to participants who reported pain in successive surveys two years apart, suggesting the findings applied to chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team adjusted for a wide range of factors that may have skewed the results – including participant sex, age, birth year, education, wealth, long term health conditions, physical activity level, alcohol consumption and smoking status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The researchers received funding from the Nuffield Foundation’s Oliver Bird Fund and Versus Arthritis.

We examined trajectories of these outcomes before and after pain onset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analysed data from participants aged ≥50 years from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA). Data collection began in 2002 (wave 1) and was repeated biennially until 2019 (wave 9); wave 10 took place in 2021/23. Participants who had data from at least 2 waves were included. Participants reporting pain between 2002 and 2023 (‘pain group’) were matched with an equivalent number without pain (‘no-pain group’; N = 7336 total).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychosocial outcomes were also assessed at each wave: Loneliness using the three-item subscale from the revised UCLA loneliness scale; social isolation using a score ranging from 0 to 5, with a higher score indicating more severe social isolation; and depression using the 8-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Piecewise linear mixed models were used to produce trajectories of loneliness, social isolation, and depressive symptom scores before and after pain onset and during the comparable time period in the no-pain group. Subgroup analyses examined how results differed by age, sex, education, and wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loneliness and depressive symptoms were more severe for the pain group than the no-pain group before pain onset (e.g., difference [pain-no pain] eight years before pain onset = 0.19 points, 95% confidence interval = 0.11–0.28 for loneliness; difference = 0.14, 0.06–0.22 for depressive symptoms). For loneliness, this difference increased consistently during the study period (e.g., difference = 0.33, 0.26–0.40 eight years after pain onset).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For depressive symptoms, the difference increased sharply to 0.58 (0.52–0.65) at pain onset and remained stable thereafter. Differences in depressive symptoms were most pronounced in less educated and less wealthy participants. There were negligible differences between pain and no-pain groups for social isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loneliness and depressive symptoms progressively increased in severity years before pain onset.
