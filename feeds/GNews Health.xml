Two children in Texas have died. Both children were unvaccinated and did not have underlying health conditions, according to Texas officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Measles is a highly contagious illness that can spread rapidly among unvaccinated people. The two-dose measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is 97% effective at preventing measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;Due to widespread vaccine uptake, measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000. Since then, there have still been outbreaks in communities with low vaccination rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt;The vaccine is recommended for nearly everyone, beginning at about 12 months of age. People who are pregnant or immunocompromised are not recommended to take the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-text-paragraph"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Dallas News</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 17:47:45 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi2wFBVV95cUxNYUtnMk9aQ3hhNDQxUGluVXNhbXBKbTVhc2psNzlGSUdqbzU2YXh1Vm9ZUnRYci1nS1RFd1AyWV9MeFlVVm1OVlNuZFA1R2FiT0Z1UE90QkJ4dkFSYXA2NGF2YjB3T1dtcGxVR2tyb0VuXzdlUEFVbnRxbG40ZTVkandvcVBQVzFvaWVjbWRTUktuQTRZZWZfUTZjOUpBSUFVQ05sQ2tGalJNR2YtY3c5MTZLSHU1eTV0WHpwQ0lQN2tmSGREWlZ4V0piZElxTlpGXzU5aGtYWWtEb2s</guid></item><item><title>我们分析了几十个冷冻披萨。以下是最健康的选择。-《华盛顿邮报》 | We analyzed dozens of frozen pizzas.

But many of them have a major downside: They’re ultra-processed. They’re frequently laden with salt, saturated fat, added sugars and industrial additives like artificial flavors, synthetic preservatives and emulsifiers. &lt;a href="https://cappellos.com/collections/pizza/products/uncured-pepperoni-pizza" target="_blank"&gt;Some popular frozen cheese pizza brands&lt;/a&gt; have nearly an entire day’s worth of saturated fat and 60 percent of your recommended daily sodium intake per serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-subscribe-cta" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="6SIFR3SHRNAF7O3SVP4ZSEFVPI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/06/27/ultra-processed-foods-predigested-health-risks/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies show&lt;/a&gt; that eating a lot of ultra-processed foods is associated with a higher risk of developing chronic diseases. Health experts say it’s a good idea to limit your intake — but that you don’t have to avoid them at all costs. For one, it’s impractical: Ultra-processed foods make up &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-024-01095-7" target="_blank"&gt;about 70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of all food items sold in grocery stores. And second, you can include some processed foods in your diet and still be healthy. That’s because they’re not all created equal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="GEVDYPIPVBGCJKK7QKBQL5VYTY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;We analyzed dozens of frozen pizza brands and discovered that some use mostly simple ingredients like wheat flour, tomato sauce, olive oil, garlic powder and mozzarella cheese, while others contain so many preservatives, flavor enhancers, emulsifiers and artificial ingredients that their ingredients lists can sound like a high school chemistry experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="VTXWDGJX5FHBTCQUH4P2ODSU3Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Here’s how to make frozen pizza a more nutritious meal, red flags to watch out for — and six of the healthiest pizzas we found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="VSD34QTGJVD2DMFEGOZL5GLOH4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="VSD34QTGJVD2DMFEGOZL5GLOH4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;How to make frozen pizzas healthier&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="LUNGQPEBSNH3NP6A6EAZ2SWG44" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You probably&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;shouldn’t eat frozen pizza every day, nutrition experts say, but it can still be part of a healthy, occasional lunch or dinner. The key is to purchase a quality brand and to make it part of a balanced meal, said Federica Amati, a medical scientist at Imperial College London and head nutritionist at Zoe, a&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;personalized nutrition company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="FKI4MZ37RJEV7NVDWJ3R7PKEYY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;You could steam some broccoli or chop up carrots and cucumbers to eat with your pizza. Maybe make a hard-boiled egg to go along with it. And have some fresh fruit, walnuts or mixed nuts at the end of your meal, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="24C5RPM4D5C73EF3KJSRJYG7PE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you want pizza with toppings, choose ones that have veggies such as onion, peppers, mushrooms and spinach. Or better yet, buy a Margherita pizza and add your own veggies at home. If you have kids, put some sliced veggies, corn and olives on the counter and let them choose their own toppings. Kids are more likely to eat veggies if you give them choices and involve them in the cooking process, Amati said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WLUI54CWI5A4VPGUUNEOB7GAVA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;If you want meat toppings, you should add your own — ideally things like grilled chicken or tuna. If you want sausage or pepperoni, buy them separately and look for the “uncured” versions that advertise low sodium and no added nitrates or nitrites. These two preservatives have been &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35303088/" target="_blank"&gt;linked to cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="S6ZCWRN6DBDTLPDHTIQVLYMOX4" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="S6ZCWRN6DBDTLPDHTIQVLYMOX4" data-testid="article-header"&gt;Look for these red flags on the label&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="P3EZN46IYFG5FH7C2OUMB37ERE" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;High sodium:&lt;/b&gt; Many brands of frozen cheese pizza contain high levels of sodium. It’s not uncommon to see brands that add salt to the crust, the sauce, the cheese and the toppings. We found that sodium levels in most brands of frozen pizza ranged from about 20 to 60 percent of the recommended daily limit for sodium intake per serving. Consuming a lot of sodium can increase your &lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/changes-you-can-make-to-manage-high-blood-pressure/shaking-the-salt-habit-to-lower-high-blood-pressure" target="_blank"&gt;risk of developing hypertension&lt;/a&gt; and heart disease. It’s best to look for brands that are relatively low in sodium — the less sodium the better.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Added sugars: &lt;/b&gt;Some brands add sugar into their pizza sauces and crusts. We found brands that had nearly a teaspoon of added sugar per serving or more. While it’s normal for pizza to contain some sugar — tomatoes naturally contain some sugar — you don’t need a lot of extra&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;sugar in your pizza. Look for brands that contain no more than one or two grams of added sugar per serving — or, ideally, no added sugar at all. Added sugars may be listed on food labels under names like dextrose, corn syrup solids, high fructose corn syrup, malt barley extract, sucrose and cane sugar.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Processed meats:&lt;/b&gt; Processed meats like pepperoni, sausage and bacon contain a lot of sodium, saturated fat and preservatives. &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34455534/" target="_blank"&gt;Studies have found&lt;/a&gt; that they increase your risk of developing multiple cancers, colorectal cancer in particular. For that reason, you should avoid buying frozen pizzas that have processed meats on them, Amati said. Processed meats are generally considered those that are smoked, cured, salted or that have had preservatives added to them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Industrial additives:&lt;/b&gt; Many frozen pizza brands use additives that have been linked to health problems. These include things like butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) — two synthetic preservatives that have been &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK590883/" target="_blank"&gt;linked to cancer in animal studies&lt;/a&gt;. Other additives to look out for are emulsifiers like &lt;a href="https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-020-00996-6" target="_blank"&gt;polysorbate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8539934/" target="_blank"&gt;carrageenan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004338" target="_blank"&gt;mono- and diglycerides&lt;/a&gt;, as well as industrial preservatives such as propylparaben and sodium nitrite. Pick frozen pizzas that contain mostly simple ingredients that you recognize and would use at home in your own kitchen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h2 id="QWNPHKNBBJA63OKBXQONE6LBMI" class="wpds-c-XIGbK wpds-c-XIGbK-iivLrAs-css headingStyleOverrides" data-apitype="header" data-contentid="QWNPHKNBBJA63OKBXQONE6LBMI" data-testid="article-header"&gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;Try these healthier frozen pizza brands&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="5KBIKC4WG5BMBGHIOWUEUFY2XQ" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amys.com/our-foods/cheese-pizza" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amy’s Cheese Pizza&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;: &lt;/b&gt;This frozen pizza has one of the simplest ingredients lists we could find. The primary ingredients are organic wheat flour, mozzarella cheese, organic tomato puree, organic extra virgin olive oil, and a variety of everyday spices and seasonings. The pizza is also relatively low in sodium, sugar and saturated fat compared to other brands.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://newmansown.com/product/harvest-vegetable-pizza/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Newman’s Own Thin &amp;amp; Crispy Crust Harvest Vegetable Pizza&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;: &lt;/b&gt;This is a good example of a frozen pizza that has recognizable ingredients that you’d expect to find in a home-cooked pizza, Amati said. It is relatively low in salt, sugar and saturated fat compared to other pizzas, and its ingredients list has no surprises. It contains simple things like wheat flour, whole oat flour, vegetable oil, olive oil, tomato puree, mozzarella cheese, red wine vinegar, garlic and other spices. Even better, it has a variety of nutritious toppings, including several vegetables.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatbanza.com/products/roasted-veggie" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Banza Roasted Veggie Pizza&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; This frozen pizza stands out because its crust is made from chickpeas. That means this pizza is gluten-free, and it also has significantly more fiber and protein than most other brands. One serving contains 10 grams of fiber. It also has 16 grams of protein — nearly equivalent to the amount of protein in three eggs. This pizza does have some additives, like tapioca starch and sunflower lecithin, but they are not considered harmful, Amati said. “Overall, this pizza has a nice combination of ingredients,” she added. “It’s a little more processed than the others, but it doesn’t have any ingredients that are high risk.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodnes.com/cpk-frozen/products/crispy-thin-crust-margherita-frozen-pizza/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;California Pizza Kitchen Margherita Pizza&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; One serving of this frozen pizza has 20 percent of your recommended daily sodium intake per serving, which is lower than most other brands we analyzed. It also has fairly high-quality ingredients, Amati said. It’s made from things like enriched wheat flour (flour that’s been fortified with iron and B vitamins), tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, fontina cheese, extra virgin olive oil, herbs, spices and baking powder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/product/whole-foods-market-mushroom-with-truffle-sauce-pizza-134-oz-b0cns3v1cm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whole Foods Market Mushroom with Truffle Sauce Pizza&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; The ingredients list for this white pizza is notably free of many of the synthetic or potentially problematic additives commonly found in frozen pizzas. The crust contains just five ingredients: wheat flour, water, extra virgin olive oil, salt and yeast. The toppings include recognizable ingredients like lemon juice, sunflower oil, portobello and cremini mushrooms, and mozzarella and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses. It has no added sugar, and&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;it’s relatively low in sodium and saturated fat compared to most other frozen cheese pizzas we looked at.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amys.com/our-foods/roasted-vegetable-pizza-vegan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amy’s No Cheese Roasted Vegetable Pizza&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; Finding a good-quality vegan or dairy-free frozen pizza is no easy task. That’s because many of them contain ultra-processed cheese alternatives that are made from coconut oil, xanthan gum and various emulsifiers and thickening agents. It’s better to buy a plain wheat crust and add your own tomato or pesto sauce and veggie toppings, Amati said. “As an Italian, I can tell you that pizza does not have to have cheese on it,” she added. Another option is to buy a “no cheese” frozen pizza like this one from Amy’s and add your own vegan cheese, preferably one that’s made from nuts instead of coconut oil and that doesn’t have a lot of additives, Amati said. One example of a vegan cheese with relatively good ingredients is Kite Hill’s dairy-free “&lt;a href="https://kite-hill.com/collections/ricotta-alternative/products/almond-milk-ricotta-alternative" target="_blank"&gt;Almond Milk Ricotta Alternative&lt;/a&gt;.” It’s made from just a handful of ingredients: almond milk (water, almonds) salt, enzymes cultures, and tartaric acid, a preservative that occurs naturally in grapes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HGTIXJI4XFFF3IDH6X7B6VHUW4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have a question about healthy eating?

The consistency stems from the fixed position of blood vessels under the skin, which constrict after prolonged immersion, creating the familiar loops and ridges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers tested the same fingers across multiple immersions and found near-identical wrinkle topography each time. The findings could have forensic applications, including identification of bodies exposed to water and new approaches in biometric science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repeatable Patterns:&lt;/strong&gt; Wrinkle topography stays consistent across water exposures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vessel-Based Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; Blood vessel constriction—not skin swelling—drives wrinkle formation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forensic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could aid in identification after water-related deaths.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Binghamton University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do your wrinkles always form in the same pattern every time you’re in the water for too long? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to new research from Binghamton University, State University of New York, the answer is yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, Binghamton University Associate Professor Guy German published research about why human skin wrinkles when you stay in the water too long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109871"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/water-winkles-forensic-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/water-winkles-forensic-neuroscience-300x207.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/water-winkles-forensic-neuroscience-770x532.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/water-winkles-forensic-neuroscience-293x202.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/water-winkles-forensic-neuroscience-150x104.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/water-winkles-forensic-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows wrinkled fingers." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/water-winkles-forensic-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/water-winkles-forensic-neuroscience-300x207.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/water-winkles-forensic-neuroscience-770x532.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/water-winkles-forensic-neuroscience-293x202.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/water-winkles-forensic-neuroscience-150x104.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;New research from Binghamton University, State University of New York reveals that wrinkle patterns on skin actually stay the same over time. Credit: Brenderous&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Received wisdom held that the water swelled your skin and made your fingers wrinkly, but little to no research had been done to prove that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What German and his team at the Biological Soft Matter Mechanics Laboratory found is that blood vessels beneath the skin actually contract after prolonged immersion, and that’s where the wrinkles come from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wrote about the research for The Conversation — a nonprofit news organization that asks academics to share their expertise on current topics — as part of its Curious Kids feature. One of the follow-up questions stumped him, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A student asked, ‘Yeah, but do the wrinkles always form in the same way?’ And I thought: I haven’t the foggiest clue!” said German, a faculty member at the Thomas J. Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science’s Department of Biomedical Engineering. “So it led to this research to find out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a paper recently published in the &lt;em&gt;Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials&lt;/em&gt;, German and Rachel Laytin ’23, MS ’24, show that, yes, the topography patterns remain constant after multiple immersions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Blood vessels don’t change their position much — they move around a bit, but in relation to other blood vessels, they’re pretty static,” German said. “That means the wrinkles should form in the same manner, and we proved that they do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research put subjects’ fingers in water for 30 minutes, taking photos and then repeating the immersion under the same conditions at least 24 hours later. By comparing the images, German and Laytin found the same patterns of raised loops and ridges after both immersions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also made an interesting side discovery: “We’ve heard that wrinkles don’t form in people who have median nerve damage in their fingers,” German said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One of my students told us, ‘I’ve got median nerve damage in my fingers.’ So we tested him — no wrinkles!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much fun as it was to figure out something a child asked, the research also could have real-world applications in forensics, such as fingerprinting at crime scenes and identifying bodies found after prolonged water exposure. German’s father, a retired U.K. police officer, faced some of these challenges during his law enforcement career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Biometrics and fingerprints are built into my brain,” he said. “I always think about this sort of stuff, because it’s fascinating.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;German is eager to further explore questions about skin immersion with his students: “I feel like a kid in a candy store, because there’s so much science here that I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We thank the people at The Conversation and the wonderful question they asked us, because does it create cool new science.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this forensic neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#472d25352f222b07252e29202f262a33282969222332" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;John Brhel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://binghamton.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Binghamton University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;John Brhel – Binghamton University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Brenderous&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmbbm.2025.106935" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;On the repeatability of wrinkling topography patterns in the fingers of water immersed human skin&lt;/a&gt;” by Guy German et al. &lt;em&gt;Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the repeatability of wrinkling topography patterns in the fingers of water immersed human skin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finger wrinkling during and after water immersion, often called pruning, is an evolutionary mechanism that increases grip strength in water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have determined that water-induced finger wrinkles result from vasoconstriction, or the tightening of blood vessels below the skin’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, no previous studies have characterized the morphology of topographical finger wrinkles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We anticipate that vasoconstriction also governs the morphology of finger wrinkles formed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since these constricting blood vessels are stationary, we expect the pattern created by topographical wrinkles formed to remain constant over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To evaluate pattern repeatability, images of human fingertips at two separate time points are overlaid and compared visually to establish corresponding wrinkle pairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wrinkle pairs are vectorized with orientation correlations evaluated quantitatively using normalized dot products, then compared against randomly oriented control vectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results demonstrate a significant relationship between wrinkle orientation across both time points and thus reveal the consistency of wrinkle morphology over time.&lt;/p&gt;

– are usually triggered by tree pollen in the spring, grass pollen in the summer and weed pollen in the fall. About 26% of adults in both countries have a seasonal allergy, as do about 19% of children in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2022/20220126.htm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the US&lt;/a&gt; and 10-15% of children in &lt;a href="https://www.allergyuk.org/about-allergy/statistics-and-figures/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;the UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a413c485-dd8e-4303-8eb6-86c93c16f978" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Pollen is everywhere.

These include decongestants, antihistamine pills, nasal sprays and eye drops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In order for these medications to work, says Bhasin, you have to be proactive and start your regimen at least two weeks before pollen season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="InteractiveBlockComponent" priority="critical" deferuntil="idle" props='{"url":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/","scriptUrl":"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js","alt":"Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’","format":{"design":10,"display":0,"theme":4},"elementId":"36b65e13-fcd2-4e11-908e-c6cee39d269e","isMainMedia":false}'&gt;&lt;figure id="36b65e13-fcd2-4e11-908e-c6cee39d269e" class="element element-interactive element--inline element-inline dcr-w422y2" data-alt="Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’" data-testid="interactive-element-Graphic%20with%20three%20lines%20of%20text%20that%20say,%20in%20bold,%20%E2%80%98Well%20Actually%E2%80%99,%20then%20%E2%80%98Read%20more%20on%20living%20a%20good%20life%20in%20a%20complex%20world,%E2%80%99%20then%20a%20pinkish-lavender%20pill-shaped%20button%20with%20white%20letters%20that%20say%20%E2%80%98More%20from%20this%20section%E2%80%99" data-spacefinder-role="inline"&gt;&lt;a data-name="placeholder" href="https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2023/10/archive-zip/giv-13425WMrLo2pc9VIk/" class="dcr-1eupayo"&gt;Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Bhasin notes that antihistamines can lose efficacy over time. If a medication “is not consistently controlling symptoms”, you “may have developed tolerance” to it, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Additionally, nasal sprays need to be used regularly to be of any help. Bhasin says she often sees patients discontinue using nasal sprays after three to five days because they don’t seem to be working, but it takes 10-14 days of consistent use for these sprays to reach maximum efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Experts caution that when overused, decongestants can cause a rebound effect, where nasal congestion &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/23393-rhinitis-medicamentosa" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;worsens&lt;/a&gt;. “Do not use them for more than three days,” says Carver, and check with your doctor before using if you have high blood pressure, heart disease, thyroid disease, glaucoma or trouble urinating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-18" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life&lt;/p&gt;&lt;gu-island name="SecureSignup" priority="feature" deferuntil="visible" props='{"newsletterId":"well-actually","successDescription":"Practical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good life"}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1eusqlu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Notice: &lt;/strong&gt;Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At home, keep windows closed and the air conditioning running so that clean air can circulate. Make sure to regularly change air filters as well. When pollen counts are especially high, Carver suggests wearing a mask outside. And always remove your shoes, shower and change into a fresh set of clothes when you get home, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="0ed6968a-29f2-44c8-9751-8936e272abfd" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":23,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Hay fever making your life a misery?

He explains that 'people tend to dream about things they desire or fear'. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, 'research has shown that dreaming and anesthesia produce different types of brain activity patterns.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A warning has been issued around popular drugs administered before surgery that can cause patients to suffer from disturbing and hyper realistic sexual fantasies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 40 million people &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14691117/Woman-horrified-tampon-stuck-inside-YEAR-infection.html"&gt;undergo surgeries worldwide&lt;/a&gt; every year, so medical experts worry that this phenomenon could cause lasting psychological damage to patients and have professional repercussions for medical staff, if they are wrongly accused of assault. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some studies even suggest that up to 18 percent of patients may have difficulty distinguishing between reality and fantasy during or after anesthesia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The most common drug used for general anesthesia during surgery is Propofol, due to its rapid effect and good recovery profile, meaning that it leads to a faster return to normal consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Wenk warns in a piece for &lt;a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/your-brain-on-food/202505/several-sedative-drugs-may-give-you-sexual-fantasies"&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/a&gt;: 'Health care professionals need to be aware of the &lt;a target="_self" href="/health/article-14668327/marriage-end-finasteride-effect.html" rel="nofollow" class=""&gt;potential risks to the patient&lt;/a&gt; and legal risks for themselves.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Wenk's concerns come off the back of research out of the University of &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/connecticut/index.html" id="mol-42cb55b0-2f70-11f0-be89-45a138d38e78"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, which looked at 87 cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study revealed that four in ten of the reported sexual fantasies were associated with benzodiazepines and 'dose played an important role'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The sexual hallucinations only happened when the two benzodiazepines - midazolam and diazepam - were administered in doses that were 'rather high'.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In another case, 110 dental surgery patients reported episodes of sexual visions or sexual arousal after being administered a 'standard cocktail' of drugs which included fentanyl, diazepam, and methohexital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the patients, Dr Wenk notes that the nature of the sexual episodes varied, with 60 percent reporting that their visions happened during their surgery, while 13.3 percent said they had sexual dreams after returning home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, around 10 percent of patients said that experienced 'unpleasant sexual hallucinations' while in the recovery room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers noted that with many of the cases of this phenomenon happening, the 'places of the body where procedures were conducted coincided with the area of the body where the patients perceived the sexual assault or fantasy occurred'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some people reported that their sexual hallucinations took a dark turn and these unpleasant visions linked to sexual assault were most associated with the use of ketamine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'One patient stated she would not undergo anesthesia again if ketamine was used,' Dr Wenk writes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The majority of patients who reported disturbing sexual visions were women, Dr Wenk notes, while men had more agreeable hallucinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Discussing this finding further, he told this website: 'The males in the study often had positive sexual fantasies that occurred more often when their therapist was female. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The females were more likely to experience hallucinations of sexual assault, especially if their therapist was a male (which was often the case). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Statistically, by middle age, most females are victims of some sort of sexual assault. Indeed, that experience might be the reason they seek our medical treatment and then are given one of these sedative hypnotic drugs.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Because of this difference between the sexes, the &lt;span&gt;University of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a target="_self" href="/news/connecticut/index.html" id="mol-42cb55b0-2f70-11f0-be89-45a138d38e78"&gt;Connecticut&lt;/a&gt; researchers deduced that males complained about their drug-induced fantasies less often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For instance, a high number of female patients - 12 percent out of 130 - undergoing anesthesia for procedures related to the reproductive system reported experiencing 'amorous or disinhibited behaviors while sedated'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers also found that the sex of the medical team also had an impact on patients having fantasies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Wenk notes that in one of the reports featuring 300 predominantly male patients who were admitted for urological procedures focused on the urinary tract and male reproductive system, 'none of them reported having a sexually related dream when the surgical team was all male'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, of 40 male patients who had female anesthesiologists, one of them reported having a dream about her during his procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In his piece for Psychology Today, Dr Wenk warns that benzodiazepines and propofol were not the only drugs that produced sexual fantasies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He concludes: 'Dopamine agonists, such as ADHD medications and stimulants, dopamine antagonists, such as antipsychotics, and some antidepressants have also produced sexual fantasies in some patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Dopamine-enhancing anti-Parkinson medications have been known to have a libido-stimulating effect in males.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, the researchers of the original study signed off with a caution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They wrote: 'While sexual assault hallucinations or fantasies associated with sedative hypnotics are rare, it is imperative that health care providers take the necessary precautions and follow recommendations to provide safety for themselves and their patients.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Wenk told this website that the current recommendation is for doctors to warn the patient that such an experience could happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, he notes that 'the risk for both patient and therapist is that by warning that a hallucination could occur it might make it more likely for the patient to experience one. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy due to the power of suggestion. Each therapist will have to decide which approach is best for their patient.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

These nodules, made of decayed sensory neurons and support cells, were found in abundance in the sensory ganglia of diabetic organ donors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study reveals that these structures not only signal nerve degeneration but may also drive pain by sprouting aberrant, pain-sensing axons. This discovery could shift how diabetic nerve pain is treated,  moving the focus toward early neuroprotection before these nodules form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forgotten Clue:&lt;/strong&gt; Nageotte nodules, long overlooked, are abundant in diabetic neuropathy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain Pathway:&lt;/strong&gt; These nodules contain sprouting axons likely involved in generating pain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Focus:&lt;/strong&gt; The findings suggest targeting early neurodegeneration could prevent nerve damage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UT Dallas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A phenomenon largely ignored since its discovery 100 years ago appears to be a crucial component of diabetic pain, according to new research from The University of Texas at Dallas’ Center for Advanced Pain Studies (CAPS).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Findings from a new study, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt; on May 5, suggest that cell clusters called Nageotte nodules are a strong indicator of nerve cell death in human sensory ganglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These could prove to be a target for drugs that would protect these nerves or help manage diabetic neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The key finding of our study is really a new view of diabetic neuropathic pain,” said Dr. Ted Price BS’97, Ashbel Smith Professor of neuroscience in the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences, CAPS director and co-corresponding author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We believe our data demonstrate that neurodegeneration in the dorsal root ganglion is a critical facet of the disease — which should really force us to think about the disease in a new and urgent way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diabetic neuropathy is one of the most common forms of neuropathic pain and affects about 11 million people — nearly one-third of the 38 million diabetics in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It typically affects the extremities, causing sharp, shooting pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Diabetic neuropathy can be debilitating,” said neuroscience research scientist Stephanie Shiers PhD’19, a co-corresponding author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109862"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a foot radiating red light, symbolizing pain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/neuropathic-pain-neurology-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;If that’s the case, the discovery could be an indicator of how to create treatment options. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Treatment options are not great, and if the underlying diabetes is not managed, people may require amputation due to damage to the peripheral nerves to the point of loss of sensation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With support from a Research Program Cooperative Agreement grant (U19) from the National Institutes of Health, Shiers and other scientists at CAPS are mapping human dorsal root ganglia and other sensory system tissue to understand human pain mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I found an abundance of these Nageotte nodules in a subset of the dorsal root ganglia recovered from organ donors. When I looked up the medical history on these samples, they were all from individuals with diabetes,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These nodules were more prevalent in people with diabetes and even more so in those with diabetic neuropathy. Organ donors die from a range of conditions, so discovering these abnormalities in a large subset of the tissue with a similar medical history was a big break.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nageotte nodules are dead sensory neurons that have decayed, and what remains is a cluster of non-neuronal cells. They were first documented in 1922 in rabbits by the French neuroanatomist Jean Nageotte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past 100 years, these nodules have been almost entirely ignored in the research literature, only appearing in about 20 papers, many of which are a half-century old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They appear to be a sign of degeneration where hyperglycemia reduces neuron viability,” Shiers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Little has been documented about these structures’ molecular composition. Virtually nobody in the pain field had heard of them, and we knew almost nothing about their involvement in pain and neurodegeneration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, Shiers and her colleagues sought to characterize Nageotte nodules at the molecular level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using histology and spatial sequencing, they demonstrated that Nageotte nodules are abundant in sensory ganglia of those with diabetic neuropathy. They are mainly composed of satellite glia and non-myelinating Schwann cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Intertwined with the nodule is a bundle of axons: fibers of sensory neurons that look like little neuromas. The axons there appear to sprout from sensory neurons; they are pain-sensing fibers,” Shiers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This appears to be a unique pathology — something never described before in humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that’s the case, the discovery could be an indicator of how to create treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Spontaneous activity in these fibers may be what’s behind diabetic neuropathy,” Shiers said. “We also had several donors with other types of neuropathic conditions that weren’t diabetes-related, and their DRGs also had an abundance of Nageotte nodules.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the rare earlier papers mentioning Nageotte nodules are mostly case studies of single individuals, this study had samples from 90 people. Shiers said her documentation of axons sprouting in this manner is also novel — another aspect of this study that represents new territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This could change our basic understanding of sensory neurons. Sensory neurons are not supposed to sprout fibers from their cell bodies; they have a unique shape that we call pseudounipolar, but these diabetic sensory neurons do not look pseudounipolar — they look multipolar.” Shiers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know if this morphology is pathological or if we have lacked understanding of these cells in humans.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers can study human dorsal root ganglia from such a large selection of patients due to the work of the Southwest Transplant Alliance, a nonprofit organization that recovers donated organs and tissues for transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The ability to give life to others through research is incredibly important to our donation community,” Southwest Transplant Alliance President and CEO Brad Adams said. “Knowing that your loved one’s gift led to incredible medical discoveries and advances such as this brings hope and healing to all who have lost a loved one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price said, “The entire study would never have happened without them. This partnership is the most important thing that enables this work.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price said the research has led to new ways of thinking about neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In my view, one of the most important insights we gained from this work is thinking about treating diabetic neuropathic pain differently. I think what we need to focus on now is neuroprotection at early stages of disease so that these Nageotte nodules do not form in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other UT Dallas-affiliated authors from the Department of Neuroscience include Dr. Gregory Dussor, the James Bartlett Chair in Behavioral and Brain Sciences and department head; Dr. Diana Tavares Ferreira, assistant professor; research scientists Andi Wangzhou MS’15, PhD’21, Dr. Joseph Lesnak and Ishwarya Sankaranarayanan PhD’22; doctoral student and former Green Fellow Khadijah Mazhar BS’17; and research assistant Nwasinachi Ezeji BS’20, MS’22.

thanks to a combination of missed testing, treatment and prenatal care gaps, substance use, social stigma, and testing delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2023, the US reported nearly 4,000 cases of congenital syphilis, up more than a third from 2021 and 10 times higher than a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were also 279 congenital syphilis-related stillbirths in 2023, the highest number reported in 30 years.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-6130401/US-health-officials-beg-doctors-screen-pregnant-women-syphilis.html"&gt;2018 federal recommendation&lt;/a&gt; urged all pregnant women to be screened for the disease, but the USPSTF is emphasizing its importance by reissuing this recommendation given the upticks in cases and still births. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women are already recommended to get screened from the disease early, at their very first visit with a gynecologist weeks of pregnancy - between eight and 12. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Women are recommended to get screened from the disease early, at their very first visit with a gynecologist weeks of pregnancy - between eight and 12. This applies to women who have been previously tested for syphilis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the UPSTF also recommended screening at 28 weeks' gestation and a third time at delivery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Revealing the guidance, members of the task force said: '[We] conclude with high certainty that screening for syphilis infection in pregnancy has a substantial net benefit.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They added: 'Rates of new syphilis cases have continued to rise over the past three decades, especially in women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Although men account for the majority of syphilis cases, the change in incidence among women was 2 to 4 times higher than that among men between 2017 and 2021.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Congenital syphilis can cause severe long-term problems for the baby. They may be born too early, too small, or stillborn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Newborns with the infection can have life-threatening complications such as severe anemia, swollen liver and spleen, yellowing skin (jaundice), and bone deformities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The infection can also cause brain and nerve damage, leading to inflammation of the covering around nerves, blindness, and permanent hearing loss.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The USPSTF said: 'A recent analysis of national data from 2022 found that 5 percent of congenital syphilis cases (197/3761 cases) occurred in late pregnancy after having had a negative syphilis screening result earlier in pregnancy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In 2023, states and DC reported nearly 4,000 cases of congenital syphilis. This marks a 3 percent rise from 2022, following a 32 percent surge from 2021 to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Similar to the disparities seen in the burden of syphilis, 40.6 percent of these cases occurred in Black women, 28.4 percent occurred in Hispanic or Latina women, and 19.8 percent occurred in White women.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some retrospective studies estimate that 25 percent to 50 percent of congenital syphilis cases could be prevented by repeat screening in the third trimester of pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The task force added: Congenital syphilis increased more than 10-fold over a recent decade, from 334 cases in 2012 to 3882 cases in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is estimated that almost 90 percent of new congenital syphilis cases could have been prevented with timely testing and treatment.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The infection can be cured in utero with consistent treatment with the antibiotic penicillin, ideally before the second trimester. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A 2014 systematic review of 54 observational studies found that the incidence of congenital syphilis, preterm birth, low birth weight, stillbirth, and newborn infant death was dramatically reduced in pregnant women treated for syphilis during pregnancy compared with those who had untreated syphilis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Screening for congenital syphilis involves a blood test that detects antibodies that may reflect infection with Treponema pallidum, the organism that causes syphilis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Most states mandate screening for syphilis in all pregnant women at the first prenatal visit, and some mandate repeat screening early in the third trimester and at delivery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;During pregnancy, the body goes through many changes that can sometimes cause false positives on syphilis screening tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These tests look for signs of tissue damage, not just syphilis itself. Pregnancy can trigger similar reactions because of hormonal shifts, immune system adjustments, or other conditions like autoimmune diseases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A positive result on the first test doesn’t always mean syphilis—it needs a second, more specific test to confirm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The infection is spread through contact with fecal matter. Unhoused people are more likely to experience the dangerous infection given lack of easy access to handwashing and public restrooms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Infection is also more common in women living in areas where cases are generally high, those with a history of HIV, incarceration, or sex work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Clinicians should be aware of the prevalence of syphilis infection in the communities they serve and state mandates for syphilis screening,' the task force said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

It's amazing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Jackie's mother and sister both had breast cancer.  She has three daughters and the eldest, Danielle, also carries the inherited BRCA gene mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"For my future generations, if they have got the BRCA gene, it is a new hope," Jackie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Around one in 400 people carry mutations in either the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Cancer Research UK estimates about seven in 10 women with changes in these genes will develop breast cancer, compared to about one in seven women without these mutations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;For men with BRCA mutations, the risks of developing breast cancer are much lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Olaparib is the first targeted drug treatment for cancers with mutations in the BRCA genes and is given as a tablet. It works by stopping cancer cells from being able to repair their DNA by blocking a protein called PARP, which causes the cancerous cells to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The trial, named Partner, took place at 23 sites in England, Scotland and Wales. Before surgery, 39 women with early stage breast cancer were given olaparib, also known as Lynparza, together with chemotherapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;They started olaparib tablets 48 hours after each chemotherapy infusion. After three years, all had survived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;By contrast there were six deaths among 45 women in the study who received chemotherapy before surgery but did not get olaparib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof, Jean Abraham, a consultant at Addenbrooke's and professor of precision breast cancer medicine at the University of Cambridge, who led the trial, described the results as were "really exciting". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;"It is rare that you see 100% survival at 36 months for this subtype of breast cancer.  We're incredibly excited about the potential of this new approach."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;The findings have the potential to be applied to other BRCA-related cancers, such as ovarian, prostate and pancreatic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 dEGcKf"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 hxuGS"&gt;Prof Abraham said a larger, multinational trial is planned next year, involving some 600 patients.

            Hot flashes and night sweats. Light, heavy or skipped periods. Mood swings and brain fog. Sleepless nights. Changes to hair and skin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmtqa9000i3b6mm8jr2v2i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These can all be symptoms of the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/10/health/menopause-women-midlife-hormones-wellness/index.html"&gt;menopause transition&lt;/a&gt;, a natural process that a woman&lt;s&gt; &lt;/s&gt; goes through as her brain and body wind down and eventually shut off the ability to reproduce.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmtqa9000j3b6m94tudloj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But honest and open discussions about menopause and the years leading up to it — called perimenopause — have, until recently, been nonexistent. Women’s experience  have been either ignored or superficially played out in public for laughs, often resulting in a shroud of secrecy and feelings of shame.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmtqa9000k3b6mb9rcyr9m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Treating menopause as taboo even made the process a mystery to the very people going through it.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmtqa9000l3b6mimcocytk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When I first started to notice changes in my body, I was probably … 46, 47-ish,” Emmy-award winning comedian and writer Samantha Bee told CNN Medical Correspondent Meg Tirrell&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;recently on the podcast Chasing Life With Dr. Sanjay Gupta. “And I was starting to do my own show. ‘Full Frontal’ had just kind of started, and I was under just … immense amounts of stress, no question.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmtqa9000m3b6mn957dgdp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And I really started to feel like I was not coping well,” she said. “My body was changing — I was having physical changes — and I actually, literally didn’t know what was happening.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmtqa9000n3b6m1fpjg359@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Bee, who rose to fame first as a correspondent on “The Daily Show With Jon Stewart” and later with her own series, “Full Frontal With Samantha Bee,” said she would stop getting her period for a couple of months here and there. Her hair also started falling out in a way that didn’t feel typical. And she developed frozen shoulder, started sweating at night and was on an emotional roller coaster with her insides “roiling.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmtqa9000o3b6m4kxbjn35@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because the majority of her friends are a little younger than she is, Bee said she thought she was “going crazy” because of her job.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmtqa9000p3b6mts1ck2o9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She finally confided in her gynecologist that she wasn’t sleeping well and “turning into Lady Macbeth.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmtqa9000q3b6m5vsiy9he@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “And she was like, ‘Oh, you’re in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/30/health/perimenopause-menopause-wellness/index.html"&gt;perimenopause&lt;/a&gt;.’ And I was like, ‘There’s a word?’” Bee recounted, noting that at the time the topic hadn’t really broken the surface of popular culture.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmtqa9000r3b6mem1oa7fg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We’re all talking about it now, and you can read about it, and people are like, ‘Yeah!’ But eight years ago: zip, like zero information,” she recalled. “Nobody in the conversation. Not cool. Very unsexy. Mention it and you are just like a witch-crone who lives in a cave, don’t come out. … I would never in a million years have thought, ‘Oh, I’m in perimenopause.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Bee’s most recent project, “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Audible-Studios-on-Brilliance-Menopause/dp/B0DXQJNDTR" target="_blank"&gt;How to Survive Menopause&lt;/a&gt;,” was born out of her own bewildering experience. She performed her one-woman show in New York City in October 2024, where it was recorded live and adapted for audio by Audible.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Having a word and a framework for what she was going through, Bee said, helped put her “on a path of knowledge.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz5400123b6mhimivt11@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “You’re de-pubertizing,” Bee said. Her doctor had this helpful guidance: “‘Remember all the torment you felt … when you were 15 and … every zit was an operatic tragedy? She was like, ‘That’s what that is, but just in the other direction.’”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz5400133b6mtuvjcoug@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The No. 1 thing that helped Bee most, she said, “is that you have to find a community of people that you can talk to, even if it’s just one person.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz5400143b6mc9mheev1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Just saying the words out loud and  normalizing it. It’s normal. It literally happens to 50% of the population,” she said. “It’s good to make a joke about. It’s good to say  it out loud. That’s actually the main thing that has helped me.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz5400153b6myh178k7w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            What was not helpful, she said, was turning to social media. “I don’t like to take advice from people who are trying to sell me any type of product. Ever.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz5400163b6miqry9oe6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whom did Bee trust? For advice and guidance, in addition to her own doctor, she turned to a woman who has been called “the internet’s gynecologist,” Dr. Jen Gunter. Gunter, who authored the best-selling “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Menopause-Manifesto-Health-Facts-Feminism/dp/0806540664/ref=sr_1_1" target="_blank"&gt;The Menopause Manifesto: Own Your Health With Facts and Feminism&lt;/a&gt;,” is known for debunking myths about this stage of life.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz5400173b6mida9d7mo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “She told me that some of what happens when you are in perimenopause is that your brain is creating new neural pathways because it’s kind of cleaning itself out,” Bee said. “It’s kind of scrubbing out all of the neural pathways related to getting pregnant, feeding a baby, all of those early childhood, maternal pathways in your brain. It clears a little bit of space so it can be a time of tremendous creativity.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz5400183b6mffxj8wtl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Gunter, who said she likes to call it the “menopause experience” or the “menopause continuum,” agreed that we don’t talk enough about perimenopause and menopause.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz5400193b6mw2fc8qtm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If you’ve never heard about it, how would you really know what’s going on with your body?” she told Tirrell&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on a separate episode of the Chasing Life podcast.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalnhfyb00003b6mm6axkyjv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/html-embed/instances/cmalmxi23001k3b6mqyyrk4ow@published" class="html-embed" data-editable="settings" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
    
&lt;/p&gt;


    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz54001a3b6mmc81mngf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “A lot of women get their symptoms dismissed,” she said. “But also, the symptoms can be really nonspecific.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz54001b3b6mebx4a3o5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For example, she said, women can have irregular periods, heavy bleeding, hot flashes and brain fog for other reasons. “So, there’s a combination of reasons that a lot of people don’t realize that’s what it is until they’re in the middle of it.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz54001c3b6myocs9k0p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;How &lt;/em&gt;menopause is discussed in the wider culture can also be impactful.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz54001d3b6mcj2n1g27@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “How you talk about something actually changes your thoughts about it,” Gunter pointed out.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz54001e3b6mykargdqa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It means that we have a mind-body experience,” she said. “Everybody around you is telling you that you’re an ugly old hag whose ‘time has come,’ and all you’re seeing are 70-year-old men dating 20-year-old girls. … You could see how someone would feel worse about maybe the changes happening to their body.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmwz54001f3b6mhhfeaxto@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Gunter said we speak in euphemisms about men. “They have ‘erectile dysfunction.’ We don’t say ‘penile failure,’” Gunter said. “If we talked about men’s bodies the way we talked about women’s bodies, &lt;em&gt;woof&lt;/em&gt;, that would be a whole different ball game.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmy05t001n3b6mfao7k1hd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So, what do women need to know about the menopause experience? Here are Gunter’s top five facts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1ro001s3b6mzbxz6gg4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Menopause marks the end of an individual’s reproductive years. The ovaries cease releasing eggs. “This is when ovulation stops,” Gunter said via email. “This means estrogen levels eventually decrease, and production of progesterone stops.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1ro001t3b6m5f7kxj57@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the progress is not gradual or linear. “Hormones can be chaotic in the time leading up to menopause, which is known as the menopause transition.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1ro001u3b6mbhzeg32d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Remember the chaos of puberty? “Think of menopause like puberty in reverse,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1ro001v3b6math2djrm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/menopause/what-menopause" target="_blank"&gt;menopause transition typically starts&lt;/a&gt; at the average age of 45, according to Gunter. “The average age of menopause 51 and the normal range is 45-55.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1ro001w3b6m3j4mhtk9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This means for some women symptoms may start in their early 40s, but for others there may be no symptoms until their late forties or even early 50s,” she added via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1ro001x3b6mv4wm2601@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In other words, everybody is different, which makes it  an unpredictable ride.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1ro001y3b6mh3s418hm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Gunter explained that an individual reaches the milestone of menopause when she has not had a period for one year. “Menstrual irregularity is normal in the menopause transition, and when people are reliably skipping a period then menopause is likely 1-3   years away,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1ro001z3b6mvpz09a22@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            No blood or urine tests exist that can indicate whether someone is close to menopause, according to Gunter. Blood work isn’t even needed for the diagnosis. “If you are over age 45 and have gone a year without a period, that makes the diagnosis,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1ro00203b6m1v8eakpu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But sometimes more testing is required. “Blood work is indicated if someone is younger than age 45 and going 3   months or more between periods. The reason for the testing is to identify the cause of the irregular bleeding, and one cause may be premature menopause (age 40-  44) or primary ovarian insufficiency (under age 40),” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1ro00213b6mxwi3srv5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For people who don’t get their periods for other reasons — due to using a hormone IUD or having had a hysterectomy — Gunter said doctors go by symptoms other than bleeding, for example hot flashes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmalmz29s002l3b6m06oy1y9g@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="symptoms-and-medical-concerns" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Symptoms and medical concerns
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1ro00223b6mfgyd1b2e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Symptoms can vary greatly from person to person, affect many body systems, and start and resolve at different times.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1ro00233b6m40umc9a7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The most  common symptom in the menopause transition is irregular periods, but they can also be heavy,” Gunter said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1rp00243b6ma4fa435s@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Everyone is different. Hot flashes and night sweats are common symptoms,” she noted. “Depression, brain fog and joint pain can happen as well. Vaginal dryness, pain with sex and an increased risk of urinary tract infections are also common concerns.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1rp00253b6mlwejqoui@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Menopause also ushers in some physical vulnerabilities. “The risk of osteoporosis increases with menopause. Menopause also marks a time when there is a change in the risk of diabetes and heart disease, so it’s important to be checked for diabetes, have your blood pressure checked and also your cholesterol and lipids,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1rp00263b6m4y3wr8qn@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The best therapies for you will depend on your symptoms and health risks, Gunter said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1rp00273b6mj1xk4jea@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/in-depth/hormone-therapy/art-20046372" target="_blank"&gt;Menopause hormone therapy&lt;/a&gt; (also known as hormone replacement therapy) is the gold standard for hot flashes and night sweats, and for women who choose this therapy, it should be an FDA-approved product,” she said via email. “Hormone pellets and compounded hormones are not FDA-approved and not recommended    as the dosing is inconsistent and can lead to unnecessary and serious health concerns.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1rp00283b6mtp28zr0y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Many women have heard the word bioidentical, but it is a marketing term. That being said, women should know that most hormones approved by the FDA are bioidentical,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1rp00293b6mfqyzh17t@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Should all women entering menopause be on it? “We do not recommend that every woman take menopause hormone therapy, rather (that)   it be prescribed for specific reasons where we have data to show it works or that is biologically plausible that it could help,” Gunter explained.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1rp002a3b6m37wtyvfk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            There are several key lifestyle opportunities as well, Gunter said, such as not smoking and eating a balanced, healthy diet.  She recommends aiming for 25 grams of fiber every day.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1rp002b3b6mvmqncaa8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s also important to do resistance training and do aerobic exercise, as this improves many health domains,” she said, noting, however, that there is no need to go overboard   by, say, running marathons or engaging in competitive weight lifting if you don’t already enjoy these activities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1rp002c3b6mssz5pm89@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To maintain physical fitness, aging adults can follow the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/physical-activity-basics/adding-adults/what-counts.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines&lt;/a&gt; of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity weekly and two days per week of muscle-strengthening activities of moderate intensity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1rp002e3b6mye4n5ob3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There are no menopause-specific supplements that have been shown in rigorous studies to help with symptoms. Considering the menopause gold rush, I recommend people steer clear of those who sell supplements    as their content online is almost always geared for sales, not education,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1rp002f3b6mi4w4ayjw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But if a person has a specific health concern, such as low iron or low vitamin D levels, Gunter said in the podcast, a supplement can be of value. Look for one that has been certified by a third party, such as &lt;a href="https://www.usp.org/dietary-supplements-herbal-medicines" target="_blank"&gt;US Pharmacopeia&lt;/a&gt; (USP) or the &lt;a href="https://www.nsf.org/consumer-resources/articles/supplement-vitamin-certification" target="_blank"&gt;NSF&lt;/a&gt; (the National Sanitation Foundation).
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmalmz1rp002g3b6mpd8abm7y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

The adverse effects on quality of life appear to be amplified by dysfunctional efforts to manage the intense emotional dysregulation associated with ADHD under the influence of alcohol. The research was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022395624007143"&gt;Journal of Psychiatric Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcohol use disorder is a chronic condition marked by an inability to control alcohol consumption despite harmful consequences, resulting in significant distress or impairment. It involves a pattern of excessive drinking, strong cravings, and a loss of control over alcohol intake. Individuals with this disorder often experience withdrawal symptoms such as tremors, anxiety, and nausea when not drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The severity of alcohol use disorder can range from mild to severe, depending on the number of symptoms present. Over time, it can lead to serious health problems, including liver disease, cardiovascular complications, and cognitive decline. Social and occupational functioning often deteriorates as individuals begin to neglect responsibilities and relationships due to their drinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study author Amandine Luquiens and her colleagues aimed to examine how alcohol use affects quality of life in individuals with ADHD. In particular, they focused on the roles of impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies in this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity that interfere with daily life. It typically begins in childhood but can continue into adulthood, affecting academic, occupational, and social functioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed data from the beginning of the TRAIN study, a clinical trial in France investigating the efficacy of a cognitive training program for patients with alcohol use disorder. The sample included 206 individuals diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, 40 of whom also had ADHD. All participants were classified as being at high risk due to their drinking levels—defined as consuming over 60 grams of alcohol per day for men and over 40 grams per day for women during the previous four-week period. At the time of the study, participants had been abstinent for between 7 and 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants completed a series of assessments measuring ADHD symptoms (using the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale), health-related quality of life specific to alcohol use disorder (using the Alcohol Quality of Life Scale), impulsivity (using the Impulsive Behavior Scale), emotion regulation strategies (using the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire), emotion regulation difficulties (using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale – Impulse Control Difficulties subscale), and alcohol-related cognitive impairment (using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that alcohol use had a greater negative impact on quality of life in individuals with ADHD compared to those without the disorder. Participants who were highly impulsive or who had difficulties with emotional regulation tended to report lower quality of life as well. Individuals with ADHD were more likely to suppress emotional expression, which was associated with further declines in quality of life. Overall, the researchers concluded that dysfunctional efforts to cope with emotional dysregulation significantly contributed to reduced well-being in individuals with ADHD and alcohol use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings have direct clinical and therapeutic implications. They underscore the relevance of identifying patients’ preferred emotion regulation strategies and the need to work with them on the limits of expressive suppression in the context of ADHD in AUD [alcohol use disorder], and on more functional and less costly alternatives,” the study authors note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study sheds light on the specificities of the relationship between alcohol use and quality of life in individuals with alcohol use disorder who also suffer from ADHD. However, it should be noted that the design of the study does not allow any causal inferences to be derived from the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The paper, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2024.12.012"&gt;ADHD and alcohol: Emotional regulation efforts pay off in quality of life points,&lt;/a&gt;” was authored by Amandine Luquiens, Thibault Mura, Alexandra Dereux, Patrice Louville, Helene Donnadieu, Marie Bronnec, Amine Benyamina, Pascal Perney, and Arnaud Carre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 14:01:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxPNFFsZWZVUnBUQ1gxc3VzaUJWWWk3dHJaTjFSNWptaHVfWDhGdU9MZFUteFpLanR0TW8tN0QwSmVMaXB6cVNrVUVETHBUWGdaVk1DbmYyY2dfTjhrN1J1WTNTVE9LSlhDbE5zanl3T3RNV2RaY0hRRWdSQUxKTHVIUm8wMFhKcU5sUVZoNHBnYnZFXzgwZ3ZLckZB</guid></item><item><title>睡眠呼吸暂停随着时间的推移侵蚀记忆-神经科学新闻 | Sleep Apnea Erodes Memory Over Time - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZEFVX3lxTE1jaU9LYjg4WTBpNDNIZlBqWUhWT2xOMi1ucUFObFl5TU5id05OM252bThxQmJzOThFYUY1UVJsd1BrTDlwRGlTRmVQWnUwa0lmdlp1OVNGN2JLdlA3UVZMWUhNSFk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) contributes to significant memory decline, especially in visual and verbal working memory, according to a new review of human and animal studies. Key features of OSA, intermittent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation, drive brain inflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal injury, impairing memory and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The severity and duration of OSA correlate strongly with worse memory performance, with biomarkers like the Oxygen Desaturation Index offering measurable insight. While CPAP remains the frontline treatment, researchers call for better diagnostics and emerging therapies to address this underrecognized cognitive impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biological Damage:&lt;/strong&gt; OSA triggers neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and synaptic dysfunction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive Correlation:&lt;/strong&gt; Memory impairment severity correlates with OSA intensity and duration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Gaps:&lt;/strong&gt; CPAP helps but new diagnostics and therapies are needed for full cognitive protection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Marshall University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), commonly associated with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, also plays a significant but less recognized role in memory decline, according to a new review published in &lt;em&gt;Sleep Medicine Reviews&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from the Marshall University Joan C.

Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;They report that key features of OSA—intermittent hypoxia (IH) and sleep fragmentation (SF)—trigger biological processes such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, neuronal injury, altered synaptic plasticity, and blood-brain barrier dysfunction, all of which contribute to cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disease severity and duration are strongly linked to poorer memory performance, with measures like the Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) correlating with the extent of impairment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy remains the most effective treatment for protecting cognitive function, the authors stress the need for additional therapies and more precise diagnostic tools to identify and manage OSA-related memory dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early changes observed through brain imaging, EEG, and blood biomarkers may serve as emerging predictors of cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The review was co-authored by Drs. Xiaoman Zhang, Huajun Xu, and Shankai Yin of Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and Drs. David Gozal and Abdelnaby Khalyfa of Marshall University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Zhang completed a six-month research scholar program in Khalyfa’s lab at Marshall University, collaborating with Khalyfa and the team to develop this review article. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors also highlight future research directions, including the role of gut microbiota, genetic factors, and epigenetic changes in OSA-related memory decline. They suggest that multidimensional clinical profiling could support the development of personalized treatment strategies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People’s Republic of China (STI2030-Major Projects 2021ZD0201900), the National Institutes of Health (HL166617, HL169266), and the Joan C.

                                        minutes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="articleContainer"&gt;&lt;p&gt;MURRAY — Ann Itchon says she will never forget the sound of her husband falling in the bathroom the night he suffered a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 23, 2024, Ted Itchon woke up around 2 a.m. to use the bathroom and lost his balance, causing him to collapse onto the floor. Ann found him quickly after and called 911. She says she had no idea what was wrong until she overheard a paramedic saying Ted might be having a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time it took Ann Itchon to leave their house and meet her husband at the hospital emergency room, first responders had already assessed Ted and provided him a stroke-stopping medication that prevented further damage to his brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Paul Johnson, medical director of the Comprehensive Stroke Program at Intermountain Medical Center, and the neurologist who treated Ted Itchon that night, explained that medical staff work as fast as possible when treating a stroke patient because, for every second they are experiencing a stroke, 32,000 neurons in the brain die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A stroke is a very time-sensitive disease. When somebody is having a stroke, it's just a matter of time until you have a permanent brain injury," said Johnson. "We often say, in the stroke world, that 'time is brain.' Every minute you delay care, it costs brain cells. The sooner somebody comes into the hospital, the sooner we can intervene and prevent that injury from happening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utah was recently ranked as the top state for providing the fastest stroke treatment in the nation by the American Heart Association, according to &lt;a href="https://news.intermountainhealth.org/new-report-finds-utahns-getting-fastest-stroke-treatment-in-nation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Intermountain Health.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Heart Association recommends that patients receive a tissue plasminogen activator medication to dissolve blood clots in the brain within 60 minutes of arriving at the hospital. In Utah, 87.1% of stroke patients received the medication within 45 minutes of their arrival, making it the only state in the country reaching that goal for over 85% of patients. Furthermore, Intermountain Health reports 94.5% of patients arriving at its stroke centers receive the medication within 45 minutes, and 88% receive it in 30 minutes or less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To improve its door-to-needle time, Johnson says Intermountain Health has implemented changes such as having the blood clot-dissolving medication premixed, expediting CT scans, and improving the emergency department workflow overall. The health care system also has a stroke neurologist on staff 24/7 to ensure patients can be diagnosed and treated as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have been able to treat patients very quickly because we — along with our sister hospitals in the state — have focused very intensely on assessing patients, when they come to the hospitals, as quickly as possible," said Johnson. "We have worked very closely with EMS crews, with the ER doctors, with our nurses in the ER, to make sure that we shave off every minute that we can ... so that when a patient like Ted comes in, we are very quickly able to get the data that we need."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a patient arrives at the emergency room, medical staff must be able to determine definitively that the patient is having a stroke before administering the medication to stop it. They also need to verify the patient's medical history and what medications they may be taking to ensure nothing will interfere with the stroke treatment medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Ted Ichton's case, doctors also had to perform a thrombectomy, or surgical procedure to remove blood clots from arteries in the brain, in addition to administering the tissue plasminogen activator medication. Because his specialized stroke team was able to move so quickly in treating him, Ted Itchon says most people he meets don't even know he suffered a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can't tell you how much I appreciate the doctors. They were fantastic, and I enjoyed them, even though I wanted to get out (of the hospital). I don't even know how to explain the gratitude I have," he said. "If it wasn't for Ann and her diligence, her quickness of calling 911, I would probably be less than what I am now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ted Itchon was able to return home just four days after his stroke. While he still required outpatient physical therapy sessions to help him recover some speech skills and treat his foot that was affected by the stroke, Johnson says Ted Itchon experienced a relatively speedy recovery thanks to the quick door-to-needle time he received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typically, a stroke occurs when a blood clot blocks an artery, preventing blood flow and oxygen delivery to the brain, which can result in the death of brain cells. Strokes are most common in older adults — especially those with high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes — but can happen to anyone, according to Johnson. As strokes are the fifth-leading cause of death in the U.S., he encourages people to be informed so they can help themselves or loved ones suffering from a stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We always like to remind people that we use the mnemonic device BEFAST to remind patients and the public what to look out for for a stroke: sudden severe balance problems, eye problems — so vision loss on one side or the other — facial droop, arm weakness, speech problems .. and then 'T' is time, so time to call 911 and time to come in and seek treatment," said Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After calling 911, Johnson says one of the best things a loved one can do to expedite the door-to-needle time for someone suffering from a stroke is to know what medications they take and be prepared to provide their medical history. Most stroke patients are unable to speak clearly or coherently, so having a family member or friend's number to contact for information can help first responders and hospital staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, prevention can be the best medicine for some stroke patients, according to Johnson. While not all strokes are preventable, 80% are if patients receive treatment for conditions that make them higher risk for stroke, like high blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes and smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on stroke risk or recovery, visit the American Heart Association's &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;stroke website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

But, there may be some variance in that based on your stride, says &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/natalyavasquezcoaching/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Natalya Vasquez;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Natalya Vasquez&lt;/a&gt;, CPT, a certified personal trainer, health coach, and founder of Bridal Bootcamp San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, how long it will take you to get in this many steps is also pretty individualized: “If you’re walking at a moderate pace of approximately 3.0 mph, or 20 minutes per mile, it would take approximately one hour and 40 minutes to walk five miles, but if you walk at a faster pace of 4.0 mph or approximately 15 minutes per mile, it would take approximately one hour and 15 minutes to walk five miles,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is 10,000 steps even a magic number or nah?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Short answer: Not really. But it takes some explaining. The recommendation originated from a Japanese company’s 1960s marketing campaign for their pedometer, says Vasquez. “The name of their pedometer translated into ‘10,000 steps,’ and at the time, there was no research to substantiate the claim that 10,000 steps was the gold-standard, but they simply set a higher bar for their population to encourage healthier behavior,” she says. (The translation was actually '10,000 step meter' and WH took a deep dive into the &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a62598280/accidental-step-count-scam/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:10,000 steps myth;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;10,000 steps myth&lt;/a&gt; if you're interested in joining us in this rabbit hole.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's absolutely not up for debate is that &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62007446/can-walking-keep-you-fit/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:walking is great exercise;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;walking is great exercise&lt;/a&gt; for anyone with lower-body mobility since it’s low-impact and can be easily modified with speed and intensity, says Vasquez.

Break up your step goal throughout the day and go for small 15- to 20-minute &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a64526723/is-walking-enough-to-count-as-a-workout/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:walks;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;walks&lt;/a&gt; when possible to make it less daunting, says Vasquez. Whether you pace while on a work call, walk your dog around the block, or park further away from the store, get creative with your steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Clifton

naturally occurring compounds called flavan-3-ols – found in cocoa, tea, apples and grapes – may improve blood pressure and the health of blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The research, published in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology, analysed data from 145 randomised controlled studies, and found that regular consumption of flavan-3-ols can lead to a reduction in blood pressure readings, particularly in people with elevated or high blood pressure. In some cases, the average blood pressure-lowering effects were comparable to those seen with some medications.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Flavan-3-ols were also found to improve the function of the endothelium - the inner lining of blood vessels - which is crucial for overall cardiovascular health. This improvement occurred independently of blood pressure changes, suggesting a broader positive impact on the circulatory system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="in-article-image" data-mod="image" data-orientation="landscape" data-tmdatatrack="inline-widget" data-tmdatatrack-articleid="31509875" itemprop="image" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Professor Christian Heiss, lead-author of the study and Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at the University of Surrey, said: "The findings are encouraging for those looking for accessible ways to manage their blood pressure and support their heart health through enjoyable dietary changes. Incorporating small amounts of commonly consumed foods like tea, apples, dark chocolate, or cocoa powder into a daily balanced diet could provide beneficial amounts of flavan-3-ols.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“While not a replacement for prescribed medications or medical advice, including more flavan-3-ol-rich foods in a daily routine could be a valuable addition to a healthy lifestyle, especially for those with higher blood pressure. These are findings that, although promising, require ongoing investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 11:46:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihAFBVV95cUxPMGtGNVc3OXFpdVZ5TXktcXNVYl9KMHRjOW4tV0FRblFhYkU1TlhtY2RDOEppLUR3RlE3SVZZUFAtdXYtX3FhU0NId1FJY2RFNDdBN3h1THVHcXVKYTdpZEpobHpBY0c0Vl9Xb1hYdHRDc21yYU9ucWV6Y0lraVZ4NUtNMzc</guid></item><item><title>肺癌：一项研究发现我们的盘子上有一个意想不到的杀手！ -银河日报 | Lung Cancer: A Study Uncovers an Unsuspected Killer on Our Plates! - The Daily Galaxy</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxPajNyeVBHb0Z2TFliR2hwTjQ5OVJvb2t6ZUxjMlprSHZQdHRvNnVrWlFuWWs0SERaRDFwWXUtQ2Jrb1VmNkVvZ0NiOVV3MEdLbElOZHpwZ3pLcDRuY0kzNmMzYXo4S3lIZE9XLXJJaHltTFVQSDJsZzVsejNvck85WFRNNGNRcm1JbmNmVmF5RVlqQjlOZU9KejY0SmxCUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent study has uncovered an unexpected connection between our diets and the progression of &lt;strong&gt;lung cancer,&lt;/strong&gt; specifically a common type known as&lt;strong&gt; pulmonary adenocarcinoma (LUAD)&lt;/strong&gt;. While smoking and environmental factors have long been linked to the disease, this new research shines a light on a surprising dietary factor that could contribute to the growth of lung cancer cells. The study points to &lt;strong&gt;glycogen&lt;/strong&gt;, a molecule typically associated with energy storage, as a potential culprit in accelerating the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;

    
    &lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="1096651400" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
    
    
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Glycogen Accumulation in Lung Cancer Cells&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The groundbreaking study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-025-01243-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Nature Metabolism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, was conducted by researchers at the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the &lt;em&gt;University of Florida&lt;/em&gt;. The scientists focused on &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/01/what-happens-to-body-after-7-days-fasting/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="76020" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;glycogen&lt;/a&gt;, a form of glucose stored in the body as an energy reserve. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Their findings revealed that &lt;strong&gt;glycogen accumulates in large amounts in the tissues of patients with LUAD&lt;/strong&gt;, and the presence of higher glycogen levels was linked to faster tumor growth. The researchers used &lt;strong&gt;spatial metabolomics&lt;/strong&gt;, an advanced technology that allows for the mapping of molecules directly within tissues, to study the effects of glycogen on lung cancer cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;The accumulation of glycogen appears to play a critical role in the development of LUAD, acting as a fuel source for the cancer cells. The more glycogen present, the more aggressive the tumor growth becomes. This discovery points to a potential new area for research, suggesting that glycogen could be a factor in how the disease progresses, beyond the well-known environmental risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Role of the Western Diet in Cancer Growth&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study also highlights the influence of the &lt;strong&gt;Western diet&lt;/strong&gt;, which is typically rich in fats and sugars, on the growth of lung cancer. In a series of experiments, the researchers fed mice a diet high in fats and sugars, mimicking the eating habits common in Western countries. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results were striking: the mice with elevated glycogen levels in their lung tissues showed &lt;strong&gt;significantly faster tumor growth&lt;/strong&gt; compared to those with lower glycogen levels. This experiment suggests that the excess sugars and fats in the diet may contribute to the buildup of glycogen, which in turn accelerates the development of LUAD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4349301016" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;These findings point to an alarming possibility: the foods we eat may be acting as a fuel source for cancer cells, particularly in lung cancer. As glycogen is found to be more abundant in the lungs of cancer patients, the connection between diet and disease progression becomes increasingly evident. This study underscores the importance of considering diet as a factor in cancer development and progression, adding a new dimension to our understanding of lung cancer risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Glycogen as a Biomarker for Lung Cancer&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to its role in cancer progression, glycogen could become a useful &lt;strong&gt;biomarker&lt;/strong&gt; for monitoring the development of LUAD. By tracking glycogen levels in lung tissues, doctors could potentially assess the severity of the disease and even predict how quickly a tumor might grow. This opens the door to more personalized and effective treatment options, as doctors could tailor interventions based on the glycogen levels in a patient’s tumor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, if glycogen proves to be a reliable marker, it could serve as a new target for &lt;strong&gt;therapeutic interventions&lt;/strong&gt;, providing a way to slow or stop tumor growth. The ability to monitor glycogen levels could also lead to more accurate predictions regarding patient outcomes and the efficacy of various treatments. Researchers are now exploring whether reducing glycogen in the lungs could help slow the progression of lung cancer, offering hope for more targeted therapies in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Implications for Lung Cancer Prevention&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings of this study also have significant implications for &lt;strong&gt;public health strategies&lt;/strong&gt; aimed at preventing lung cancer. Just as anti-smoking campaigns have successfully reduced lung cancer rates, promoting healthier dietary habits could be a critical step in reducing the risk of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Public health initiatives could focus on educating the public about the impact of high-sugar and high-fat diets on lung cancer, encouraging healthier eating habits as part of an overall cancer prevention strategy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study suggests that encouraging people to adopt healthier eating habits, particularly by reducing their intake of sugars and fats, might help lower the risk of developing LUAD. As our understanding of diet’s role in cancer progression deepens, we may see public health campaigns shift to include dietary advice as a key component in the fight against cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

Learn a new skill (that you enjoy)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Keep your brain active by doing the things that you enjoy doing,” recommends Schott. “I’ve previously said, ‘If you hate Sudoku, don’t do Sudoku’ as you’re not going to stick with it.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It’s more about finding whatever keeps you engaged and stimulated, he emphasises.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“For some people, that’s reading a book, for others it will be playing chess or learning a new skill like crochet,” says Schott.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Learning a new skill, or getting better at a pre-existing one, helps keep your brain flexible, explains the neurology professor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What we think is, when you learn new skills, those areas [in the brain] get connected better together and the connections get stronger – that’s why when you repeat a skill over and over and over again then that movement becomes more automatic,” says Schott. “And we think that it probably makes the brain a bit more resilient.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Do something active every day&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I think exercising is the single best thing that we can do,” says Schott. “We talk at Alzheimer’s Research UK about what’s good for your heart is good for your brain, and that’s because lots of the risk factors for your heart are also risk factors for brain diseases as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Exercise can lower your blood pressure, can lower your cholesterol, can take your weight down and gives you a sense of wellbeing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Ideally, you want to be doing a little bit of exercise every day and want to be doing something that gets your heart rate substantially elevated for at least 20 minutes three or four times a week.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There is also growing evidence that suggests exercise can buffer some of the effects of the causes of dementia in the brain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The mechanisms aren’t entirely clear, but it’s likely that the chemicals that get released from the muscles get into the brain and may actually alter this,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Go on regular walks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“What’s really interesting is that it does not need to be hugely vigorous exercise,” says Schott. “We’re not talking about running marathons, we’re talking about walking every day or walking up the stairs rather than taking a lift.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Some of the research that we’ve done suggests that it’s actually relatively small but sustained amount of activity throughout your life, that may be the most beneficial.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walking with others also offers additional valuable social benefits, and Alzheimer’s Research UK is set to host a variety of Walk For A Cure events across the UK this summer – ranging from family-friendly, accessible 5km routes to more challenging 42km hikes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Stay connected&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Several studies also suggest that social isolation can raise the risk of dementia, so staying connected with others is a powerful way to support your brain health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Do things that you really enjoy doing yourself, but also with other people,” recommends Schott. “Staying connected helps you keep in touch with people, you get feedback on people and you can also compare how your brain performance is to other people’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“When I have someone who says to me, I’m a bit worried about my memory, my immediate thought is to say what’s your memory like compared to those people you hang out with?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Get your blood pressure checked&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Keeping an eye on your blood pressure is really important,” says Schott. “We and others have found that it’s your blood pressure in your 30s and your 40s which actually may have the most impact on your brain health.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The professor explains that monitoring blood pressure is important because dementia generally stems from two main causes: neurodegenerative diseases and cerebrovascular disease, with the latter involving damage to the brain’s blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“By reducing the blood pressure, we think we’re probably putting less strain on the blood vessels in the brain, which makes them more robust and less likely to get clogged or less likely to burst,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. Complete Alzheimer's UK’s Think Brain Health Check-in&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I would suggest that everybody does our Think Brain Health Check-in,” recommends Schott. “It’s been used by over half a million people in the UK, and you can go in and you can put in your own personal circumstances, and it’ll ask you questions about things like exercise, smoking, diet and alcohol, and will come up with some easy-to-follow advice.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Join Alzheimer’s Research UK this summer with the return of Walk For A Cure, a series of accessible, 5km, nationwide walking events.

This gene, carried by the likes of Avengers star Chris Hemsworth, has been linked to a ten-fold increased risk of Alzheimer’s &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those with more sedentary time were more likely to experience Alzheimer’s symptoms - regardless of how much they exercised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also saw greater reduction in the size of their hippocampus, part of the brain  crucial to memory and learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While this area shrinks normally as we age, this process accelerates among those with Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These results were observed despite almost nine in ten completing the 150 minutes of recommended exercise per week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientists found the risk posed by sedentary time was particularly high for those with the APOE-e4 gene, a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;APOE-e4 is carried by about one in 50 people, including the likes of Avengers star &lt;a target="_self" href="/tvshowbiz/chris_hemsworth/index.html" id="mol-2e9ee890-0b9a-11ef-9f23-932e8e66cb04" class=""&gt;Chris Hemsworth&lt;/a&gt;, and has been linked to a ten-fold increased risk of Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The authors suggested those with the APOE-e4 gene may want to take extra measures to reduce their sedentary time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia. The disease can cause anxiety, confusion and short-term memory loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lead author Dr Marissa Gogniat said the results demonstrated the importance of avoiding sitting for long periods, even if you are otherwise fit and active.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Reducing your risk for Alzheimer’s disease is not just about working out once a day,' she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Minimising the time spent sitting, even if you do exercise daily, reduces the likelihood of developing Alzheimer’s disease.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Angela Jefferson, fellow author and expert in neurology, added: 'This research highlights the importance of reducing sitting time, particularly among ageing adults at increased genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It is critical to our brain health to take breaks from sitting throughout the day and move around to increase our active time.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;While the study cannot pinpoint exactly how time spent sitting increases Alzheimer's risk, they posed a theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Being sedentary for long periods may disrupt the healthy flow of blood to the brain, and over the long term this could lead to structural changes in the organs that contribute to Alzheimer's. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Around 900,000 Britons are thought to have the memory-robbing disorder. But University College London scientists estimate this will rise to 1.7million in two decades as people live longer. It marks a 40 per cent uptick on the previous forecast in 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A recent analysis by the Alzheimer's Society estimated the overall annual cost of the dementia to the UK is £42billion a year, with families bearing the brunt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An ageing population means these costs – which include lost earnings of unpaid carers – are set to soar to £90billion in the next 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 944,000 in the UK are thought to be living with dementia, while the figure is thought to be around seven million in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's is thought to because by a toxic build-up of proteins in the brain, which clump together to make it harder for the organ to work properly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The brain struggles to cope with this damage and dementia symptoms develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Memory problems, thinking and reasoning difficulties and language problems are common early symptoms of the condition, which worsen over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Alzheimer's Research UK analysis found 74,261 people died from dementia in 2022 compared with 69,178 a year earlier, making it the country's biggest killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 11:14:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxPQy1GREVkdWpCdFJGajlQdE9LTXVXQnNaTWNHTFc1VzJoTUFWMkpXRGtGU3RhTjB6MWJzdkFaR093ODJQTHNBUmpqZTJsZ2ZTQUhFQUFZOThyTEoxT0gzS0RWal9OajItbnFveHI4RWZqOWotQ1ZWQUlFTXdTWTdaZEoxWldGUTB4YXhCblZxa0FXRnk0d2txNm5aa3JaS3AzMFhaSmVFTC1rcmc4TmfSAbMBQVVfeXFMUEZBdnIxUWhORlpsSkhlUF90cVJCNmlqV19xQ2xvYXI0UlJvbkVka1ZVX3FFTklfOF9iVlZzdUNuZ19ITm1mUm5FVF9ZXzlFcmRBcHVpNGNkRjNJQ0lJN19ZTnJfdHVXSFdLMWFMYXlnU012RXdMSmNKdUVqMUtvSTlPVUM0dUN2V0Q1S2dqYjBMUHRCal9IM2RhdHNOT3BDTExVSUZRY1VnN251b0lEd0ZJakU</guid></item><item><title>为什么我们都不能拥有Zofran ？ - The Cut | Why Can’t We All Have Zofran? - The Cut</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxNNDZELTB3MFJGeUlOOGI2Vm9nRGNXUmlKdzBfZUdHd0pJMjdCdndPb2xkMGNicjVXVF9PWUdOR2VyNVFlU3RyTWFKQzItakVqQjF1cUw3MWg1ZzY4cTV0Q1Q0UEZqNFF2MFdxRVU3ZzJpN1lUSkY3TTdZSy0tWWE3QlFTLWFJQlI4Vjl3YU1n?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="wwwthecut-zephr-anchor" class="article-content feature" data-editable="content"&gt;

My friend Laura says her husband keeps a stockpile for his &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/article/does-eating-chocolate-actually-trigger-migraine.html"&gt;migraines&lt;/a&gt;. Liz does, too, as well as Meaghan, who also uses it for vertigo. Emma used it to curtail a bout with &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2016/02/being-sick-with-a-baby.html"&gt;norovirus&lt;/a&gt; this winter, and is “guarding the remainder of the prescription like it’s solid gold.” Leah tells me, “I have the teeniest dose always on hand for my 6 ½ year old who gets carsick—we refer to it as her ‘magic pill.’” Eva says she’s been “a Zofran girlie since 2013,” popping it whenever nausea rears its queasy head. “ I used it for &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2023/12/morning-sickness-hyperemesis-gravidarum.html"&gt;pregnancy&lt;/a&gt;,” she continues, “but I also used it recently when I was feeling slightly off and had dinner reservations at this amazing restaurant and didn’t want to throw up.” Ashley Grady, who I found deep in an Instagram comment section, says she’s used the drug near-daily for fifteen years to manage the nausea that arises from Crohn’s disease. “It’s a godsend,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmah0df44001c3b771x236j6k@published" data-word-count="208"&gt;It’s not surprising that people would welcome a drug that so seemingly miraculously makes the agony of nausea disappear. Often taken as a dissolving capsule placed under the tongue (it’s tough to swallow a pill when you can’t keep anything down), Zofran, the brand name for ondansetron, is both quick and effective, all but eliminating nausea in as little as &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/zofran/how-long-take-zofran-work"&gt;thirty minutes&lt;/a&gt;. A&lt;a href="https://go.drugbank.com/drugs/DB00904"&gt;pproved by the FDA in 1991&lt;/a&gt; for use in patients undergoing chemotherapy or surgery, it’s changed the game for chemo-induced nausea, with one &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10701260/#:~:text=Ondansetron's%20safety%20profile%20and%20well,Rao%20and%20Faso%2C%202012)."&gt;study’s&lt;/a&gt; authors calling it a “necessary medication” in a cancer patient’s arsenal. But as the aforementioned applications of the drug make clear, there are countless off-label uses, too. Zofran makes a stomach virus tolerable, reducing not only discomfort but also dehydration. The drug is a boon for those who are pregnant, hungover, or living with Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome. (&lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cyclic-vomiting-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20352161"&gt;Yes, that’s a thing&lt;/a&gt;.) Grady tells me that because Zofran helps her live with Crohn’s, she can eschew other medications for the condition, such as “steroids and biologics and immunosuppressants.” She explains, “as long as I’m able to manage my nausea, I’m saving my kidneys, I’m saving my liver. I’m saving myself 30 pounds of weight that being on Prednisone my whole life gave me.”&lt;/p&gt;

(If people have this condition congenitally, it may be exacerbated by Zofran). Dr. Camille Thélin, an associate professor in the University of South Florida’s division of digestive diseases and nutrition, explains that in QT prolongation, “the interval between heartbeats is longer than normal, which causes the heart to beat irregularly.” This type of arrhythmia is called &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21915-torsades-de-pointes"&gt;Torsades de Pointes (TdP)&lt;/a&gt;; it’s a rapid and unpredictable heart rhythm with a mortality rate of between &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/cardiovascular-medicine/articles/10.3389/fcvm.2022.966331/full"&gt;10 and 20 percent.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Many of these drugs also prolong the QT interval, but others impact the body’s serotonin receptors, just as Zofran does. Simultaneously taking Zofran and, say, a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor, or SSRI (the medication class of antidepressants like Prozac and Zoloft) could result in a condition known as Serotonin Syndrome. If it’s severe enough and left untreated, it can be fatal &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33196298/"&gt;within 24 hours&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s hard to say, says Thélin, because “we all have a different liver makeup based on our genetics. Some people might be fast metabolizers or slow metabolizers, and that can really change the level of serotonin in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;

When you use multiple medications with the risk of prolonging the QT, it raises the hairs on the back of my neck.” Some &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK553159/#:~:text=Prochlorperazine%20and%20chlorpromazine%20are%20dopamine,antiemetic%20and%20migraine%20relief%20effects.&amp;amp;text=Most%20antiemetics%20used%20for%20migraines,prolongation%20and%20torsades%20de%20pointes."&gt;migraine medications&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.oatext.com/QT-prolongation-by-ranitidine-in-hypokalemia-and-arrhythmogen-provoked-rat-heart.php#:~:text=Currently%20there%20are%20more%20than%2050%20non%2Dcardiac,associated%20with%20case%20reports%20of%20arrhythmia%20[10]."&gt;antibiotics&lt;/a&gt; are known to prolong the QT interval, as well as certain OTC drugs, including &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534864/#:~:text=Many%20commonly%20used%20medications%2C%20such,remains%20unknown%20with%20these%20medications."&gt;Benadryl&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.okosteo.org/assets/120VAC/Presentations/Saturday/1000%20-%20Drug-Induced%20QT%20Prolongation.pdf"&gt;Pepcid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s conceivable that Zofran could help a doctor-wary sufferer retreat into denial.&lt;/p&gt;

But from there things get more complicated, and more subjective.&lt;/p&gt;

Fejzo’s research focuses on women’s health, with a particular interest in &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12232-hyperemesis-gravidarum"&gt;Hyperemesis Gravidarum&lt;/a&gt; (HG), a condition during pregnancy that causes almost incessant nausea and vomiting, sometimes for the pregnancy’s full duration. I had just told her that the gastroenterologists I’d spoken with had highlighted the risks of making Zofran too accessible. She does not hold back in her disagreement. “If doctors were more willing to prescribe this drug for women to help them during pregnancy, then my answer would be different,” Fejzo says. “But it’s withheld in so many cases because of this fear of adverse outcomes. I think it would be great to have it available and let women make their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; choice about it.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmah0dg16001p3b77wvj5yftl@published" data-word-count="206"&gt;Fejzo&lt;a href="https://time.com/6691524/marlena-fejzo-3/"&gt; herself suffered from HG&lt;/a&gt;, so wracked by her symptoms that she was bedridden and had to receive nourishment first intravenously, then via feeding tube. Ultimately, she miscarried—an outcome that, along with preterm birth, she tells me occurs in 1 in 3 cases of HG. Fejzo says she was dismissed by her doctor, who implied that she was exaggerating her symptoms. This attitude is not uncommon among physicians, Fejzo says. “It’s rooted in historical sexism,” she continues. “I got a recording of an OBGYN, a woman doctor, teaching her medical students that when women are hospitalized with hyperemesis, it’s usually because there’s something going on at home or because they just don’t want to get better. Those were her exact words. She’s repeating this misogynistic nonsense to the next generation of medical students, and they believe her, and it just gets perpetuated.” It’s this attitude that may be what keeps Zofran out of the hands of the pregnant people who need it, Fejzo says: If a doctor doesn’t believe your symptoms are real, they’re unlikely to prescribe you a drug to cure them. Fejzo tells me she has seen cases in which wanted pregnancies were terminated because the HG symptoms were simply too much to bear.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmah0dg4u001q3b7741gz5n4u@published" data-word-count="98"&gt;Hoping to counteract the misconceptions about Zofran’s risks in pregnancy, Fejzo conducted a &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27151373/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;. “We compared people who took Zofran who had HG to people who did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; take Zofran and had HG, and then we had controls who did not have HG,” she says. “The risk of adverse outcomes was increased in people with HG compared to the people who did not have it, but the risk was identical for people who had HG whether or not they took Zofran.” In other words, it’s not the drug that’s dangerous to a fetus, it’s the condition it treats.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmah0dg6n001r3b77x9s60wsl@published" data-word-count="171"&gt;Fejzo believes that the tendency she’s observed for physicians to withhold Zofran from those with HG comes down to a paternalistic belief that women can’t evaluate the drug’s risks on their own and weigh them against the benefits. (This is not dissimilar to the &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/women-and-pain-disparities-in-experience-and-treatment-2017100912562"&gt;demonstrated underprescribing&lt;/a&gt; of pain medication to women, who are more likely to be given sedatives than painkillers as compared to their male counterparts.) Case in point, Fejzo says, is research that found a miniscule increase in oral clefts of the fetus among pregnant subjects who took Zofran. “The increased risk is tiny. Eleven out of 10,000 people who did not take Zofran during pregnancy got an oral cleft in their fetus versus 14 out of 10,000 among those who did take it. So, there were only three more out of 10,000, which is a way lower risk than, for example, the risk of miscarrying after an amniocentesis, which is one in 200 to one in 400. Yet doctors allow women to make that choice all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmah0dg8w001s3b771rkkdbg9@published" data-word-count="178"&gt;I also spoke with Dr. Nicholas Ghionni, a Baltimore-based pulmonologist who works in the ICU. He had commented on an Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/rubin_allergy/reel/DEllts3RPnw/?hl=en"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; regarding the dangers of Zofran by Dr. Zachary Rubin, the doctor behind @rubin_allergy, an account with 1 million followers. The post explored the QT interval and Torsades de Pointes concerns, with countless people ringing alarm bells in the comments. “I take this medicine every single morning,” one person wrote. “Now I’m freaked out.” Another said, “I had no idea. I thought it was safe.” But Ghionni’s retort called for a dose of perspective. “Torsades was seen in patients who took massive doses in a chemo study (32 mg at a time),” he wrote; the standard dosage for run-of-the-mill nausea in adults is far lower, around 4 milligrams. “Furthermore,” Ghionni continued, “how does this matter if you go to your PCP and get Zofran and then go home? You’re not on continuous monitoring.” In fact, in his daily work in the ICU, Ghionni tells me, he doesn’t bother with heart monitors for a low dose of Zofran.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmah0dga9001t3b77tsu0m0qk@published" data-word-count="155"&gt;“Medicine is very dogmatic,” Ghionni says. “And all of these rules are hammered into you as an intern—one of which is ‘Zofran causes QT prolongation, be careful.’” To Ghionni, this is just an echo of how medicine has always operated: Everyone practices in the way they’ve been taught to, until “people come along and challenge the dogma and ask, okay, do we have &lt;em&gt;evidence&lt;/em&gt; of harm or benefit?” Zofranophobe doctors might start by reading the actual &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-new-information-regarding-qt-prolongation-ondansetron-zofran"&gt;FDA warning&lt;/a&gt; attached to the drug, because Ghionni’s comment was correct about the discrepancy between the standard dose of 4 milligrams of ingested Zofran and the 32 milligram intravenous dose that was was associated with prolonged QT. Per that warning, the 32 milligram dose should be “avoided,” but there’s no risk mentioned regarding the far lower doses of Zofran that most people receive. So why, Ghionni wonders, should Zofran be, “picked out as the bad boy on the block?”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmah0dgbn001u3b77agoz8kyk@published" data-word-count="173"&gt;Which brings us to a glaring logical flaw in the prescription-only side of the Zofran debate: Ondansetron is arguably no more dangerous or prone to side effects than any number of OTC medications. Take  acetaminophen (aka Tylenol) for example, too much of which can cause &lt;a href="https://www.drugs.com/acetaminophen.html"&gt;a rare fatal skin reaction and liver failure&lt;/a&gt;, or cough syrups with &lt;a href="https://oxfordtreatment.com/substance-abuse/hallucinogens/dxm/"&gt;Dextromethorphan&lt;/a&gt;, which is hallucinogenic in high doses and famously prone to abuse. “I totally get why people say, yes, Zofran should be available, and others say, no, it shouldn’t be available,” says Deutsch. “I tend to argue that things like Advil and Tylenol shouldn’t be so readily available over the counter, even though they’re likely safe in most cases.” She thinks it all comes down to timing, and the way the FDA has changed its approach to regulation over the years: “It’s very, very, very infrequent that you see a new medication regulated by the FDA available over the counter anymore. If Zofran had been around 20 or 30 years earlier, it probably would’ve been OTC.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="clay-paragraph" data-editable="text" data-uri="www.thecut.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cmah0dge4001v3b77iy1b2vex@published" data-word-count="215"&gt;Deutsch also taught me an industry term: &lt;em&gt;therapeutic misadventure&lt;/em&gt;. It refers to adverse effects  stemming from the attempt to address a medical problem—and, in this context, to the ways in which the average person consumes medications they don’t realize are dangerous. “You’re trying to treat your pain or nausea,” Deutsch says, offering a hypothetical. “You take one pill, and it helps a little but you’re still in discomfort, so you think,&lt;em&gt; wouldn’t a second pill help more?&lt;/em&gt; It makes perfect sense, except that with medications, more is not necessarily better.” It’s easier to make OTC medication mistakes than you may realize, and every year, roughly &lt;a href="https://ph.health.mil/topics/healthyliving/asm/Pages/OverCounter.aspx"&gt;178,000 people&lt;/a&gt; wind up in the hospital for this reason. A Zofran misadventure doesn’t seem outside the realm of possibility; if you’re nauseous, you’re distracted. Did you take the last dose two hours ago, or three? You took it in tablet form, then threw up—do you take it again? You skipped a dose because you felt okay, but now you’re queasy. If the directive on the package is to take no more than 24 mg per day, and you’d still be below that threshold, can you take two? The point is, it’s easy to get lost in the nuances, and hidden in all that medicine minutiae are opportunities for mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

No, probably not.&lt;/p&gt;

Is it kept from patients because of sexism, or inflated fears, or dogmatic thinking, or because it was created thirty years too late? It’s hard to say. But the case for OTC ondansetron is compelling. Prolonged QT intervals are rare, as is Serotonin Syndrome. The FDA could require, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/information-drug-class/legal-requirements-sale-and-purchase-drug-products-containing-pseudoephedrine-ephedrine-and"&gt;as it does for cold medicines containing pseudoephedrine&lt;/a&gt; (a key ingredient in methamphetamine), that Zofran only be sold in limited doses to those able to present a government ID. And anyway, as Fejzo points out, even in hospital settings there’s often not as much attention paid to arrhythmia-related concerns as you might think. “Even when Zofran is prescribed,” Fejzo says, echoing Ghionni, “are people on it being monitored? Are they checking their hearts? No, I doubt it.” A Reddit &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1hvfwam/if_the_concern_for_ordering_zofran_is_prolonged/"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; from late last year in r/nursing suggests not: “When I worked med/surg, we gave [Zofran] to almost everyone who needed antiemetics and we didn’t need the patients on tele or EKG to do so”—meaning nurses were not asked to monitor patients’ heart rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmalci399001b3b76zhft9uut@published"&gt;My wife and I (we’re both women) want to start a family and have approached a good male friend as a sperm donor. Happily, he agreed. However, going the artificial insemination route is expensive, so we are going to use the turkey baster method. When I told my sister, she was aghast and said it was a terrible idea. Even worse, she told our mother (without my consent), who in turn told my aunts, cousins, and grandmother, and now they’re all up in arms! How do I put this fire out?&lt;/p&gt;

You just allow them to be up in arms. If they share their feelings with you, you can respond, “Well, that’s what we’ve decided to do, and luckily, we’re the only ones whose feelings matter.” It’s also worth letting people know that you are paying attention to their reactions and will be taking them into consideration when deciding who to include when the time comes for updates about the pregnancy and baby.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="124" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmalcizwl001o3b76gieyq8tp@published"&gt;Our daughter-in-law, “Alyssa,” has been a widow for four years. I adore her; she and our son, “Brian,” were so in love. But I don’t know how to bring up an awkward topic: dating again. Brian was diagnosed with aggressive leukemia at 27 and never got to turn 28. They’d always wanted kids, especially Allie. Sadly, Allie had a late miscarriage after his diagnosis. It was a horrible time for everyone, but Allie was consumed by the combined grief. We invited her to stay with us after his death because we loved her, and I was frankly worried about her well-being. She was working and seeing friends, but it was like she was sleepwalking through it all, and her physical health was visibly bad.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="132" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmalh2fpk00293b76juhwhmci@published"&gt;Alyssa slowly recovered and took the initiative to move into her own place two years ago. She seems well, and we still see her often, but she doesn’t seem to be dating, even casually. Last year, I gently suggested getting out there, and she sharply told me it was way too soon. But if she wants a baby, the time window to meet someone isn’t that long. I want her to have the family she talks about, and I know her own dad is pushing the “too soon” narrative at her. Her parents were worse than useless in her early widowhood: They got a divorce a few weeks before Brian’s death and then tried to get family to pick sides after his funeral. How can I gently suggest she consider dating anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="67" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmalcizwn001r3b76em2321sl@published"&gt;I can tell how much you care about Alyssa and sincerely want the best for her. I think it’s great that you’ve continued to nurture your relationship and want her to find love, even though I imagine seeing her with a new partner might bring up some complicated feelings about Brian. She’s lucky to have you in her life, cheering for her to rebuild and find happiness.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="61" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmalcizwn001s3b76uyjasc2k@published"&gt;But you need to take a big step back. When it comes to shaping Alyssa’s future, your role is to be a loving mother-in-law who can connect with her about a major source of grief. That’s it. You shouldn’t be a matchmaker or a fertility awareness counselor. And you definitely, definitely want to avoid becoming a source of stress and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="107" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmalcizwo001t3b76jnh0s5n7@published"&gt;Also, believe me, there is no way this woman is unaware of the typical age range in which people have biological children. She has friends and internet access. She knows. She may very well miss the window for that specific kind of motherhood, because she’s just not ready to get back out there and find a partner in time. If that happens, it won’t be a tragedy. In fact, it will actually be much better than forcing herself to date while she’s still in mourning, having a child, and then experiencing yet another devastating loss when the relationship doesn’t work out because she wasn’t over your son.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="57" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmalk6gfe003h3b76gkt5t1wm@published"&gt;I have been divorced for three years, and I have a 10-year-old and 7-year-old. My ex and I share equal custody, and I never thought she would play games like this using our kids. I have only been dating casually until I met “Emily.” We are talking about marriage, and after I informed my ex, she changed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="223" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmalk6gfe003i3b76klrpj50h@published"&gt;Now she can’t bear not hearing from our kids every single night I have them. She has to video chat with them for up to an hour every night and uses guilt tactics against our kids. I essentially feel like she has invaded my home, especially with Emily over. We have no privacy, and my ex tells the kids to show her the house when she calls. It is the same one I have owned since the divorce. If I take away their devices and tell my kids they will see their mom in a few days, they get hysterical. My 7-year-old has more meltdowns than they did as a toddler. This has only started since I told my ex about Emily, so it is obvious that she feels threatened and needs to get her claws in. We already had a big issue with her trying to change the custody drop-off from my work to my home, despite it being far away from her own (my work is equally distant from both houses). My ex denies everything, and I can’t afford to take her back to court. I love Emily and my kids. I am ready to start a new chapter in our lives. Emily and the kids got along great until now. I don’t want this issue to screw that up. Help!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="119" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmalk6gfh003l3b76rpjxa69a@published"&gt;This is tough because while you know your ex is using the nightly calls to insert herself into your new life, to put an end to them would upset and maybe even hurt your kids. You could end up—fairly or not—looking like the bad guy. In conflicts like this one, between divorced parents, I always think it’s important to keep your eye on the prize: your children’s well-being, and how you’ll look when they think back on the situation when they’re 30. The goal is for their therapists to one day say, “It sounds like your dad was a really safe person for you and put your needs first.” Sometimes, that means letting your ex win, at least temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="151" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmalk6gfi003m3b76wvnui0h0@published"&gt;But I also understand how unsettled you are by her thinly-veiled protest against the new relationship. So you should beat her at her own game. Everyone can gather around the iPad and call her together—yes, Emily too! You could start suggesting virtual game nights and remote dance parties. You might even volunteer to initiate the calls: “Hey, Em and the kids and I are making pancakes. Would you like me to FaceTime so you can see the process?” Your kids will get the contact they want with their mom and the very important feeling that the adults in their lives are kind to each other. You’ll totally avoid being the villain. You’ll take the mystery out of Emily’s presence. And eventually, I guarantee, your ex will get bored or see that she’s not getting under your skin the way she hoped she would, and her FaceTime fixation will slowly fade &lt;span class="slate-paragraph--tombstone"&gt;out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Nearly 19 million children in the United States have at least one parent with a substance use disorder, according to a new study published Monday in &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2833575" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;JAMA Pediatrics&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And a significant number of those children have a parent whose addiction is moderate or severe as opposed to mild, the study finds.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The number amounts to 1 in 4 children with a parent who has addiction.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I'm an addiction doc, and so I think about this issue all the time," says &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/doctors/22683/scott-hadland" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Scott Hadland&lt;/a&gt;, chief of adolescent medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, who wasn't involved in the new study. "Even still, I was surprised at how high that percentage was. It's just an enormous number of kids that are affected."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"If one-quarter of kids in the U.S. have a parent with a substance use disorder, that tells us that every day in our clinics we are encountering many, if not dozens of families that are affected by substance use disorders," he adds. "And we need to be poised and ready to help support those families."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The new study used data from the &lt;a href="https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/reports/rpt47095/National%20Report/National%20Report/2023-nsduh-annual-national.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health&lt;/a&gt;, a federal survey that estimated the prevalence of substance use and mental health disorders based on the most updated criteria in the &lt;em&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V&lt;/em&gt; (DSM-5). The national survey is managed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, but the team in charge of the survey &lt;a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2474698-us-government-fired-researchers-running-a-crucial-drug-use-survey/" target="_blank"&gt;was let go&lt;/a&gt; as part of the recent reduction in force. It is unclear how the cuts will affect the future of the survey.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The study's main finding is significantly higher than previous estimates (&lt;a href="https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/faa1b19e66053008e89782914f0aa693/children-at-risk-of-sud.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;7 million in a 2022 study&lt;/a&gt;), which had relied on diagnostic criteria from the DSM-4.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;The new study also estimated how many children have a parent with a moderate or severe addiction as opposed to mild.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We also found that 7.6 million children live in a household with a parent that has either a moderate or severe substance use disorder," says study author &lt;a href="https://nursing.umich.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/sean-esteban-mccabe" target="_blank"&gt;Sean Esteban McCabe&lt;/a&gt;, director of the Center for the Study of Drugs, Alcohol, Smoking and Health at the University of Michigan. "And 3.4 million live with a parent with multiple substance use disorders."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;McCabe and his team also found that more than 6 million children have a parent with a mental health condition in addition to a substance use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"These estimates are incredibly important to understand the scope of parental substance use disorder in the United States," wrote &lt;a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/children/doctors/20360/davida-schiff" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Davida Schiff&lt;/a&gt; in an email. Schiff is a pediatrician and addiction medicine physician at Massachusetts General Hospital and wasn't involved in the new study.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Another notable finding in the study, according to Schiff, is that a majority of the parents — 12 million — had alcohol use disorder. "While alcohol is more socially acceptable in our society, the study points to a need to pay greater attention to a rising number of children exposed to parental alcohol use disorder."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's also important to remember that alcohol is actually the leading cause of substance-related deaths in the United States," notes Hadland. "It actually kills more people in the U.S. than do opioids every year, but it's a slower death rate. It's a chronic disease process that affects, you know, somebody's liver, somebody's risk of developing cancer."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And children of parents with addiction are themselves at a higher risk of various physical and mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Young children growing up in homes affected by parental SUD (substance use disorder) are at increased risk of experiencing impaired caregiving, disruption of parental abilities, unintentional ingestions, and witnessing parental overdose," wrote Schiff.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;They are also at a higher risk of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;developing certain &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/05/08/nx-s1-5389885/medicaid-payments-barely-keep-hospital-mental-health-units-afloat-federal-cuts-could-sink-them" target="_blank"&gt;mental health conditions&lt;/a&gt; and substance use problems in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"One thing that I'm doing as a pediatrician is when I'm caring for a young person who has a parent with a substance use disorder, is making sure that I'm doing a good job asking about and screening for mental health concerns like depression, anxiety, ADHD, all of which we know can be more common in kids of parents with addiction," says Hadland.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that pediatricians &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/138/2/e20161575/52464/Families-Affected-by-Parental-Substance-Use?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank"&gt;ask patients&lt;/a&gt; and/or parents about substance use in the family in order to educate them about the risks of substance use and connect families to treatment when needed.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We as pediatricians and family medicine doctors might think about screening parents for substance use and substance use disorders when they come into our clinics to help make sure that we can identify problems and get parents connected to treatment, because that's probably in the best interest of their child," says Hadland.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Pediatric clinics affiliated with Mass General Brigham in the Boston area use a developmental screening that &lt;a href="https://www.teamupforchildren.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SWYC-2-Month-English-Age-specific-2021.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;includes questions about parental substance use&lt;/a&gt;, wrote Schiff.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Parents with addiction love their children and want the best for them, she says, but may not access treatment because of stigma about seeking help for addiction and barriers to accessing care.&lt;/p&gt;   
   

   &lt;p&gt;For parents with substance use disorder, Schiff says, she and her colleagues "discuss safe storage of substances, identification of a safe and sober caregiver for children during periods of active use, and provide training in naloxone administration should an unintentional ingestion occur."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As for parents with addiction who have infants, she recommends avoiding breastfeeding after using substances and discusses safe sleep practices "to prevent unsafe sleep injuries and infant suffocation."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We know that over three-fourths of people with substance use disorders do not get treatment," says McCabe. "And kids who are in households with parents that don't get help are much less likely to get help themselves. So I just think it's important for us who serve and provide care to children to understand what these numbers mean and also how we can design programs to meet these kids where they're at."&lt;/p&gt;

Is that true?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;In &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.instagram.com/drvondawright/reel/DBECJY2RTaH/" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;an Instagram post&lt;/a&gt; to her 1.3 million followers, Dr. Vonda Wright, an orthopedic sports surgeon in Orlando, Fla., describes how she consumes at least 130 grams of protein per day. Among her regular meal rotations are egg whites, protein shakes, beef sticks and several large servings of meat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;On social media, Dr. Wright encourages middle-aged women to eat a lot of protein, often recommending that they consume up to one gram of protein per pound of “ideal” body weight, or the weight they aspire to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;That’s far more protein than &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/well/eat/protein-fact-check.html" title=""&gt;federal guidelines and most nutrition experts recommend&lt;/a&gt;. In an interview with The Times, Dr. Wright said that this amount can help keep women strong, and prevent issues like hip fractures as they age. Is she right?

They often gain weight, &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/11/well/move/belly-fat-women.html" title=""&gt;particularly in the midsection&lt;/a&gt;, for example; and that’s linked with certain health risks, such as for cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes, Dr. Burns said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;At the same time, women usually lose bone and muscle, increasing their risk for osteoporosis, fractures and frailty, Dr. Burns said. Consuming enough protein, especially when paired with strength training, may help stave off those changes, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

They’re sugar-free but come in summery dessert flavors like Sherbet Swirl. On social media, the drinks are brandished by members of an official &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/alaninuambassadors/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;collegiate ambassadors program&lt;/a&gt;, gymnasts and cheerleaders whose dewy complexions suggest they’ve never had a hangover or slept through their alarm after a late-night study session. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alani Nu, which was founded in 2018 by fitness influencer and coach Katy Hearn and acquired by competitor Celsius for $1.8 billion this spring, has styled itself as the nectar that fuels today’s effortlessly high-achieving, hummingbird-like young woman. (You can imagine Margot Robbie cracking open a can in the “Barbie” movie, just before her character experiences an existential breakdown.) Its success shows how the &lt;a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/industry/energy-drink-production/4205/#TopQuestionsAnswered" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;$22 billion energy drink&lt;/a&gt; industry, long dominated by labels like Monster and Red Bull that use extreme sports swagger to appeal to young men, is tapping into the aesthetics of health and wellness to reach new demographics and continue its exponential growth. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many of the newer breeds tout “better for you ingredients” and benefits, from biotin (“oh, that hair skin + nails,” promises the copy on &lt;a href="https://getgorgie.com/pages/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Gorgie&lt;/a&gt;) to lion’s mane mushrooms (“boosts memory, focus, and mental clarity,” declares the vaguely intellectual &lt;a href="https://odysseyelixir.com/pages/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Odyssey&lt;/a&gt;). One hedge fund &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2025/04/09/monster-stock-drop-short-seller-report-wellness-drinks-steph-curry-dwayne-rock-michelle-obama-plezi-celsius/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recently said it was betting against&lt;/a&gt; the $55 billion Monster empire, predicting it would be edged out by brands that appear more health-conscious.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem, health experts say, is the new wellness-themed marketing may be worsening consumer confusion over the risks of energy drinks. Many energy drinks contain supercharged doses of caffeine that are particularly risky for children, teenagers, people who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and people with underlying heart conditions. More surprising may be their &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8401129/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;potential dangers&lt;/a&gt; when working out, particularly since energy drinks are often promoted by fitness influencers and athletes. Researchers also worry the health risks may be compounded when combined with other common energy-drink ingredients like the amino acid taurine and guarana, a plant seed that contains caffeine.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing kids who show up with tachycardia,” or rapid heartbeat, said Mark Corkins, the division chief of pediatric gastroenterology at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. “Some of them have chest pain and you find out they drink three or four energy drinks a day.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not just adolescents, Corkins said, but preteens too. He tells parents and kids the same thing: Energy drinks are not benign, nor are they a substitute for sleep. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“People just don’t have any idea of what they’re getting,” said Victoria Vetter, a pediatric cardiologist at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia who co-authored a recent &lt;a href="https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(24)00327-5/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;commentary&lt;/a&gt; on energy drinks’ risks to young people. She recalls evaluating a 7-year-old patient for an abnormal heart rhythm and asking if he drank any caffeine. Sure enough, his parents had bought him YouTube influencer &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/07/13/prime-energy-drink-logan-paul-chuck-schumer/"&gt;Logan Paul’s Prime Energy&lt;/a&gt;, which contains 200 milligrams of caffeine, after he saw a video game influencer drinking it and asked for one. (The brand also has a caffeine-free drink, Prime Hydration, with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6ewCKA2TXk" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;similar packaging&lt;/a&gt;, albeit in a bottle rather than a can — which critics say creates more potential confusion.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The American Beverage Association, which represents 94% of the U.S. energy drink market, said in a statement that for more than a decade, its members “have gone beyond all federal requirements when it comes to responsible labeling and marketing practices by displaying total caffeine content from all sources on labels and adhering to a long-standing commitment to not market to children.” &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children under age 12 avoid caffeine entirely, and that adolescents between 12-18 have no more than 100 mg per day. But an estimated &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/school-nutrition/energy-drinks/?CDC_AAref_Val=https://www.cdc.gov/healthyschools/nutrition/energy.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;30%-50% of adolescents&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. still consume energy drinks, many of which &lt;a href="https://www.cspinet.org/caffeine-chart#energy_drink" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;contain&lt;/a&gt; between 160-300 mg of caffeine per can. Some &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/school-nutrition/energy-drinks/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;high schools&lt;/a&gt; even make them available in &lt;a href="https://www.kctv5.com/video/2025/04/24/goddard-parents-weigh-allowing-energy-drinks-schools/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;vending machines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://hhsbroadcaster.com/15658/op-ed/opinion-energy-drinks-should-be-removed-from-the-cafeteria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cafeterias&lt;/a&gt;. Making them all the more risky is that many “are marketed in a way that makes them appear not to be energy drinks — not to be highly caffeinated products that could potentially be dangerous,” said Frances Fleming-Milici, director of marketing initiatives at the UConn Rudd Center for Food Policy and Health. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research has linked energy drinks to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5714807/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cardiovascular issues&lt;/a&gt; like arrhythmias and, in rare but potentially fatal cases, &lt;a href="https://www.heartrhythmjournal.com/article/S1547-5271(24)00189-9/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sudden cardiac arrest&lt;/a&gt;, along with a wide range of health problems like seizures, stomach problems, poor sleep, and higher levels of stress and anxiety. That said, it can be difficult to tell whether energy drinks are a direct cause of such health problems or merely correlated with them. The most recent data from America’s Poison Centers shows an uptick in calls about exposure to energy drinks in children and teens up to age 19, with 2,609 calls in 2024.   &lt;/p&gt;



		
		



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-energy-drinks-the-24-7-beverage"&gt;Energy drinks, the 24/7 beverage&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The health risks of energy drinks were a &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2013/7/energy-drinks-exploring-concerns-about-marketing-to-youth" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;hot topic&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S. about a decade ago. Since then, the market has only grown. As of 2025, there were &lt;a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/number-of-businesses/energy-drink-production/4205/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;254 energy drink businesses&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S., compared to just 49 in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What we’ve learned over the years is that energy is a need state” for which there’s round-the-clock demand, said Michael Bellas, head of the research and consulting firm Beverage Marketing Corporation. Other than water, he said, energy is the No. 1 fuel that today’s anxious, hassled consumer relies upon: “You can do it 24/7.”  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Leaning into that broad appeal, energy drinks are increasingly blending into the broader functional beverage market alongside &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-25/healthy-sodas-like-poppi-olipop-are-drawing-pepsi-and-coca-cola-s-attention?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NTU4ODQ5NSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ2MTkzMjk1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVjlRSDVEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI4RENBNTA1MjBBM0I0QUExQUM3NEQ4M0JERDFFOTI4OSJ9.G_15-_PwoZxqBIllo3SC3LeiNTE0L1ALbaxPoxowvhg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;probiotic sodas&lt;/a&gt;, hydrating sports drinks, and adaptogenic elixirs containing ingredients like hemp or ashwagandha meant to help with mood and stress. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The $9 billion Celsius strategically &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/PS0vwsMCOiA?si=0Opv3dkpxoaTkSZJ&amp;amp;t=860" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;built its brand&lt;/a&gt; within the health and beauty category in grocery stores, “next to the Atkins and the protein bars,” as CEO John Fieldly said in a recent interview, and then became affiliated with the &lt;a href="https://www.fooddive.com/news/celsius-is-luring-consumers-that-dont-want-grandfathers-energy-drink-c/607026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;wellness movement&lt;/a&gt; during Covid. Now the third-most-popular energy drink in the U.S. after Monster and Red Bull, a 12-ounce can of Celsius contains 200 mg of caffeine per can — half of the maximum daily amount considered safe for adults. (Twelve ounces of coffee contains anywhere from 113 mg to 247 mg of caffeine, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;FDA&lt;/a&gt;.) Though it’s labeled as an energy drink, some find it &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C_n3ZTTuyqQ/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;ig_rid=b5c605a1-5c1d-4632-80e2-dd74e07901b9" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;easy&lt;/a&gt; to mentally miscategorize: It’s often shelved alongside sparkling and flavored waters in grocery stores, featuring a “Live Fit” motto and minimalist packaging with pictures of berries or passion fruit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;High school and college-age women are drawn to Celsius because it’s low-calorie, experts say, and &lt;a href="https://www.celsius.com/the-science/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;claims to help speed up metabolism&lt;/a&gt;. The Wall Street Journal &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/young-women-with-eating-disorders-are-overdoing-it-with-energy-drinks-e82981e3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; the drinks are popular among young women with eating disorders, who may be more susceptible to adverse effects from too much caffeine. Celsius also markets itself as a pre- or post-workout drink, holding &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHZQ06pTo6M/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;influencer events&lt;/a&gt; at the Pilates-inspired gym Solidcore — which also &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/solidcore-launches-new-membership-benefit-program-core-collective-302037177.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sells cans in studios&lt;/a&gt; at a discount to members. “That’s something that is really not recommended to do at any age, is to consume these products and exert yourself and exercise,” said Fleming-Milici. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The American College of Sports Medicine &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/acsm-csmr/Fulltext/2018/02000/Energy_Drinks___A_Contemporary_Issues_Paper.9.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; that energy drinks be avoided before, during, and after strenuous activities, noting that some deaths allegedly linked to energy drinks happened under those circumstances. In the past year, &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14530577/energy-drinks-death-heart-attack-superfit-gym-caffeine.html#" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Katie Donnell&lt;/a&gt;, a teacher who habitually drank three energy drinks a day as part of her workout routine, died after a heart attack at age 28. Eighteen-year-old mixed martial arts athlete &lt;a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/other/tragic-death-of-young-athlete-during-mma-training-raises-concerns-over-energy-drink-safety/ar-AA1plhQ6?apiversion=v2&amp;amp;noservercache=1&amp;amp;domshim=1&amp;amp;renderwebcomponents=1&amp;amp;wcseo=1&amp;amp;batchservertelemetry=1&amp;amp;noservertelemetry=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Zach Doran&lt;/a&gt;, who had a fatal heart attack, reportedly consumed energy drinks regularly. It’s not known whether or to what extent the energy drinks played a role in their deaths.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other energy drinks are leaning less into wellness and more into partnerships with brands and flavors associated with childhood innocence. &lt;a href="https://drinkghost.com/collections/energy" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://cellucor.com/collections/c4-energy-drinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;C4&lt;/a&gt; have energy drinks in varieties like Welch’s Grape, Sour Patch Kids, and Popsicle. If it sounds like those might appeal to young kids, there are several &lt;a href="https://truthinadvertising.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/12_12_22-Ghost-complaint-letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;regulatory complaints&lt;/a&gt; and a recently dismissed &lt;a href="https://blog.priceplow.com/wp-content/uploads/barrales-v-ghost-mondelez-2024-02-12-complaint.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;class-action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; that make exactly that argument.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In her research on energy drink consumption among teens and children, Teesside University public health nutrition professor Amelia Lake found that parents were using energy drinks as breakfast substitutes. “The word energy is really positive — it’s going to give you energy and improve concentration,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Back in 2018, Lake &lt;a href="https://fuse.ac.uk/research/impactonpublichealthpracticepolicy/energydrinksandyoungpeopleshealth.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;campaigned&lt;/a&gt; with celebrity chef Jamie Oliver to curb sales of the product to young people in the U.K., prompting a number of grocery store chains to voluntarily instate age requirements. Energy drinks “remain the fastest-growing sector within the soft drink market,” said Lake, who is also the deputy director of Fuse, an inter-university center for translational research in public health. “They are highly profitable, and their manufacturers will say they are not marketing to children or young people. But when they are associated with everything that is part of youth culture — music, extreme sport — they can’t help being part of youth culture.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-health-risks-of-energy-drinks"&gt;The health risks of energy drinks&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most serious risks of energy drinks involve their impact on the heart, said Vetter, the pediatric cardiologist. “They increase heart rate, do all of these abnormal things — it can increase the likelihood of having a coronary event, a blockage of the artery, or a perforation of the artery,” she said. “Anybody who is more susceptible to these things is going to be more significantly affected, but a lot of people don’t know they’re at risk” — particularly young people who haven’t lived long enough for an underlying heart condition to be identified. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Mayo Clinic study published last year found that &lt;a href="https://www.heartrhythmjournal.com/article/S1547-5271(24)00189-9/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;seven out of 144&lt;/a&gt; survivors of sudden cardiac arrest had consumed an energy drink within 12 hours of the event. Four of the survivors had heart rhythm disorders, while three had no clear underlying cause. That’s a small sample size, and the authors note that energy drinks may be just one of several factors contributing to the “perfect storm” of circumstances that led to the sudden cardiac arrest. But they found sufficient evidence to say that energy drinks could be triggering for people with underlying heart disorders, and urged the Food and Drug Administration to provide guidelines about energy drink consumption and risks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coffee, of course, also contains caffeine —  but it’s less trendy among young people, less concentrated, and less likely to be downed quickly as a pre- or post-workout beverage. And it’s not just the caffeine that’s a potential risk for people with underlying conditions. “The energy drinks have a lot of other substances in them,” Vetter explained, the effects of which are not fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond heart issues, health experts have also &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10535526/#sec5-nutrients-15-03922" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;sounded alarms about links&lt;/a&gt; between energy drinks and seizures, gastrointestinal problems, dental issues (varieties like Monster often contain as much sugar as soda), and worse mental health — potentially because of all that tossing and turning that over-caffeinated people tend to do instead of sleep. Studies have linked energy drink consumption among young people with &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32845046/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;higher levels&lt;/a&gt; of anxiety, depression, stress, and insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“What happens is, you feel good immediately and then there’s a big crash,” said Vetter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-energy-drink-bans-and-caffeine-labeling-proposals"&gt;Energy drink bans and caffeine labeling proposals&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Concerned about the potential harms for people whose bodies are still developing, countries in Europe are increasingly cracking down on sales of energy drinks to minors. Lithuania, Latvia, Turkey, the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-11-03/why-this-region-in-spain-thinks-energy-drinks-are-bad-for-teens" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Galicia region of Spain&lt;/a&gt;, and Sweden have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350623003189" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;age requirements&lt;/a&gt;, and more recently &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11960718/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Poland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/05-02-2025-sale-of-energy-drinks-to-minors-banned-in-kazakhstan-in-bold-public-health-move" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Kazakhstan&lt;/a&gt; have followed suit. The U.K. Labor party &lt;a href="https://labour.org.uk/change/build-an-nhs-fit-for-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;pledged&lt;/a&gt; last year to ban energy drinks for children under 16 if elected to power (they won, though no law has been announced yet), and &lt;a href="https://www.praguedaily.news/2024/11/14/czech-government-plans-to-ban-sale-of-energy-drinks-to-children-under-15/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Czech lawmakers&lt;/a&gt; are moving forward with a similar ban.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the U.S., the &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/2511/text" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Sarah Katz Caffeine Safety Act&lt;/a&gt;, a House bill introduced by Rep. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) in March, would introduce some restrictions. Named after Katz, a 21-year-old college student who died from cardiac arrest in 2023 after drinking Panera Bread’s Charged Lemonade, the bill would introduce new requirements, such as a “high caffeine” notice on restaurant menus for beverages with more than 150 mg, and require government agencies to further study the safety of caffeine and other ingredients in energy drinks, as well as energy drinks’ marketing tactics. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the Make America Healthy Again movement calling attention to the health impacts of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/09/snap-soda-ban-maha-movement-health-nutrition-runs-into-political-headwinds/"&gt;sugary drinks like soda&lt;/a&gt; and the concern that many people feel over the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/22/food-companies-agree-to-phase-out-synthetic-dyes-handing-maha-a-victory/"&gt;safety of food ingredients&lt;/a&gt;, Menendez is &lt;a href="https://jcitytimes.com/rep-menendez-pushes-for-caffeine-labeling-law-after-death-of-jersey-city-college-student/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;hopeful&lt;/a&gt; about the bill’s chances. But for now, the U.S. has comparatively few regulations in place: Previous &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/07/13/prime-energy-drink-logan-paul-chuck-schumer/"&gt;attempts&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-xpm-2013-aug-31-la-na-energy-drinks-20130901-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Congress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/us/lobbyists-bearing-gifts-pursue-attorneys-general.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;state officials&lt;/a&gt; yielded only a &lt;a href="https://www.energydrinkinformation.com/responsible-labeling-and-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;voluntary commitment&lt;/a&gt; from manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only is there no minimum age for purchases of energy drinks in the U.S., some are &lt;a href="https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(24)00327-5/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;regulated by the FDA&lt;/a&gt; as dietary supplements rather than as soft drinks — meaning they can bypass the &lt;a href="https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(24)00327-5/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;FDA’s limit&lt;/a&gt; of 71 mg of caffeine per 12 ounces of carbonated soda. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Figuring out exactly how much caffeine an energy drink contains requires some detective work, and often a pair of reading glasses. Companies can place information about a drink’s amount of caffeine anywhere on the packaging — often in tiny type and consistently without context about the recommended daily limit. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alina Yang, a high school junior in New York’s Westchester County, said drinks like Celsius and Red Bull are a common accessory among her classmates. But her family has a history of heart disease, and as the founder of Guardians of the Heart, a nonprofit focused on educating young people about cardiovascular disease prevention, she tries to let her peers know that energy drinks can be a problem. The trouble is, she said, “adolescents don’t do anything until something bad happens to them.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a March 2025 &lt;a href="https://www.jpeds.com/article/S0022-3476(25)00091-5/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;letter to the editor&lt;/a&gt; for The Journal of Pediatrics, Yang described how influencers on TikTok and elsewhere can make energy drinks seem like not just a habit but a symbol of achievement. The medical students she watches for career inspiration on social media often guzzle the beverages while preparing for exams. The videos, which are sometimes sponsored by energy drink brands, are bound to make people like her wonder: “&lt;em&gt;Oh, if that’s the path I want to go, are those the habits I have to have and the decisions I’d have to make&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s the kind of logic that health experts worry could turn young people into lifelong energy drink customers. &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;Once we start dietary behaviors,” Lake said, “it’s really hard to change.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;STAT’s coverage of chronic health issues is supported by a grant from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg Philanthropies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/supporters/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;financial supporters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; are not involved in any decisions about our journalism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;My doctors cycled through treatments: first antibiotics, then decongestants, and finally allergy medications. Either I caught the most persistent cold imaginable or, somewhere along the way, spring allergies took over.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“There’s a real synergy between colds and allergies, especially if someone gets sick during tree pollen season. The result is often a longer, more intense period of symptoms,” said Dr. Frederic Little, a pulmonologist and allergist at Boston Medical Center.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Whether it was just allergies or a combination, I felt miserable. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dry and windy days trigger the worst allergies, yet &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/05/07/metro/dave-epstein-new-england-weekend-forecast/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/05/07/metro/dave-epstein-new-england-weekend-forecast/"&gt;last week’s rainy weather&lt;/a&gt; and the recent &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/04/11/metro/boston-new-england-rainy-weather/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/04/11/metro/boston-new-england-rainy-weather/"&gt;wet weekends&lt;/a&gt;, though a nuisance for many, were a blessing for allergy sufferers by helping suppress the burgeoning pollen season. You might be wondering, then, if this season is relatively tame, why am I and others still suffering?

Then, as high pressure and sinking air move in, those pollen particles find their way back down to the surface. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;According to meteorologist Shel Winkley, the growing season has increased significantly across the Carolinas, which in turn kicks off pollen season even earlier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Raleigh’s growing season has increased by 38 days. Charlotte, Asheville, Greenville, all are seeing a month or more of extra plant growth time per year,” said Winkley. A longer season in the Carolinas translates into an earlier season here in New England.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Some experts believe there is another piece to the equation that’s worsening your symptoms: &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00484-018-1558-7" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00484-018-1558-7"&gt;carbon dioxide&lt;/a&gt;. Research has shown that an increase in human-caused CO2 emissions is cranking out tree pollen grains &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00484-018-1558-7" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00484-018-1558-7"&gt;in greater numbers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“(Carbon dioxide) is plant food. It doesn’t just warm the planet — it supercharges plants to grow more and produce more pollen, making allergy seasons not only longer but more intense,” Winkley said. Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have now surpassed 425 parts per million, which is the highest concentration in human history and a clear marker of accelerating climate change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="flex align_items_base justify_space_between heading-container"&gt;&lt;h2 id="new_england's_triggering_pollens" class="heading | font_secondary gutter_20_0--mobile margin_bottom

Tree pollens are quite potent and tend to cause significant symptoms.

As he did his rounds with patients at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., his cellphone was bombarded with neighbors and friends seeking his expert advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;What kind of air purifier?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;Is an N-95 mask enough?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;&lt;em class="css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0"&gt;My daughter has asthma — should we rent a place farther away?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“Forty phone calls a day with the same set of questions,” Dr. Elsayegh recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;So when the chief administrative officer of the hospital invited him into his office to ask Dr. Elsayegh how he could support him and his family, Dr. Elsayegh replied instead, “Let’s open a clinic.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Just three weeks after the blaze tore through neighborhoods of Los Angeles, the hospital’s urban fire clinic for pulmonary issues began seeing patients. They came in droves, each with a different set of symptoms and concerns. The clinic has served as an early indicator of the types of health problems developing among those exposed to the fires, ranging from newfound shortness of breath in healthy people to exacerbated symptoms in patients with asthma, C.O.P.D. and other lung diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The health effects of an urban fire differ from a those of a wildfire, and when an entire community burns quickly, releasing unquantifiable toxins in unexpected directions for an unknowable period of time, there are long-term health effects that no expert can yet fully calculate. Dr. Elsayegh is making it his mission to support patients from the Palisades and surrounding communities for months and years into the future, when, he fears, cleanup crew members and others with chronic exposure may begin to show signs of severe lung diseases, like asbestosis and silicosis, and even cancers like mesothelioma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-kbghgg"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

In the body, these nutrients from foods go on to aid cells, organs and body systems, carrying out chemical and physical functions essential for health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers and scientists have studied the effect of certain foods on our brains and a “reduced risk of &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/alzheimers-disease" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; and a slower rate of cognitive decline” has been noted when certain diets are followed. However, other foods commonly eaten were “associated with a higher risk of developing dementia and worse cognition”.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s Research UK reports that “almost half (45%) of &lt;a data-content-type="section-topic" data-link-tracking="InArticle|Link" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/all-about/dementia" rel="Follow" target="_self"&gt;dementia&lt;/a&gt; cases worldwide could be prevented or delayed”. The charity linked such cases to “factors that affect our health throughout our life” with diet playing an important part along with other lifestyle choices and environmental factors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Red meat, processed meats and saturated fat can increase the risk of dementia, heart disease and diabetes, reports Alzheimer’s Research UK. The organisation explained that “foods like sausages and other processed meats, butter, cheese and cakes can be high in saturated fat” which can lead to many health issues - and these other diseases can up your risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; A &lt;a href="https://www.alzheimersresearchuk.org/dementia-information/reducing-your-risk/" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;report from Alzheimer’s Research UK&lt;/a&gt; stated: “What’s good for your heart is good for your brain. That’s because the brain relies on a good blood supply to stay healthy. Taking steps to look after our heart can help lower our risk of cardiovascular diseases, and our risk of dementia too.” &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s Research UK added that “eating too much saturated fat and sugar” can also “increase the risk” of dementia. The charity advises eating a healthy balanced diet, keeping your BMI at a healthy level and keeping as active as possible day-to-day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The National Institute on Aging (NIA) also reported on foods and brain health, explaining that it’s possible that “eating a certain diet affects biological mechanisms, such as oxidative stress and inflammation, that underlie Alzheimer’s”. NIA explained the possible link between a person’s diet indirectly “affecting other Alzheimer’s risk factors, such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;NIA reports &lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia/what-do-we-know-about-diet-and-prevention-alzheimers-disease" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;on the topic&lt;/a&gt;: “For example, the typical Western diet increases cardiovascular disease risk, possibly contributing to faster brain aging. A growing area of research focuses on the relationship between gut microbes - tiny organisms in the digestive system - and aging-related processes that lead to Alzheimer’s.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The important role of physical activity and exercise, and how this interacts with diet, cardiovascular health, and brain health must also be considered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-and-dementia/what-do-we-know-about-diet-and-prevention-alzheimers-disease" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;NIA added&lt;/a&gt;: “Many foods - blueberries, leafy greens, and curcumin (found in the spice turmeric), to name a few - have been studied for their potential cognitive benefit. These foods have been thought to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, or other properties that might help protect the brain. However, so far, there is no evidence that eating or avoiding a specific food can prevent Alzheimer’s or age-related cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Still, scientists continue to look for clues. A recent study showed that a molecule in green tea breaks apart tangles of the protein tau, which builds up in the brain due to Alzheimer’s. Based on this finding, the team identified other potential Alzheimer’s drug candidates. Another study, based on older adults’ reports of their eating habits, found that eating a daily serving of leafy green vegetables such as spinach or kale was associated with slower age-related cognitive decline, perhaps due to the neuroprotective effects of certain nutrients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Research has also shown that a diet that includes regular fish consumption is associated with higher cognitive function and slower cognitive decline with age.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s Research UK also pointed out several other factors that could help lower your risk of dementia such as looking after your hearing and sight, drinking less alcohol, being physically active and quitting smoking.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other environmental factors including air pollution, quality of early years education, social deprivation and social isolation could all lead to a higher risk of the disease, Alzheimer’s Research UK reports.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The charity added: "We have more control over some of these factors than others. For example, we often can’t change how much air pollution we are exposed to. But we can do more physical activity and watch what we eat.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxPRUxFUVk0NHVmXzZTR0xZRXFfemNOUXBxdUhCbG5WbUZUTEVOZjQ3QlhvbUNteEh1aEVGRTg2VnBveVlpQXNzdjJlTVVQZ3p5QTNsN0tVRVlWN3c1VDBaR2x1MHVNRXNtU0pZN2x3Ti1qbU1jck1fdG1yVi1Nd3RkWnpB0gGHAUFVX3lxTE1BVE1rdlgxUVh0bVIteTlGLTM3RDBIR1RxenJGd3VVYjRCYk9fVnNVc09UaDRIWDNCcGFwRU4yV01nTGtiZFZoaGZuMDE5ZjNodWVrZUpPa1U5MkZNU3F1VU1pR0p6cmpfMVFadnI2cVctMF80b01EWm85T25VYk9BWTctOWlEUQ</guid></item><item><title>防晒霜焦虑的增加：我们是否过度使用防晒霜？ - Refinery29 | The Rise Of Sunscreen Anxiety: Are We Taking SPF Too Far? - Refinery29</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE5LYmo3LS1Lcm9MWW1yZjE3R0Z0d2ltVDdqZzIyVlBXVmxGal94bjN0QWpZUnJtQ2xoQjI3bks4NWdCcXEtMWZoWTZZSjJHNmg4UXFPVDhiSUlzTlN0LWtiVl9hbUFsMThMb29odjNjMV83dWNCdUtTQnFwZnlPU28?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="section-text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you go to the beach, you should reapply sun protection every two hours,” adds Dr Phillips, and if you’re entering the water, it may get washed off, so you need to apply it again once you’re out.” The rules are the same regardless of your &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/vitamin-d-myth-sunscreen-dark-skin"&gt;skin tone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, says Dr Phillips. But what about when it isn’t as sunny? Suppose you’re heading to work at 8 a.m. when it's relatively dark outside, and coming home in the evening well after the sun has set. Is sunscreen necessary then? “When the UV index is low in early mornings, you don’t need to use [sunscreen] as much,” Dr Phillips explains, especially if you’re wearing more clothes. Dr Phillips recommends focusing on exposed areas, applying a teaspoon-sized amount of SPF to your face and neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Refinery29</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 06:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE5LYmo3LS1Lcm9MWW1yZjE3R0Z0d2ltVDdqZzIyVlBXVmxGal94bjN0QWpZUnJtQ2xoQjI3bks4NWdCcXEtMWZoWTZZSjJHNmg4UXFPVDhiSUlzTlN0LWtiVl9hbUFsMThMb29odjNjMV83dWNCdUtTQnFwZnlPU28</guid></item><item><title>我正在用11美元的咖啡因眼霜治疗我的黑眼圈，让粉丝看起来清醒- instyle.com | I’m Treating My Dark Circles With an $11 Caffeine Eye Cream That Makes Fans Look Awake - instyle.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE5mWVRtMnFyNEhpQktBckN0MGhLZVg1WFhpNGZ4aDBRWkQwR01vdzdUSzdMbFVnemExa2l6QUtUM1hXOEk2alJYZmZnY0lvWG1ONS1uRkl3ZGk3QURXbTZxM2hhc3J4azU2UVdDamk2Vmp6Y2ppMTZjUA?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As someone &lt;a href="https://www.instyle.com/how-to-shade-match-foundation-5383450" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;with fair skin&lt;/a&gt; and night-owl habits, I can always count on my dark circles to make an appearance.

So, when she was diagnosed with stage 4 colon &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-853857c0-2f40-11f0-a288-bfe0bf43e896"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, her world was turned upside down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the 36-year-old mother of two was determined to beat her diagnosis - which has a survival rate of 13 percent - and she 'hit the ground running' and started an aggressive chemotherapy regimen in May 2024. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But she's been been hit with painful side effects and medical bills that could exceed half a million dollars.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her husband, Corey Candrilli, a disabled US Army combat veteran said: 'I don’t understand exactly what she’s going through, but I understand pain. I understand the highs and lows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She's amazing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since her diagnosis, Mrs Candrilli has undergone 20 rounds of chemotherapy and multiple surgeries to try and remove tumors, but her fight isn't over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Candrilli said his wife's delayed diagnosis - she visited multiple doctors and had her symptoms dismissed - puts a spotlight on the need for a law that would require insurance companies to cover colonoscopies for younger patients with certain symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colonscopies are the gold standard for screening for the disease, which is on the rise in young people across the US. They are typically recommended to begin at 45 and occur every 10 years so long as results are normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, lack of - and confusion over - insurance coverage has led people to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14556451/reason-colon-cancer-cases-rising-colonoscopy-charges.html"&gt;delay screening or has burdened them with bills for thousands of dollars&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Heather Candrilli is a mom-of-two who was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer last May&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Candrilli has undergone 20 rounds of chemotherapy and multiple surgeries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On most insurance plans, the procedure should cost on average $79 out-of-pocket, with health insurers footing the rest of the about $2,125 bill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But recently, patients have come forward to say they've been charged upward of $5,000, $7,000 and even $20,000 for the procedure, despite having health insurance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The couple live in New York, where the law requires insurance coverage for colonoscopies only for people 45 and older. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You can’t get it. It’s unbelievable,’' Mr Candrilli &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.silive.com/news/2025/05/amazing-young-mother-battles-stage-4-colon-cancer-after-delayed-diagnosis.html"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; SI Live of colonoscopies before 45. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It’s truly unbelievable. These are your teachers, your parents, people raising your children. These are our future.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The army veteran said his wife had been experiencing bloating and abdominal pain but, 'when you're about that age, you're busy rising a family, and the last thing you're going to be thinking about is yourself.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Candrilli was tested for the chronic autoimmune diseases crohn's and celiac, but the couple said a colonoscopy was never suggested. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, an ultrasound of Mrs Candrilli's stomach detected something on her liver, then a colonoscopy was performed, which revealed an aggressively growing tumor that had spread to other parts of her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Candrilli said: 'As soon as they ordered the colonoscopy, they saw the tumor right there on her colon.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Cory Candrilli, an army veteran, said his wife had been experiencing bloating and abdominal pain but a colonoscopy was never suggested&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After undergoing 20 rounds of chemotherapy, Mrs Candrilli is awaiting a liver transplant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mrs Candrilli underwent surgery to remove a portion of her colon and is now awaiting a liver transplant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Since her initial surgery, she has undergone 20 rounds of chemotherapy, which her husband said are shrinking the tumors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These sessions required her to spend four hours in the hospital every two weeks to receive the medication and then wear an external device that continued delivering chemotherapy to her for 48 hours after. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;And while the treatments are working, Mr Candrilli said the family cannot keep up with medical bills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'It’s ridiculously expensive. Insurance is helpful, but we’ve been told that, even with insurance, this can go up to at least $500,000.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A GoFundMe account has been set up to help the family with medical bills as Mrs Candrilli stopped working as a nanny before becoming a mother and supporting her husband after he suffered a traumatic brain injury in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told SI Live: 'She's the greatest medicine I've ever had my whole life.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About 67 percent of adults adhere to current screening requirements, below the US government target of at least 70 percent.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colon cancer often causes no symptoms until it has spread to other areas of the body, where it becomes harder to treat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But warning signs can include trouble using the bathroom, blood in feces and persistent diarrhea or constipation.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The couple said the treatments are working, but they cannot keep up with medical bills&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Mrs Candrilli is mom to the Candrillis' two sons, Lucas, 2, and James, 5&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Doctors fear that, faced with the risk of high prices, patients may put off any screenings — which can find pre-cancerous growths and eliminate them, slashing the risk of developing the cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They may also put off screenings even when they have symptoms, risking the cancer reaching an advanced stage — making it harder to treat and deadlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Glenn Littenberg, a physician who recently chaired the reimbursement committee of the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, told DailyMail.com: 'The majority of people who do preventative screening should have very little out-of-pocket cost, regardless of where they go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But there are horror stories, with the exception being when someone goes out of network for their physical or hospital.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If patients are putting off colonoscopies worrying about costs, then this means these aren't removed.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added: 'Screening reveals benign polyps that aren't cancer, but by removing them we are reducing the risk of cancer developing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you put off screening and don't do anything, there's certainly a much higher probability that when you go in, you have symptoms,' which may raise the risk of being diagnosed with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 04:03:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>根据科学家的说法，每天吃这种水果可以将痴呆风险降低28 ％ -美国镜报 | Eating this fruit daily could slash dementia risk by 28%, according to scientists - The Mirror US</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxQZU52WUJyOXR5ZDhyWWNqQldNQ2pIbVN1UUFtWDVCcWdLWTVyUEg1bVRDMDE4aGZMNTdyUUhnSTdUb19MMkY2ZmRSdmN1UDc2S0lMdUxGOE51emRTSGV6OTAyamtWQzU0aTNxR0poWmRHVE9FdUVMZkcyY2JMR1QxSDV30gGHAUFVX3lxTE13Uld6amtWeHRDbFBMTzlJQ19qSWpFVEw5REFTLVpRY2pSM2tjMk5ZUm56OGxpSTkzZkFjTV9iV2NFajBfREJCWEZtenY4a0s0LVVzdnNEX0cyTUtXcy1zeWlZU0RmcDlDWmNrTGdncXRweFlOZ0tPbjZGcFRQVVRMZlAtUjY4bw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article id="article-body" class="ArticleBody_article__AwrJE" data-testid="body"&gt;&lt;h1 class="HeadingOne_heading-one__mmNWJ  __className_e8a338"&gt;Eating this fruit daily could slash dementia risk by 28%, according to scientists&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2 class="LeadText_lead-text__wd_PA __className_5a991a" data-testid="leadtext"&gt;Adding this fruit to your diet could help lower your chances of cognitive decline later in life.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="ImageEmbed_image-embed__0T8WX ImageEmbed_image-lead__Ti3qQ" data-testid="leadimage"&gt;&lt;figure class="Figure_figure__Uce4f"&gt;&lt;img src="https://i2-prod.themirror.com/article1145879.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1177514735.jpg" alt="Woman eating berries" loading="eager" srcset="https://i2-prod.themirror.com/article1145879.ece/ALTERNATES/s508/0_GettyImages-1177514735.jpg 508w, https://i2-prod.themirror.com/article1145879.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/0_GettyImages-1177514735.jpg 615w,

class="_s30J clearfix  "&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="0"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because if you’ve been sneezing like crazy, you’re definitely not alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, you’ve been sniffling, sneezing, rubbing your itchy eyes and wondering: What is going on this year?! Well, here’s the not-so-great news—seasonal allergies are brutal in 2025.And if you’re living in certain parts of the U.S., it’s like walking into a pollen storm every time you step outside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is this happening? Two words: climate change. Warmer temperatures and more CO₂ mean longer growing seasons, which means more pollen. Add to that a bit of pollution and urbanization, and you’ve got yourself the perfect sneeze-fest. Pollen becomes stickier, stays in the air longer, and triggers stronger reactions than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curious which cities are leading the pack in allergy misery this year? The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) dropped its annual list, and well… let’s just say, some cities are definitely not doing your sinuses any favors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Top 10 worst US cities for pollen in 2025&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;1. Wichita, Kansas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wichita takes the top spot for the third year in a row. The combo of open plains, heavy pollen winds, and not-so-great access to allergists makes this city an allergy sufferer’s nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;2. New Orleans, Louisiana&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jumped a whopping 30 spots since last year. Why? That warm, sticky, humid weather means pollen basically never takes a day off. Plus, recent hurricanes added even more moisture—pollen’s BFF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;3. Oklahoma City, Oklahoma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="24"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tree and grass pollen are off the charts. Add in one of the highest over-the-counter allergy med usage rates in the country, and it’s clear: people here are struggling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="26"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;4. Tulsa, Oklahoma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same deal as Oklahoma. High pollen counts, lots of meds being used, and a big ol’ bowl of allergy soup in the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;5. Memphis, Tennessee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grass and weed pollen are worse than average here, and people are loading up on allergy meds left and right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;6. Little Rock, Arkansas&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Triple threat: tree, grass, and weed pollen. Even with decent access to allergy specialists, it’s a rough ride for sensitive noses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;7. Raleigh, North Carolina&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raleigh’s got all three pollen types in full swing—and fewer allergy doctors per capita, which doesn’t help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;8. Richmond, Virginia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;High pollen levels across the board, though slightly better access to specialists means folks have some support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;9. Greenville, South Carolina&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grass and weed pollen are the main culprits here. Med use is high, so clearly people are feeling it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;10. Greensboro, North Carolina&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tree, grass, and weed pollen are worse than average here too, making outdoor activities feel like punishment for anyone with allergies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What can you actually do about it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you live in one of these cities (or even nearby), don’t panic. You’re not doomed to a life of tissues and antihistamine fog. Here’s how to fight back against the pollen army:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="61"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start your meds early: Don’t wait until you’re already a sniffly mess. Get a jump start with antihistamines before peak season hits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep your windows shut: Yes, even if the weather’s perfect. Run the AC instead—it filters the air and keeps pollen out of your house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shower when you come in: Pollen loves to cling to skin and hair. Give yourself a rinse after being outside, especially during high-pollen hours (usually morning and early evening).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check the pollen forecast: Sites like Pollen.com or even your weather app give you daily pollen updates. Plan your outdoor time when counts are low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk to an allergist: Seriously, don’t suffer in silence. A specialist can set you up with a treatment plan, which may include allergy testing or even long-term solutions like immunotherapy (a.k.a. allergy shots).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;The content in this article is intended for informational and educational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

			&lt;p&gt;Ever felt like a song really resonates with you? That may be more true than you think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new theory suggests that we don't just listen to it; our bodies physically resonate with music, as our brains' natural oscillations synchronize with structures like rhythm and pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Music is often thought of as a '&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/music-could-be-a-universal-language-we-all-understand"&gt;universal language&lt;/a&gt;' – people across cultures will bust out similar moves, and young kids will instinctively bop to a beat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to neural resonance theory, it's not just that we learn to expect and predict what's coming; aspects like harmony in the music we make and enjoy sound&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/music-sends-a-pleasurable-chill-through-the-brain-and-scientists-can-see-it"&gt; so good to us&lt;/a&gt; because they're in sync with the brain's resonant patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This theory suggests that music is powerful not just because we hear it, but because our brains and bodies become it," &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/channels/news/study-suggests-we-dont-just-hear-music-become-it-365203"&gt;says Caroline Palmer&lt;/a&gt;, neuroscientist at McGill University in Canada. "That has big implications for therapy, education, and technology."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not a coincidence, of course. As humans messed around with music over millennia, we figured out what sounds best without necessarily understanding why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neural resonance theory (NRT) has now been formally described by Palmer and co-authors in a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41583-025-00915-4"&gt;perspective paper&lt;/a&gt; reviewing the literature on musical neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_160576" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-160576" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/music-brain-2-642x370.jpg" alt="Music Literally Resonates With Our Brain Rhythms, New Theory Says" class="wp-image-160576 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/music-brain-2-642x370.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/music-brain-2-720x415.jpg 720w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/music-brain-2-768x443.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/music-brain-2-1536x886.jpg 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/music-brain-2-600x346.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/05/music-brain-2.jpg 1809w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-160576" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Human brain oscillations synchronize with musical structures. (BlackJack3D/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the key suggestions of NRT is that neural oscillations synchronize with external audio at different rates. On the slower end of the timescale is what we call rhythm, with distinct beats you can dance or bang a drum to. Neurons in the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"&gt;cortex&lt;/a&gt; oscillate at frequencies that resonate with those pulses in the music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher frequencies, from about 30 to over 4,000 Hertz, are perceived as pitch. Gamma-frequency oscillations in the cortex sync up with the lower end of that, while the auditory nerve, brain stem, and cochlea resonate at the higher pitches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all comes together to make music pleasurable regardless of musical background – from young children to classically trained pros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Statistically universal structures may have arisen in music because they correspond to stable states of complex, pattern-forming dynamical systems," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41583-025-00915-4"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not to say that there's no learned factor to appreciating music; the team says that aspects like pulse and more complex structures like meter can vary widely based on culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple pulses, like one you might clap to or bounce a baby on your knee to, develop more quickly and become stronger over time, but more complex structures are culture-specific. Over time, the brain oscillations showed bias towards those learned structures, called attunement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other aspects covered by NRT include groove, which is basically the urge to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/music-humans-cant-even-hear-makes-us-dance-more-experiment-shows"&gt;move your body to music&lt;/a&gt;. When a beat doesn't follow a predictable pulse but falls between pulses to a degree, the brain has to fill in the blanks – which the team calls nonlinear resonance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"High groove ratings" required just the right amount of this nonlinear resonance. Of course, music that's too disjointed isn't groovy enough to dance to either. Understandably, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hit-songs-do-something-to-your-brain-and-it-could-be-the-future-of-music"&gt;pop music&lt;/a&gt; tends to fall right in the middle of that range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper also explores how NRT explains various other aspects of music, and what we can learn by applying it to this &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-adorable-sea-lion-can-keep-a-beat-better-than-some-humans"&gt;universal joy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"NRT can provide insights into both neuroscience and human behavior, as well as the link between the two," the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41583-025-00915-4"&gt;researchers write&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Such insights can shed light on the interconnectedness of brain and body, the ability of music to communicate affect and emotion, the role of music in interpersonal bonding, and applications of music to brain health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perspective was published in the journal &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41583-025-00915-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Reviews Neuroscience&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Is it OK to mix and match meals if there’s one I don’t like?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes! This meal plan is meant to serve as inspiration. It doesn’t need to be followed exactly to reap the benefits. When choosing recipes, we made sure to check the calories, fiber, protein and sodium to align with the parameters of this plan and be within our sodium limits. If you’re making a recipe swap, it may be helpful to choose a recipe with similar calories, fiber, protein and sodium levels. For more inspiration, check out these delicious &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/18003/lifestyle-diets/vegan/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based recipes.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Can I eat the same breakfast or lunch every day?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_2-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, it’s fine to eat the same breakfast or lunch every day. The breakfasts range from 359 to 419 calories while the lunches span 354 to 496 calories. These ranges are fairly close, though if you’re closely monitoring your calories or other nutrients, like protein, you may want to adjust a snack or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item " data-ordinal="3"&gt;

&lt;/svg&gt;
&lt;span class="accordion__title"&gt;Why is there not a 1,200 calorie modification?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="accordion__body"&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_3-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We no longer provide modifications for 1,200-calorie days in our meal plans. The 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans suggests that limiting calories to 1,200 per day is too low for most people to meet their nutritional needs, plus it’s unsustainable for long-term health and well-being. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_190-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-health-benefits-of-plant-based-diets"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_191-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Health Benefits of Plant-Based Diets &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_192-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plant-based diets are linked with a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291622/the-health-benefits-of-eating-a-plant-based-diet-and-how-to-get-started/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;number of health benefits&lt;/a&gt;. They’re particularly beneficial for heart health since they tend to be low in saturated fat and high in fiber. Plant-based diets can also help lower your risk of type 2 diabetes and certain kinds of cancers.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The fiber, antioxidants and other nutrients in plant foods help promote a healthy gut microbiome, which improves insulin sensitivity, reduces inflammation and supports gut health.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;You don’t have to cut out animal products entirely to reap these benefits. For example, the Mediterranean diet includes small amounts of dairy, eggs, fish and poultry, and it’s linked with loads of health benefits.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Still, prioritizing plant foods can make a difference when it comes to your health.

      &lt;p&gt;FARGO — More than 800 students in Fargo, Moorhead and West Fargo public schools do not meet vaccination requirements for measles, school officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those students will remain in class, at least for now, after reports that the highly contagious virus 
    
      &lt;a class="Link " href="https://www.inforum.com/news/north-dakota/first-cases-of-measles-are-reported-in-cass-county" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;has reached Cass County.&lt;/a&gt;
    
      &lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;The North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services reported Sunday, May 11, that two unvaccinated people in Cass County were infected during international travel. One person has been hospitalized, according to a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two cases included an adult and child between the ages of 5 and 19 years old, according to the state’s measles website. They are not related to nine other cases that were reported 
    
      &lt;a class="Link " href="https://www.inforum.com/news/north-dakota/north-dakota-reports-first-measles-case-amid-declining-vaccination-rates" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;this month in Williams County, home to Williston.&lt;/a&gt;
    
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Dakota law requires a school that has been exposed to a person with measles pull children from class for 21 days who do not have the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. That includes year-end celebrations, last day parties, field trips, graduation ceremonies and extracurricular activities, according to a letter to parents and guardians from West Fargo Public Schools.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;“West Fargo Public Schools is committed to keeping our stakeholders informed and prepared,” the letter said. “While there is no cause for alarm at this time, we want you to be aware of the steps we are legally required to follow should a case occur.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state hasn’t required any schools in Cass County to pull students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fargo Public Schools said it has 297 children, or 2.6% of its student body, who are not vaccinated for measles. West Fargo Public Schools reported 303 students, or 2.3%. Moorhead has 237 students who are not vaccinated, or 3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health officials 
    
      &lt;a class="Link " href="https://www.inforum.com/news/north-dakota/with-lower-measles-vaccine-rates-some-north-dakota-counties-may-struggle-with-virus-experts-say" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;recommend 95% of the population&lt;/a&gt;
    
       have the MMR vaccination to prevent widespread infection. North Dakota is at less than 90%, while Minnesota is at 86.5%. Cass County's vaccination rate is almost 93%. Clay is at 87%. &lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;North Dakota health officials have ordered Williston Public Schools to pull unvaccinated students from Missouri Elementary School, Williston Middle School and Williston High School until late May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williston Public Schools has 150 children, or 2.8% of its student population, that do not meet MMR requirements, Williston Schools Superintendent Jason Germundson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The students who have been pulled from schools are using virtual learning to stay involved, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germundson said his district doesn't plan to cancel any sporting events, proms or graduation. The Western Dakota Association, the high school athletic conference Williston competes in, is on board with letting Williston continue to send student athletes to competitions, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graduation will happen May 25, after the quarantine period for unvaccinated students is over, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re trying to carry on as business as usual,” he told The Forum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last day of school for Williston is May 23.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;“If we can get through the next 10 days without any incidents, then we’ll be good,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    
      &lt;p&gt;Moorhead Public Schools follows the Minnesota Department of Health’s guidance, district spokeswoman Brenda Richman said. It also “proactively and continuously reviews” its students’ vaccination status and hosts vaccine events, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This provides a convenient and accessible option for families,” Richman said. “MAPS (Minnesota Area Public Schools) health services department consistently provides family outreach and education on the importance of vaccinations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moorhead’s last day of school is May 30, with graduation planned for that evening, according to its school calendar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fargo Public Schools, West Fargo Public Schools and Moorhead Public Schools say there have been no measles exposures in their school facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fargo Public Schools spokeswoman AnnMarie Campbell said her district is working with Fargo Cass Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If a case of measles would be reported among our student body, we would take direction from FCPH and state health officials on any impacts to our schools,” Campbell said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;Fargo’s last day is June 5, with graduation on June 6 and 8. West Fargo’s last day is May 22 and graduation is on May 25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All graduation ceremonies, sports and year-end events are moving forward as planned, and we do not have any concerns at this time,” West Fargo Schools spokeswoman Heather Leas said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;Williston Schools has been preparing for measles for about a month before it arrived, said Lynn Douglas, nursing director for the district. Officials there used social media, local media outlets, emails and other messaging to keep parents informed about the highly contagious respiratory disease, what the school is required to do and how to prepare for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We like to keep our parents, guardians and employees aware of any possible thing that could happen,” she said. “Regularly throughout the year, we do send out information.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles has just arrived in Cass County, but state health officials say they have been preparing for months to prevent the spread of the virus that was once believed to be eradicated in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Fargo Cass Public Health has been gearing up for the anticipated arrival of measles since the first U.S. cases were reported this year, FCPH Director Jenn Faul said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was increasing outreach to the school systems to look at their vaccination rates and to encourage vaccinations,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
    
      
    
      &lt;p&gt;The agency also reached out to child care providers, FCPH immunization coordinator Cheryl Wavrin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fargo Cass Public Health will host a walk-in clinic for the MMR vaccination from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m. Thursday at its 1240 25th St. S. Fargo location, Wavrin said. People should bring insurance cards, but those who don’t have insurance can apply for the vaccines for children program, which provides federal assistance at no cost to eligible children. A similar program exists for adults, according to North Dakota Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We will not turn anyone away if you don’t have health insurance,” Wavrin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients also can make appointments with FCPH by calling 701-241-1383, Wavrin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency also has delivered the MMR vaccine to schools in Cass County so parents can inoculate their children there, Faul said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clay County Public Health offers state-supplied vaccinations for its residents, including those in Moorhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents in Minnesota and North Dakota can check their vaccination records with the Docket app, which can be found at

&lt;p&gt;The ruling, by US District Court Judge Brian Murphy, is the latest in &lt;a href="https://www.universalhub.com/2025/third-time-month-court-upholds-boston-medical"&gt;a string of defeats&lt;/a&gt; in federal court for Boston-area hospital employees who sued after they were fired for refusing Covid-19 shots in 2021 and 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Lavine, who had worked at the medical center - now called Salem Hospital -  since 2005, was fired in November, 2021, after the then Partners Healthcare rejected his request for a religious exemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his ruling today,  Murphy cited two key reasons to dismiss Lavine's demands for at least $2 million in recompense: He had gotten numerous other shots in the past and that the hospital had legitimate reasons to bar somebody who routinely came in contact with, as Murphy put it, "cardiac patients, elderly patients, cancer patients, individuals recovering from surgery, and patients with autoimmune disorders."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While acknowledging the hospital had granted Lavine exemptions for flu shots, Murphy wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plaintiff does not, however, dispute that the process for his flu vaccine exemption request differed from the Vaccination Policy that would be implemented for COVID-19 due to the volume of exemption requests from the Vaccination Policy that MGB received and because the severity of the threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic far exceeded that posed by the flu in prior years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintiff has also contended that "he could not take the COVID Vaccine and allow it to destroy Gods work"; that "being vaccinated would disrupt and undermine [his] relationship with God"; and that he has held his beliefs about vaccinations since 1995. Plaintiff has been vaccinated on 15 occasions between 1997 and 2019.  For example, Plaintiff received the MMR vaccine in 2002 and 2003, and he believes that he may have received that vaccine - even though doing so violated his religious beliefs - because it was required for nursing school.  More recently, in August 2021, Plaintiff began taking insulin by injection - also in asserted violation of his religious beliefs - in order to obtain an increase in his life insurance.  When Plaintiff was asked why he could violate his religious beliefs to obtain an increase in life insurance but could not do so when his employer required COVID-19 vaccination, Plaintiff testified that his faith "waxes and wanes."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Murphy also concluded that Mass General Brigham's right to do what it could to protect its patients and staff from a deadline pandemic outweighed Lavine's right to practice his religion, especially since Lavine wanted to continue working his normal job. That, Murphy concluded, would be an "undue hardship" on the hospital and so a reason to fire employees who refused the shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defendants contend that "the sole accommodation Plaintiff sought - to remain in his position as an inpatient hospital nurse while unvaccinated against COVID - would have required Defendants to place Plaintiff's patients, not to mention other patients, fellow hospital staff, visitors, and members of the public, at an unacceptable increased risk of danger from infection with a potentially fatal disease," thereby compelling a finding of undue hardship as a matter of law.  Based on the undisputed evidence, this Court agrees. ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is undisputed that Plaintiff worked at the Hospital in person, interacting directly with vulnerable patients, patients' family members, members of the public, and colleagues; and that it was not always possible for him to socially distance. It is also undisputed that COVID-19 had placed an immense burden on MGB as a healthcare system, even with all of MGB's other controls, such as masking requirements and other infection control measures, there was still spread of COVID-19 in hospitals, and there was a necessity for more measures to protect patients and staff, COVID-19 had been uniquely disruptive to hospital operations and workforce continuity, and the available COVID-19 vaccines afforded a level of additional and constant protection, MGB's decision to implement the Vaccination Policy was informed by its own experience as a healthcare system and the latest public health guidance from federal and state public health authorities, including the CDC, an important consideration for MGB's decision to implement the Vaccination Policy was public and patient trust in the safety of MGB facilities. Accordingly, granting the requested accommodation would have resulted in undue hardship.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lavine was represented by Richard Chambers of Lynnfield, who has &lt;a href="https://www.universalhub.com/2024/if-youre-going-refuse-covid-19-shots-religious"&gt;represented&lt;/a&gt; other Boston-area &lt;a href="https://www.universalhub.com/2023/requiring-covid-19-shots-isnt-assault-and-group"&gt;hospital workers&lt;/a&gt; who sued over the shots, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.universalhub.com/2023/judge-tosses-lawsuit-against-boston-rule-requiring"&gt;a group of Boston city employees, other local workers, visitors and restaurant owners&lt;/a&gt; who sued over the city's three-month requirement that people entering certain indoor public spaces show proof of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;

Pesticides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's happening? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Researchers from the Barrow Neurological Institute tracked Parkinson's diagnoses in Olmsted County, Minnesota, over a 24-year span, cross-referencing patient addresses with the locations of 139 nearby golf courses. The &lt;a href="https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/residential-proximity-golf-courses-linked-parkinsons-disease-2025a1000bau" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:analysis;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; revealed a clear pattern: the closer someone lived to a golf course, the higher their odds of developing Parkinson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And it's not just air exposure. Residents whose tap water came from groundwater sources near a golf course had nearly double the risk of developing the disease. Those living in "vulnerable groundwater regions" — where rainwater can carry chemicals through porous bedrock more easily — faced even greater odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"This isn't about golf," said Dr. Michael Okun, national medical adviser for the Parkinson's Foundation. "It's about pesticides, environmental exposures, and preventable risks hiding in plain sight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is this concerning? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Parkinson's disease is a serious progressive condition that impacts movement, speech, and cognitive function. There's no cure — and cases are on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As Newsweek &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/parkinsons-disease-linked-golf-courses-new-study-2070602" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:covered;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;covered&lt;/a&gt;, Dr. Okun recently posted to X, formerly Twitter, saying, "Parkinson's cases are exploding. We now face 11.8 million cases globally, and the numbers are climbing fast. Despite this reality, we still spend just 2 to 3 cents of every Parkinson's dollar on prevention. That has to change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While genetics do play a role, environmental factors like pesticide exposure are increasingly being linked to the disease. Chemicals such as paraquat and rotenone — often used to maintain lush greens — have been shown to trigger Parkinson-like symptoms in animal studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And the U.S. has pesticide risks up to 15 times higher on golf courses than &lt;a href="https://beyondpesticides.org/dailynewsblog/2023/03/pesticide-dangers-at-golf-courses-much-higher-in-the-us-than-europe-study-finds/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:European countries;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;European countries&lt;/a&gt; do, according to Beyond Pesticides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This research adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting our outdoor environments, especially in urban and suburban areas, may not be as safe as they seem — especially when aesthetics are prioritized over health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What's being done about it? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While the study doesn't explicitly call for people to move away from golf courses, experts say there's a clear need to reevaluate how pesticides are used in public spaces. Cities and states can take action by tightening regulations on chemical applications near residential areas and upgrading municipal water treatment in high-risk zones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;For those living near golf courses, consider reaching out to local environmental health agencies to learn about pesticide transparency laws and groundwater safety initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As Dr. Okun noted, "This is a warning we can't ignore.

        &lt;hr class="custom-gradient-background my-6 h-[6px] max-w-[75px] border-0"&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“Skinny” is such an outdated concept; too diet culture for 2025. “Flat belly” sounds better, but we’re tired of that, too. What is the trend-dependent online influencer culture to do? Enter “gut health,” the current euphemism for having a thin waist—this time with extra wellness baggage. It &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;/em&gt; like it’s all about a science-based journey toward better nutrition, but really it’s more bullshit. So let’s explore the most questionable gut health hacks out there. Grab a towel, because it’s time for your internal shower!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="taking-an-internal-shower"&gt;Taking an 'internal shower'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "internal shower" is meant to clean you from the inside. The metaphor evokes more than just relieving constipation, and implies that your guts are dirty and need to be made sparkling clean. That's not how gut health works—things should keep moving, sure, but there's no need to fully clean everything out unless you're preparing for a colonoscopy (which has its own protocol).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though “internal shower” sounds fancy, it's really just a drink that contains two full tablespoons of chia seeds, plus a squeeze of lemon. Chia seeds swell in water, forming a lumpy, gel-like texture. (This is both what makes them good in pudding, and what allows them to adhere to the terra-cotta planters of &lt;a data-ga-click="1" data-ga-template="Opinions" data-ga-module="content_body" data-ga-element="offer" data-ga-item="text-link" data-ga-event_label="Chia Pet" href="https://zdcs.link/QVX4K3?pageview_type=Standard&amp;amp;template=Opinions&amp;amp;module=content_body&amp;amp;element=offer&amp;amp;item=text-link&amp;amp;element_label=Chia%20Pet&amp;amp;short_url=QVX4K3&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flifehacker.com%2Fhealth%2Fsilliest-gut-health-trends&amp;amp;event_label=Chia%20Pet" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank" title="open in a new window"&gt;Chia Pet&lt;/a&gt; fame.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why drink them? Well, they’re high in fiber, and you also consume a glass of water in the process. In other words, it’s a trendier version of Metamucil. Be warned: the sudden increase of fiber in your diet can lead to bloating and diarrhea if you’re not used to it, but isn’t likely to be harmful otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="avoiding-cheese"&gt;Avoiding cheese&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s true that a diverse diet with plenty of plant foods is probably better for your gut than a crappy diet—but not for any game-changing, gut-specific reason. Your gut is healthy when your body is healthy, and a varied diet involving fiber and other nutrients is good for your gut microbes and for the rest of you. This amounts to “eat your vegetables,” and is thus not an exciting viral tip. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gut health advice often gives you a list of foods not to eat, or demonizes specific foods. There are no common foods known to be particularly destructive to gut health—we're built to handle just about anything—but influencers often target processed foods and dairy foods. This means that cheese has emerged as a mythically problematic food, when in fact it's probably fine—and &lt;a href="https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250303/Cheese-isnt-just-foode28094ite28099s-a-microbiome-booster-study-confirms.aspx" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;some studies suggest that it may even be particularly beneficial.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="taking-l-glutamine"&gt;Taking L-glutamine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of “gut health” has led influencers to tell you that you &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; to go out and get some L-glutamine (available in any store’s supplement aisle) to heal or prevent your leaky gut. Some of these videos include actual scientific facts about what we understand glutamine to do in the body. But that itself should set off alarm bells: When somebody talks about the mechanism of how something is &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to work, without presenting data on whether it &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; works for the intended outcome, chances are you’re on the wrong path. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;L-glutamine is an amino acid that our body can usually make for itself. There is evidence that supplementing it is helpful for people with serious bowel diseases, sepsis, injuries like extensive burns, and immune disorders. The Canadian Society for Intestinal Research &lt;a href="https://badgut.org/information-centre/health-nutrition/glutamine/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that you should consult a physician if you think you have conditions serious enough to affect your body’s ability to make enough glutamine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="anything-called-an-elixir"&gt;Anything called an "elixir" &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s an incredible depth and breadth of "gut health elixir" recipes available on TikTok and other platforms. There are gut health elixirs with &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@danalholden/video/7132270278515789102" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;aloe juice and coconut water&lt;/a&gt;, or with &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pamicakess/video/7476892094813113646" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;olive oil and lemon&lt;/a&gt;, or with &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@emselement/video/7262353622904786222" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;hibiscus and kombucha&lt;/a&gt;, or with &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@eatplantswithalana/video/7455452717121817902" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;turmeric and ashwagandha&lt;/a&gt;. What do any of these have in common? Gut health, of course. What a silly question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="washing-our-fruit-for-gut-health"&gt;Washing our fruit (for gut health)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washing your fruit is fine. Believing that unwashed fruit is the only thing standing between you and a snatched stomach—that I can't get behind. The idea is that fresh produce has pesticides on it, and those pesticides are killing your good gut bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&lt;em&gt; is&lt;/em&gt; a good idea to &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/wash-all-your-fruit-even-the-kind-you-peel-1844248118" target=""&gt;rinse fruit before you eat it&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s no link between the barely-detectable trace amounts of pesticides on fruit and the health of your gut or the size of your waistline. This isn’t a gut health tip, it’s just sensible food prep. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="pilates-for-gut-health"&gt;Pilates (for gut health)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pilates is low-key strength training. It can be good for you, as almost any exercise can, but it doesn't work miracles. I've already covered &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/why-do-so-many-tiktok-influencers-want-us-to-do-pilates-1849072506" target=""&gt;the trend of TikTok influencers making up imaginary benefits of Pilates&lt;/a&gt;, but “gut health” is a stretch. Influencers claim (as in &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@darcieratcliff/video/7237160382400400666" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;) that the breathwork and twisting motions of Pilates "massage" your gut to cure constipation, sometimes also referencing the &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/tiktok-gut-health-trend-1850844490" target="_blank"&gt;complete myth&lt;/a&gt; that we have pounds of "stuck" poop inside our guts.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="pogoClear relative my-10 border-b-[1.5px] border-t-[1.5px] border-dashed border-black py-5 sm:my-14 sm:border-0 sm:py-0" data-ga-click data-ga-template="Opinions" data-ga-module="openweb_widget" data-ga-element="openweb_scroll" data-ga-item="openweb_scroll_midpage" x-cloak x-data="{ commentsCount: null, hasComments: false }" x-init="commentsCount = await window.openweb.getMessagesCount(01JV31AQ0WPNGQ1D1R9YESP272);

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eating-30-plants-a-day"&gt;Eating 30 plants a day&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I actually like this as a hack for increasing the diversity of your diet: count up the number of plant species you eat each week, and aim to get more than you currently do. Lettuce and tomato on your sandwich? Add the wheat from the bun and you’re already up to three. This idea got its start with &lt;a href="https://www.wcrf-uk.org/our-blog/could-you-eat-30-plant-based-foods-each-week/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;research from the American Gut Project&lt;/a&gt;, which found people who ate a more varied diet had a more diverse gut microbiome—although there is no specific link to health, and scientists still haven’t found a way of determining what a “healthy” microbiome looks like. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But all of that has mutated quite a bit on social media. In one clip I remember watching, the narrator tells us that the difference between her before and after pictures is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; due to “cardio and a restrictive diet.” But she has clearly lost fat. Gut health is just the new code word for losing fat. Nearly every one of the videos I’ve highlighted here starts with a before-and-after of somebody’s soft, then toned, tummy. If it were really about “bloating,” you’d be able to see the same abs in both pictures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="going-for-a-walk-every-morning"&gt;Going for a walk every morning&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walks are good! Morning routines are good! And it’s true that your gut has its own “clock” for telling what time it is. Some influencers get it backwards, though, when they suggest getting morning light to set your gut’s clock. In truth, the gut sets its clock &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867408010672" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;based on when you feed it&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to set your gut’s clock in the morning, try eating breakfast. Like a whole, actual breakfast, not a glass of &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/lemon-water-doesn-t-do-anything-1822932908" target=""&gt;lemon water&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going for a walk may help your digestion—that's the whole idea of the "fart walk," a walk taken after dinner that &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/health/what-is-a-fart-walk" target="_blank"&gt;may relieve feelings of bloating&lt;/a&gt; and that can also help your body to control glucose levels. Feel free to take one after breakfast instead of waiting until dinnertime. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="oil-pulling"&gt;Oil pulling&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt; old thing? (I need to stop being surprised when old health trends make a comeback.) Oil pulling is when you swish coconut oil around your mouth, sometimes for up to 20 minutes, in addition to (or in place of) brushing your teeth. &lt;a href="https://lifehacker.com/oil-pulling-doesnt-out-clean-mouthwash-or-cure-all-you-1687355453" target=""&gt;It’s not particularly good at that job&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s no reason to believe it will &lt;em&gt;do anything for your gut health or your abs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="chewing"&gt;Chewing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another archaic one that keeps popping up. The idea of over-chewing your food always reminds me of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wmimhqPHkc" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;that scene in &lt;em&gt;The Road to Wellville&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where the dining hall erupts in a chorus of “Chew chew chew, that is the thing to do/Chew chew chew, good food is good for you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, your mouth produces salivary amylase to help break down your food. But there is plenty of amylase in your small intestine as well. Studies have shown potential, subtle effects of extended chewing on satiety (how hungry you feel), but the idea that you’ll get a TikTok flat belly by spending more time chewing is unsupported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/article&gt;

Chikungunya is an infection caused by the chikungunya virus and is spread by mosquitoes. File Photo courtesy the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;article itemprop="articleBody"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="story_dl"&gt;May 12 (UPI) --&lt;/span&gt; U.S. health officials are advising patients using the drug Ixchiq to hold off while authorities seek newer information on vaccine results in the global fight against chikungunya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pause for U.S. patients was initiated Friday by the FDA and CDC while the two federal agencies investigate "postmarketing reports of serious adverse events, including neurologic and cardiac events, in individuals who have received the vaccine" Ixchiq, otherwise known as live "Chikungunya Vaccine," according to a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/fda-and-cdc-recommend-pause-use-ixchiq-chikungunya-vaccine-live-individuals-60-years-age-and-older" target="_blank"&gt;safety communication&lt;/a&gt; by the U.S. &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Food_and_Drug_Administration/" target="_blank" title="Food and Drug Administration" class="tpstyle"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2023, the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2023/11/10/FDA-vaccine-chikungunya-virus/8071699627394/" target="_blank"&gt;approved Ixchiq for&lt;/a&gt; the prevention of disease caused by the chikungunya virus in patients age 18 years and older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, health officials said the FDA will conduct an updated benefit-risk assessment for the use of Ixchiq in individuals 60 years of age and older after over 80,000 doses of Ixchiq were distributed worldwide.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the start of this year, roughly 80,000 cases and 46 CHIKVD-related deaths have been reported in 14 countries or territories, &lt;a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/chikungunya-monthly#:~:text=Twelve-month%20Chikungunya%20virus%20disease,population,%20April%202024-March%202025&amp;amp;text=1%20Apr%202025-,Since%20the%20beginning%20of%202025,%20and%20as%20of%20March,%20approximately,department%20and%20region%20of%20France)." target="_blank"&gt;says the&lt;/a&gt; EU-backed European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FDA officials said as of Wednesday that 17 "serious adverse events" were reported globally in people over age 62 who got Ixchiq, with two reported deaths. Of the 17 reports, six were U.S.-based, but American health officials did not indicate if any of those deaths were in the United States.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, officials pointed out that reported adverse events "may not be causally related to vaccination."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and the symptoms &lt;a href="http://www.cdc.gov/chikungunya/symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;can last anywhere&lt;/a&gt; from one week to several months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2024/06/25/cdc-health-advisory-dengue-fever/6631719366612/" target="_blank"&gt;dengue fever&lt;/a&gt;, chikungunya virus causes high fever, rashes, headache and joint pain. And while most patients recover with days, the joint pain can persist for months that can be managed with pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory medications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But while it has the potential to temporarily disable a victim, it does not often result in death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The single-dose shot approved November 2023 by the federal government was for use in adults with an increased risk of exposure to the chikungunya virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mosquitoes can infect people with Zika and chikungunya viruses at the same time, &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2016/11/14/Mosquitoes-can-spread-Zika-Chikungunya-at-the-same-time/8681479181450/" target="_blank"&gt;research has suggested&lt;/a&gt;, and may &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2015/11/30/Mosquito-borne-chikungunya-may-cause-fatal-brain-infection/5381448917779/" target="_blank"&gt;cause fatal brain infection&lt;/a&gt; which hit 24 victims by November 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virus was &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2014/06/19/Georgia-woman-infected-with-chikungunya-virus-describes-pain/5711403179228/?spt=hn&amp;amp;or=1" target="_blank"&gt;observed and described in&lt;/a&gt; U.S. patients who traveled from the Caribbean area to Georgia and North Carolina as chikungunya &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2014/06/19/Mosquito-borne-virus-spreads-to-Cuba/7011403207907/" target="_blank"&gt;hit Cuba around&lt;/a&gt; May 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chikungunya, an illness caused by a virus spread via mosquito bites but not by person-to-person contact, was &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Health_News/2014/05/02/Chikungunya-spreading-to-other-countries-in-the-Caribbean/4561399051386/" target="_blank"&gt;first detected in the&lt;/a&gt; Americas near the end of 2013 as it swiftly spread to other Caribbean nations, Africa and Asia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, no cases have been reported on Europe's mainland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friday's federal advisory on Ixchiq arrived amid a crackdown on vaccine use and its pertinent studies lead by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a &lt;a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2025/01/29/robert-f-kennedy-confirmation-hearing/8251738077750/" target="_blank"&gt;known critic of&lt;/a&gt; effective and long-existing vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In real-life analysis of 1,000 children under 16 with severe obesity over a number of years, about a quarter of patients in 2023 were given the weight loss drug liraglutide in

semaglutide but results from these children are not yet available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Semaglutide, better known as Wegovy, and liraglutide, sold as Saxenda, are both GLP-1 receptor agonists, which help curb appetite. In the UK they are available on the NHS only for adults with a BMI above 35 with a weight-related condition, although in certain circumstances specialist paediatric clinics can prescribe them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Dr Annika Janson, of Karolinska university hospital in Sweden, the lead author of the study, whose findings were presented at the European Congress on Obesity, said the beneficial impact of weight loss jabs on children’s weight could accelerate in future years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Only a fraction of the children had GLP-1 drugs and most of those who did started on them six to 12 months into the treatment programme. Longer-term treatment may lead to greater improvements in BMI,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In addition to helping to curb hunger, families reported reduced conflicts around food and improved capacity for other lifestyle adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“It was . Portions could be downsized. For some children, not being hungry all the time is a new feeling,” Janson said. “GLP-1 receptor agonists are clearly beneficial to many children with severe obesity and, while they won’t help in all cases, more children should have access to these important medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;NHS England has announced it is rolling out “smart scales” that monitor children’s weight remotely in an attempt to “nudge” behaviour towards healthier eating habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="27d30384-d0da-43c5-a81b-7ce6dcb3b565" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":11,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Being overweight as a young child could double risk of adult obesity, research shows","elementId":"27d30384-d0da-43c5-a81b-7ce6dcb3b565","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/11/being-overweight-as-a-young-child-could-double-risk-of-adult-obesity-research-shows"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":0,"display":0,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;About 350 families are already using the technology in 15 &lt;a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/get-involved/cyp/specialist-clinics-for-children-and-young-people-living-with-obesity/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;specialist paediatric weight management clinics&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;Natural remedies for household &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/tag/pests/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with pests"&gt;pests&lt;/a&gt; have gained popularity as homeowners seek alternatives to chemical repellents. Among these solutions, one Mediterranean plant stands out for its exceptional ability to ward off &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/tag/flies/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with flies"&gt;flies&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/tag/summer/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with summer"&gt;summer&lt;/a&gt; months. This humble yet powerful herb offers an organic approach to pest control that’s both effective and sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Rue plant: the natural fly repellent from Mediterranean shores&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The common rue (Ruta graveolens), native to the Mediterranean basin, has become a valuable ally for those battling housefly invasions. This hardy perennial thrives in sunny, rocky terrain and has been cultivated for centuries not only for its medicinal properties but also for its remarkable insect-repelling capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="farmi-in-text-1" id="farmi-734428905"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="3843226833" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What makes rue particularly effective against flies is its distinctive aroma. The plant contains powerful compounds including rutin and natural citronella that flies find deeply unpleasant. Strategically placing rue plants around entry points, windowsills, or outdoor dining areas creates a natural barrier that flies actively avoid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike chemical alternatives, rue offers a sustainable solution that requires minimal maintenance. The plant’s effectiveness complements other natural pest management approaches, such as &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2024/09/14/my-neighbor-told-me-about-this-plant-that-he-placed-near-his-rose-bushes-to-keep-pests-away/"&gt;companion planting techniques that protect garden plants from common pests&lt;/a&gt;. Many gardeners discover that integrating rue into their landscape provides dual benefits of fly control and enhanced &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/tag/garden/" class="st_tag internal_tag " rel="tag" title="Posts tagged with garden"&gt;garden&lt;/a&gt; health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="farmi-display-adsense-3" id="farmi-443957131"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="9294255259" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="farmi-display-adsense" id="farmi-3723469720"&gt;

&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-7994036760405448" data-ad-slot="4875636047" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why flies become unbearable during summer months&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Summer’s warm temperatures create ideal breeding conditions for houseflies. A single female fly can lay over 500 eggs within days when conditions are favorable. These eggs are typically deposited in organic matter like food waste, improperly sealed garbage, or decaying vegetation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The combination of heat, humidity, and abundant food sources creates perfect conditions for explosive population growth. Within weeks, what started as a few harmless flies can become an overwhelming infestation that disrupts indoor comfort and outdoor activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond their nuisance factor, flies pose potential health concerns as they transfer bacteria between surfaces. This makes effective management even more important, especially during peak summer months when families spend more time outdoors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While conventional repellents offer temporary relief, they often contain chemicals that raise environmental and health concerns. Natural alternatives like rue provide effective deterrence without these drawbacks, making them ideal for households with children, pets, or &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2024/10/04/why-you-absolutely-must-grow-this-little-known-but-essential-aromatic-plant-in-your-garden/"&gt;garden enthusiasts who value essential aromatic plants&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Growing and using rue for maximum effectiveness&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rue thrives in well-drained soil and full sun exposure, making it perfectly adapted to Mediterranean-like conditions. The plant requires minimal watering once established, demonstrating remarkable drought tolerance similar to &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2024/09/23/plant-this-succulent-now-and-enjoy-a-sumptuous-flowerbed-until-the-first-frost/"&gt;certain succulents that provide beautiful blooms with minimal care&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For fly deterrence, position potted rue plants near windows, doorways, and outdoor seating areas. The plant’s natural oils will create an invisible barrier that flies instinctively avoid. For enhanced effectiveness, gently brush the foliage occasionally to release more of its aromatic compounds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rue’s pest management benefits extend beyond flies. The plant also repels moths, mites, and aphids, making it a versatile addition to any garden. When incorporated into a comprehensive garden plan, rue can contribute to a &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2024/09/10/this-dense-plant-cover-turns-out-to-be-the-ideal-solution-against-the-proliferation-of-weeds/"&gt;healthier garden ecosystem that naturally suppresses weed growth&lt;/a&gt; and promotes beneficial insect populations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Ancient remedy with multiple benefits&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rue’s usefulness isn’t limited to pest control. For centuries, traditional medicine has valued this plant for its diverse therapeutic applications. In various cultures, rue has been used to aid digestion, support liver function, and relieve menstrual discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Chilean health authorities recognize rue for its anti-parasitic properties and potential benefits for rheumatism relief. Some traditional practitioners even recommend it for skin conditions like eczema. While modern research continues to investigate these claims, rue’s historical significance in herbal medicine remains undisputed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond its medicinal applications, rue serves as an excellent companion to other plants that require protection from summer pests. Its natural deterrent properties make it an ideal addition to gardens struggling with insect pressure, similar to how &lt;a href="https://farmingdale-observer.com/2025/03/03/say-goodbye-to-mosquitoes-this-summer-plant-this-herb-in-your-garden-now/"&gt;certain herbs can effectively repel mosquitoes throughout summer months&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With its combination of pest-repelling properties and minimal maintenance requirements, the Mediterranean rue offers an elegant solution to summer’s persistent fly problem. This forgotten plant deserves renewed attention from today’s gardeners seeking natural alternatives to chemical pest control.&lt;/p&gt;

A new study reveals that these anesthetics trigger a common signature: increased phase locking at low frequencies, particularly between brain hemispheres, while disrupting local cortical communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that phase alignment—not just brain wave power—may be a universal marker of unconsciousness. Researchers propose that monitoring phase shifts could help anesthesiologists better tailor drug dosing in real time, regardless of which drug is used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Universal Signature:&lt;/strong&gt; Both ketamine and dexmedetomidine produce similar brain wave phase shifts that correlate with unconsciousness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase Locking:&lt;/strong&gt; Increased interhemispheric phase alignment and disrupted local phase coherence may indicate loss of consciousness.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Tracking brain wave phase could improve anesthetic monitoring and dosing in real time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Picower Institute at MIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the level of molecules and cells, ketamine and dexmedetomidine work very differently, but in the operating room they do the same exact thing: anesthetize the patient. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By demonstrating how these distinct drugs achieve the same result, a new study in animals by neuroscientists at The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT identifies a potential signature of unconsciousness that is readily measurable to improve anesthesiology care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-109824"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence.jpg" alt="This shows a brain and brain waves." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/consciousness-brain-waves-neurosicence-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Within each hemisphere, regardless of which anesthetic they used, brain wave phase became misaligned between the dorsolateral and ventrolateral regions of the prefrontal cortex. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What the two drugs have in common, the researchers discovered, is the way they push around brain waves, which are produced by the collective electrical activity of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When brain waves are in phase, meaning the peaks and valleys of the waves are aligned, local groups of neurons in the brain’s cortex can share information to produce conscious cognitive functions such as attention, perception and reasoning, said Picower Professor Earl K. Miller, senior author of the new study in &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When brain waves fall out of phase, local communications, and therefore functions, fall apart, producing unconsciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding, led by graduate student Alexandra Bardon, not only adds to scientists’ understanding of the dividing line between consciousness and unconsciousness, Miller said, but also could provide a common new measure for anesthesiologists who use a variety of different anesthetics to maintain patients on the proper side of that line during surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you look at the way phase is shifted in our recordings, you can barely tell which drug it was,” said Miller, a faculty member in The Picower Institute and MIT’s Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That’s valuable for medical practice.  Plus if unconsciousness has a universal signature, it could also reveal the mechanisms that generate consciousness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If more anesthetic drugs are also shown to affect phase in the same way, then anesthesiologists might be able to use brain wave phase alignment as a reliable marker of unconsciousness as they titrate doses of anesthetic drugs, Miller said, regardless of which particular mix of drugs they are using.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That insight could aid efforts to build closed-loop systems that can aid anesthesiologists by constantly adjusting drug dose based on brain wave measurements of the patient’s unconsciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller has been collaborating with study co-author Emery N. Brown, an anesthesiologist and Edward Hood Taplin Professor of Computational Neuroscience and Medical Engineering in The Picower Institute, on building such a system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent clinical trial with colleagues in Japan, Brown demonstrated that monitoring brain wave power signals using EEG enabled an anesthesiologist to use much less sevoflurane during surgery with young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reduced doses proved safe and were associated with many improved clinical outcomes including a reduced incidence of post-operative delirium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists studying anesthesia have rarely paid attention to phase, but in the new study, Bardon, Brown and Miller’s team made a point of it as they anesthetized two animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the animals lost consciousness, the measurements indicated a substantial increase in “phase locking,” especially at low frequencies. Phase locking means that the relative differences in phase remained more stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what caught the researchers’ attention were the differences that became locked in: Within each hemisphere, regardless of which anesthetic they used, brain wave phase became misaligned between the dorsolateral and ventrolateral regions of the prefrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, brain wave phase across hemispheres became more aligned, not less. But Miller notes that case is still a big shift from the conscious state, in which brain hemispheres are typically not aligned well, so the finding is a further indication that major changes of phase alignment, albeit in different ways at different distances, are a correlate of unconsciousness compared to wakefulness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The increase in interhemispheric alignment of activity by anesthetics seems to reverse the pattern observed in the awake, cognitively engaged brain,” the Bardon and Miller team wrote in &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determined by distance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distance proved to be a major factor in determining the change in phase alignment. Even across the 2.5 millimeters of a single electrode array, low-frequency waves moved 20-30 degrees out of alignment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the 20 or so millimeters between arrays in the upper (dorsolateral) and lower (ventrolateral) regions within a hemisphere, that would mean a roughly 180-degree shift in phase alignment which is a complete offset of the waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dependence on distance is consistent with the idea of waves traveling across the cortex, Miller said. Indeed in a 2022 study, Miller and Brown’s labs showed that the anesthetic propofol induced a powerful low-frequency traveling wave that swept straight across the cortex, overwhelming higher-frequency straight and rotating waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new results raise many opportunities for follow-up studies, Miller said. Does propofol (another anesthetic) also produce this signature of changed phase alignment? What role do traveling waves play in the phenomenon?

Neighboring prefrontal subregions within a hemisphere show decreased phase alignment with both drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local analyses within a region suggest that this finding could be explained by broad cortical distance-based effects, such as large traveling waves. In contrast, homologous areas across hemispheres become more aligned in phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that both anesthetics induce strong patterns of cortical phase alignment that are markedly different from those during waking and that these patterns may be a common feature driving loss of responsiveness from different anesthetic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 21:51:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibEFVX3lxTFBIeS1uOGROYnZRVFdKYW9UZjc5UVZULVpvUmI1SDNzaHFwMm91S0pCamV5T2dEcnZjRGFPc1ZWSFNTUzR2MUZOMDhsWERVQVpNdUxIeHhjeFgwUV90R3U3XzRadm9OWmdsWTBRbA</guid></item><item><title>“我们在莱姆中心” ：马里兰州兽医警告宠物主人蜱虫的威胁- WTOP | ‘We’re in Lyme central’: Maryland veterinarian warns pet owners about the threat of ticks - WTOP</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijAFBVV95cUxON0tXTkwtMmlFV0MtaXE2NXE3aHNCemZ6NDJWTFgxanVSbnNKeENndDlOdl91VzMtdjJCXzNMalpsU1RvUXNTeDh0YUZZR3BNVVl4NngzR05rNk5UNHE2cWNFZlVFNlVRTVlvc0p2V25uWE5aRlh2ZXo2NnNyYmZ5ZjNBb2lyUldfZGVtdg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="schema-summary"&gt;As the weather turns warmer a lot of us are spending more time outside, which means dog owners are on the lookout for ticks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the weather turns warmer, a lot of us are spending more time outside, which means dog owners are on the lookout for ticks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While people think of the spring and summer as tick season, a Maryland-based veterinarian said he sees more ticks in the fall months of October, November and December than he does in July and August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ticks come out all year round,” said Dr. Victor Katz, of &lt;a href="https://www.mbvets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;the Muddy Branch Veterinary Center&lt;/a&gt; in Gaithersburg. “If it gets to 32 degrees frost, they might be a little dormant, but as soon as it warms up to 35-37 degrees, they start moving around.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A dog’s ambient temperature is 101 degrees. Ticks want to be warm and can sense temperature, humidity and movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They basically hatch out and basically attach to the dogs. They just want to be warm,” Katz said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several tick-related diseases prevalent in the D.C. region, including Lyme, ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They moved the epicenter for studying Lyme disease from Hartford, Connecticut, to Derwood, Maryland, about seven years ago,” Katz said. “We are in ‘Lyme central.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katz pointed to monthly oral preventive medication, such as Simparica, Bravecto and NexGard, as the best way to keep your dogs safe from tick borne diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It does not put a bubble around the dog where it basically shoots the tick with laser beams or something like that,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if a tick bites a dog that’s on an oral preventive, it will die in about four to six hours. Transmission of some of these diseases often takes up to 10 to 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, it’s basically wiping the tick out before they get a chance to transmit enough of the disease to harm the dog,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is data, according to Katz, that shows the preventatives might increase seizure potential in some dogs. He recommended for those dogs, using a Seresto tick collar that lasts about six months and, he said, “works really well.”&lt;/p&gt;

Understanding this neural link could inform individualized treatment approaches that address both the psychiatric condition and sleep health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CSTC Dysfunction:&lt;/strong&gt; Dysregulation in the CSTC circuit may underlie both sleep and psychiatric symptoms in OCSDs, CTDs, and ADHD.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bidirectional Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Poor sleep can worsen CSTC symptoms, while CSTC disorders themselves disrupt sleep architecture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; SSRIs can treat core symptoms but may disrupt REM sleep, emphasizing the need for sleep-aware pharmacological choices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Wolters Kluwer Health&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increased sleep difficulties in patients with obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders (OCSDs), chronic tic disorders (CTDs), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are likely due to disruptions in the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) pathway, according to a narrative review in the May issue of &lt;em&gt;Harvard Review of Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margaret D. Hall at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, Erica Greenberg, MD and Kevin Gipson, MD, MS, at Massachusetts General Hospital, and colleagues also report evidence that dopamine and GABA—primary neurotransmitters in CSTC circuitry—are dysregulated in patients with these disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A better understanding of how CSTC dysregulation relates to sleep disorders could lead to more effective treatments, the reviewers say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review also confirms subjective reports of poor sleep and insomnia with CSTC-conditions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reviewers used PubMed, Google Scholar, PsychInfo, and Web of Science to search for relevant English-language articles published before August 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They defined OCSDs as including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), body-focused repetitive behavior (BFRB) disorders, and hoarding disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronic tic disorders include Tourette syndrome and chronic/persistent motor or vocal tic disorder. The team identified 42 papers: 23 on OCSDs, eight on CTDs, 10 on ADHD, and one on both CTDs and ADHD. They refer to these disorders collectively as CSTC-conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-occurring objective sleep movement disorders were consistently reported in adults with CTDs or OCD, and similar subjective findings were documented for children with OCD, ADHD, or CTDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although only a small number of studies included polysomnographic data, there was evidence of a sleep disturbance pattern with OCD, BFRB disorders, and CTDs. Subjective sleep latency problems and objective sleep spindle disruption were both common.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The evidence reviewed in this paper supports a bidirectional, additive increase in sleep and CSTC-condition symptoms,” the reviewers write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In addition to evidence that disordered sleep may be intrinsic to these CSTC-conditions, poor sleep can also impair functional connectivity and may result in structural changes in the fronto-striatal circuitry, likely further exacerbating CSTC-condition symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Determining treatments for sleep-related complaints in patients with CSTC-conditions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are three potential approaches to treating sleep disturbances in patients with CSTC-conditions, the team notes: (1) treatment of the condition, which may indirectly treat sleep-related concerns; (2) treatment of sleep, which may indirectly treat symptoms of the CSTC-condition; and (3) treatment of both approaches simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most effective approach, however, may differ from person to person, contingent on the specific condition(s) and sleep problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reviewers say careful treatment selection is particularly important for children taking medication for CSTC-conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians must weigh “the potential long-term effects of an altered sleep architecture against the substantial risks of untreated psychopathology, which comes with its own significant sequelae,” they emphasize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Identifying medications that mitigate core symptoms while stabilizing or improving sleep architecture, as opposed to exacerbating existing sleep disturbances, is a critical avenue for future research.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an example, the reviewers cite selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These medications are the first-line treatment for OCD and BDD, but they delay the onset of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and decrease the proportion of time spent in REM sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It will be important to understand if the degree to which an SSRI is helpful in treating OCD symptoms is moderated by its (positive or negative) impact on sleep architecture,” the authors note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Additionally, it will be important to explore whether these SSRI-associated sleep-related atypicalities are solely secondary to the SSRI, or perhaps would have been likely to emerge independently and secondary to the CSTC-condition itself.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this mental health and sleep research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d9b3b6aab1acb8f7bdbcaaadbcbfb8b7b699aeb6b5adbcabaab2b5acaebcabf7bab6b4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Josh DeStefano&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wolterskluwer.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Wolters Kluwer Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Josh DeStefano – Wolters Kluwer Health&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Closed access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/hrpjournal/abstract/2025/05000/disrupted_cortico_striato_thalamo_cortical.2.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Disrupted Cortico-Striato-Thalamo-Cortical Circuitry and Sleep Disturbances in Obsessive-Compulsive Spectrum, Chronic Tic, and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorders&lt;/a&gt;” by Margaret D.

Unfortunately, much of the current research to date has not employed polysomnographic methods for objective sleep-related assessments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research should further clarify the neural association between these neuropsychiatric conditions and sleep disturbances to better guide potential therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determining the most effective treatments for subjective sleep-related complaints in patients with these conditions will be crucial, particularly for determining treatment course—whether to prioritize treatment of the underlying condition, the specific sleep symptoms, or both simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 21:31:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiX0FVX3lxTE5VNHg1V1FubkcwR1k0R0NRUFFWN3FsX1VYZF9kb3phWTEwb1Z2ZnktOFBPWVpRTF92aWxaU1IzaHlTQXRWRlhua01LT1doNm9MeVphYjFwSHd2WFhfS0JV</guid></item><item><title>维京DNA有助于揭示何时出现抗HIV基因突变： 9000年前在黑海附近- Live Science | Viking DNA helps reveal when HIV-fighting gene mutation emerged: 9,000 years ago near the Black Sea - Live Science</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1AFBVV95cUxOYm40cEdPcEQ2QWdBYjRVZVhBNEg2d3ZqMk5pTDI0ZEpvWV9CTF9xRUNWOGVPaFNSWGlJU0l4SXh5T3NzSGNINm9qZnV2ZTBZN290VWFxeWpOaEFrNDZ3ekNWOGJQZ29DWEU1azN4VHpMS0FleUlJSk1lcXQ3aFA1U0hHMl94NjN5LW42dTZMQWQyMi1jX202R0JJTzJUUmxNaWNQbDNMcEs4QjQ0RFQ0dlN6WFB3OGNTN1JqYURoWWNwNkNVV2VhRVhpcjNNbTkyVklmcg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gene variant that helps protect people from HIV infection likely originated in people who lived during the span of time between the Stone Age and the Viking Age, a new study of thousands of genomes reveals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It turns out that the variant arose in one individual who lived in an area near the Black Sea between 6,700 and 9,000 years ago," &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/simon-rasmussen" target="_blank" data-url="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/simon-rasmussen" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Simon Rasmussen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a bioinformatics expert at the University of Copenhagen and co-senior author of the study, said in a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cbmr.ku.dk/news/2025/researchers-map-7000-year-old-genetic-mutation-that-protects-against-hiv/" target="_blank" data-url="https://cbmr.ku.dk/news/2025/researchers-map-7000-year-old-genetic-mutation-that-protects-against-hiv/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;statement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

However, attempts to identify its origin and trace its spread have previously come up short, since ancient genomes are often extremely fragmentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, the research team identified the mutation in 2,504 genomes from modern humans sampled for the 1000 Genomes Project, an international effort to catalog human genetic variation. Then, they created a model to search 934 ancient genomes from various regions of Eurasia ranging from the early Mesolithic period to the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/viking-history-facts-myths" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/viking-history-facts-myths"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Viking Age&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, from roughly 8000 B.C. to A.D. 1000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-6DtrKGFueCiAvELXT6UAo8" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-6DtrKGFueCiAvELXT6UAo8 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By looking at this large dataset, we can determine where and when the mutation arose," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/kirstine-johanne-theresia-ravn" target="_blank" data-url="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/kirstine-johanne-theresia-ravn" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kirstine Ravn&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen, said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team's genetic detective work revealed that the person who first carried this mutation lived near the Black Sea around 7000 B.C., around the time &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/who-were-the-first-farmers" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/who-were-the-first-farmers"&gt;&lt;u&gt;early farmers arrived in Europe&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; via Western Asia. The researchers also discovered that the prevalence of the mutation exploded between 8,000 and 2,000 years ago, suggesting it was extremely useful as people moved out of the Eurasian steppe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's findings contradict previous assumptions that the mutation emerged more recently. For instance, this means that the increase in the frequency of the mutation did not result from medieval plagues or from Viking exploration, which may have introduced pressure for humans' immune cells to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it's not being ransacked by HIV, the CCR5 protein helps control how immune cells &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925819895947" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925819895947" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;respond to signals called chemokines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, likely helping direct cells to &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5133339/" target="_blank" data-url="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5133339/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;sites of inflammation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that people who carried the special CCR5 variant had an advantage. "People with this mutation were better at surviving, likely because it dampened the &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/immune-system" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/immune-system"&gt;&lt;u&gt;immune system&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; during a time when humans were exposed to new pathogens," study co-author &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/leonardo-cobuccio" target="_blank" data-url="https://researchprofiles.ku.dk/en/persons/leonardo-cobuccio" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Leonardo Cobuccio&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Copenhagen, said in the statement. While this sounds negative, an overly aggressive immune system can be deadly, he said — when facing new germs, you want &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/immune-system/inflammation-is-a-mismatch-between-our-evolutionary-history-and-modern-environment-says-immunologist-ruslan-medzhitov" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/immune-system/inflammation-is-a-mismatch-between-our-evolutionary-history-and-modern-environment-says-immunologist-ruslan-medzhitov"&gt;&lt;u&gt;just enough of an immune response&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to subdue the threat without hurting the body itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As humans transitioned from hunger-gatherers to living closely together in agricultural societies," Cobuccio said, "the pressure from infectious diseases increased, and a more balanced immune system may have been advantageous." Of course, this is a hypothesis; the exact pressures that lead to the variant's increase aren't known for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2 id="stone-age-quiz-what-do-you-know-about-the-paleolithic-mesolithic-and-neolithic-3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/stone-age-quiz-what-do-you-know-about-the-paleolithic-mesolithic-and-neolithic" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/stone-age-quiz-what-do-you-know-about-the-paleolithic-mesolithic-and-neolithic"&gt;Stone Age quiz&lt;/a&gt;: What do you know about the Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic?&lt;/h2&gt;

Over time, their built-in repair mechanisms also fail. Knee cartilage grinds away. Hip joints no longer support weight. Treatments for breast cancer and other health issues require removal by surgery. Because the body can’t regenerate those tissues, reconstruction using biomaterials is often the only way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-1xcfe9l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, this kind of restoration involves one-size-fits-all breast implants or hip joints. More recently, 3D bioprinted tissues have begun to be tailored for patients. But these artificial tissues are printed outside of the body, and they still require additional surgeries to implant, adding to the chances of scarring, inflammation, or infection, and increasing healing time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-1xcfe9l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month, a team from the California Institute of Technology &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt0293"&gt;unveiled a system&lt;/a&gt; to 3D print tissues inside the body—no surgery needed. Dubbed deep tissue in vivo sound printing (DISP), the system uses an injectable bioink that’s liquid at body temperature but solidifies into structures when blasted with ultrasound. A monitoring molecule, also sensitive to ultrasound, tracks tissue printing in real time. Excess bioink is safely broken down by the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-1xcfe9l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In tests, the team 3D printed tissues inside a rabbit’s stomach and mouse’s bladder. They also added conductive nanoparticles to make soft biosensors and depots of medication—anticancer drugs or antibacterial medications—that released their payloads when hit with ultrasound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-1xcfe9l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work has really expanded the scope of ultrasound-based printing and shown its translational capacity,” Yu Shrike Zhang at Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the research, &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/bioprinting-inside-the-body"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;IEEE Spectrum&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s quite exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h2 css-lwaw2d"&gt;From Light to Sound&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-1xcfe9l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to its versatility, 3D printing has captured the imagination of bioengineers. The technology can be used to make artificial biological tissues, organs, or medical devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-1xcfe9l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bioprinters usually deposit one layer at a time. Each layer is solidified using light, then the next layer is laid on top of it. This layer-by-layer process takes time. More recently, an upgraded method called volumetric printing solidifies 3D structures with a single blast of carefully tailored light. The approach is faster but also constrained by how deeply light can pierce tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-1xcfe9l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infrared light, for example, can shape implants under a thin layer of skin and muscle, Xiao Kuang at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, who was not involved in the study, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adx2433"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. But light dims and scatters the deeper it goes inside the body. This limits the “direct printing of implants beneath millimeter-thick tissues”—or barely below the skin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-1xcfe9l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultrasound, best known for its use monitoring pregnancies, has an advantage here. It can reach deep into organs—nearly eight inches—without damaging them. Scientists have been exploring focused ultrasound, which blasts a certain frequency of soundwaves towards a tissue, as a way to monitor brain and muscle activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-1xcfe9l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultrasound can also trigger chemical reactions. In 2023, Zhang and colleagues &lt;a href="https://singularityhub.com/2023/12/11/ultrasonic-3d-printer-could-one-day-help-repair-organs-in-the-body-without-surgery/"&gt;engineered a molecular concoction&lt;/a&gt; dubbed “sono-ink” that solidifies when blasted with a specific frequency of sound waves. The team 3D printed multiple shapes inside isolated pork belly, liver, and kidneys and patched tissue damage in a goat heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-1xcfe9l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the ink was sensitive to stress and other disruptions in the body, resulting in slower printing and poor resolution. Sound waves also generate heat, which hardened some of the sono-ink before it had formed the intended structures. Further, other molecules in the ink and local heat spikes across tissues increased biocompatibility risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-1xcfe9l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Ultrasound 3D printing inside a body is more challenging than it seems,” wrote Kuang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h2 css-lwaw2d"&gt;A New Ink&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-1xcfe9l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new system relies on upgraded sono-ink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-1xcfe9l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ink has multiple components combined into a single concoction. First up are chains of molecules that normally float about freely but grasp each other when given a molecular cue. These are accompanied by fatty bubbles filled with binder molecules—the molecular cue—that release their payloads when exposed to ultrasound. A final encapsulated component includes multiple chemicals that scatter sound waves and light up when certain soundwaves hit. These help the team visualize the ink’s location and determine if it’s formed the desired structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-1xcfe9l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new setup “prevented premature chemical reactions at body temperature and provided better control of the printing process,” wrote Kuang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiBox-root css-0" id="content-blocks-40"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1xcfe9l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ink is injected to the target site or shuttled there using catheters. To test the approach, the team 3D printed shapes—stars, pinwheels, teardrops, and lattices—in a variety of tissues, such as thick pork chops and chicken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-1xcfe9l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to previous light-based methods that only reached fatty tissues, the new technology made it into muscles and more precisely activated the bioink to form shapes. The system works at roughly 40 millimeters a second, the average speed of an inkjet printer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h2 css-lwaw2d"&gt;A Sound Treatment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="css-1xcfe9l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mice with bladder cancer, the team 3D printed a kind of depot that slowly released anticancer drugs to stave off cancer growth. Today’s bladder cancer drugs are often flushed away within hours. A bioink patch would concentrate the drugs at the tumor for longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-1xcfe9l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another test, the researchers printed artificial tissue inches below the skin in rabbits’ leg muscles and bellies, showcasing the technology’s ability to restructure tissues in larger animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-1xcfe9l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bioink can also be customized. It can include carbon nanotubes, nanowires, and other biocompatible structures for bioengineering. In one test, the team loaded the ink with conductive nanoparticles and printed electronic sensors to measure the activity of living tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-1xcfe9l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This functionality could be useful for tests that monitor physiological signals,” wrote Kuang, such as those that monitor heart and muscle health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-1xcfe9l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ink is shelf-stable for at least 450 days and doesn’t seem to trigger immune responses. The body eliminates excess ink through normal metabolism or it can be dissolved with a treatment normally used to counter heavy-metal poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-1xcfe9l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are still some kinks to iron out. Target tissues differ in depth, shape, and size, which could alter how the ultrasound bounces and cures the bioink. Printing on organs that move—our lungs, heart, and stomach—is even more complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-1xcfe9l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this respect, AI may help, wrote Kuang. Algorithms could decipher the links between sound waves, temperature, materials, and bodily interactions to better simulate and guide printing. An AI-based controller that combines real-time monitoring of the process could rapidly adjust to changes in the body’s status so the bioink solidifies as planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-1xcfe9l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although there’s a ways to go before clinical use, the team says their recent work shows the technology is versatile enough to be widely useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>SingularityHub</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 21:18:20 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiuAFBVV95cUxOaGJDNjRha2x0dzF5YWhuRFFIRk9qbG1haXBWYmF3WmtmTkxxU28zMEVBZjJKRVJZN3NNeGQ4S1RLVC1RRHYtdjRQb1EzazRtb21kWWhNN2ZoTTV2WmZsUm5rTEdPY1VBQlBuUTJVNlF5dGh5SGZ2QzNRMndHOHRHSUpZMnBxR0NGaEIxSzluOENRY09OcEd6TzdIWUsyT1NxbUJFMjJaR1RJTkxoWWZTek9SeUZneWNm</guid></item><item><title>大脑如何分割空间，使其感知能力加倍-神经科学新闻 | How Your Brain Splits Space to Double Its Perception Power - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE1qNjFLZzF3am92Z2JKQmdiQkZ0cXZJVWFoclRwdTZYT2VsMVktanU5SWZnWnhpZXN2eWZJNHZlM2JoOHJMZlUtZlYwSWxLVEtBYzk0WUdsbW12UEdsTnpRei1nQTFsLWNwTnpVX1p5QW0?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Despite popular myths about left- and right-brain thinking, research shows the hemispheres truly do divide up certain tasks—especially visual spatial perception. A new review reveals how each hemisphere processes the opposite side of your field of vision, not only early on but even in higher-level cognition like attention and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This separation gives us a “bilateral advantage,” increasing our capacity to track multiple objects across the visual field. The brain seamlessly coordinates the handoff of information between hemispheres, avoiding confusion as objects move across our gaze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bilateral Advantage:&lt;/strong&gt; Dividing visual input across both hemispheres improves object-tracking capacity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spatial-Only Split:&lt;/strong&gt; The hemispheric divide applies to spatial info, not features like color or shape.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seamless Coordination:&lt;/strong&gt; Brain hemispheres “handoff” visual targets like cell towers switching a call.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Picower Institute at MIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People have a lot of misconceptions about what the brain’s left and right hemispheres do, but one well-known aspect of this division may be even more true than people realize: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain not only splits up visual spatial perception—processing what’s on our left in the right hemisphere and what’s on our right in the left hemisphere—it takes cognitive advantage of that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;p class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt; &lt;iframe title="The Brain’s Hemispheres and the Architecture of Perception" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tvTmM9h15yg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Neuroscience" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Neuroscience News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new review by MIT neuroscientists explains what the field has learned about this division of labor, the trade-off it involves and how the brain ultimately bridges the divide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People hear all these myths about the left brain being more analytical and the right brain being more artistic, or people being right-brained vs left-brained. Ninety-nine percent of that is nonsense,” said paper co-author Earl K. Miller, Picower Professor in The Picower Institute for Learning and Memory and the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You think with your whole brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to visual spatial perception, the brain has evolved separate neural resources for the right vs left sides of gaze even in later stages of cognitive processing, Miller said. Why? To optimize its capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s for good reason,” said Miller, who co-authored the new review in the journal &lt;em&gt;Neuropsychologia &lt;/em&gt;with Picower Institute research scientist Scott Brincat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Perceptual capacity is limited—you can only take in so much at once. If you’re your capacity is fully tied up on the right side of your gaze, you might miss a threat approaching on the left. Splitting resources between both sides helps avoid dangerous perceptual blind spots”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Separated sight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Miller was in graduate school, he said, he was taught that the brain neatly divided its visual perception of space between hemispheres until the information reached the prefrontal cortex where it became seamlessly blended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But experiments by Miller and Brincat, as well as many other researchers, have been accumulating evidence to refine that view over the last 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These studies have shown that even in the prefrontal cortex, neural encoding of information about where an object is, is still biased toward the “contralateral” hemisphere, or the hemisphere opposite of where the object appears in the field of view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a result, the two hemispheres appear to function surprisingly independently, even for high-level cognitive functions like attention and working memory,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence is apparent in measurements of the brain waves produced by coordinated networks of neurons in each hemisphere. Gamma frequency wave power increases in frontal brain hemispheres when they consider the visual stimuli that appear on the contralateral side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, studies for decades (including one in 1971) have shown that people and animals can remember more things if their presentation is split between hemispheres rather than presented all on one side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroscientists call this the “bilateral advantage,” though it is not perfect. People don’t track multiple things, even if split across both sides, as well as they track just one thing on either side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People also exhibit individualized differences in perceptual capacity across the visual field. Miller has founded the startup company SplitSage to measure these differences with the goal of helping people with visually oriented complex tasks to improve their performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, the studies that Brincat and Miller review in the new paper show that the split bias between hemispheres applies only to spatial information—the &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; something is. Other features like color or shape are processed by both hemispheres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seamless sight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the brain maintains a separation in its processing of spatial visual perception, even at the stage of allocating attention and juggling objects in working memory, why aren’t we confused or surprised when a bird flying from our left passes into the right side of our field of view? We also easily handle cases where our shifting gaze moves an object from one eye’s field of view to the other’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We experience a seamless world,” Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the brain accomplishes the “handoff” from one hemisphere to the other much like two cellular towers do for your phone as you drive around, according to neural activity measurements in studies such as one in 2014 and one that Brincat and Miller led in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a tracked target approaches the visual midline, the hemisphere about to receive the target shows a ramp-up of activity well before the crossing time, as if it is anticipating the target,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Further, activity in the sending hemisphere remains high well after the crossing. Thus, for up to a second or more, neural signals reflecting the target are shared across both hemispheres. It is as if both hemispheres are holding the baton.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with the “bilateral advantage,” there is a small performance cost when this transfer happens, studies show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deficits in interhemispheric connectivity or synchrony are apparent in neurological and psychiatric diseases including Alzheimer’s, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and autism spectrum disorders, the authors note. Brincat and Miller’s review emphasizes that such disruptions could affect cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A foundational understanding of interhemispheric processing, combined with interventions translatable to human patients offers hope for developing novel network-level treatments,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this visual neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#640005120d000e0b24090d104a010011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;David Orenstein&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://mit.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Picower Institute at MIT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;David Orenstein – Picower Institute at MIT&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2025.109153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Cognitive independence and interactions between cerebral hemispheres&lt;/a&gt;” by Scott Brincat et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neuropsychologia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cognitive independence and interactions between cerebral hemispheres&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two cerebral hemispheres can often operate independently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But interactions between them are critical for cognition and have been implicated in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurophysiological studies have long focused on a single hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we review recent studies showing neurophysiological evidence showing both independence and interactions between the hemispheres during complex behavior.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 21:08:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE1qNjFLZzF3am92Z2JKQmdiQkZ0cXZJVWFoclRwdTZYT2VsMVktanU5SWZnWnhpZXN2eWZJNHZlM2JoOHJMZlUtZlYwSWxLVEtBYzk0WUdsbW12UEdsTnpRei1nQTFsLWNwTnpVX1p5QW0</guid></item><item><title>加拉廷县麻疹病例更新- KBZK新闻 | Gallatin County measles cases update - KBZK News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMifkFVX3lxTFBOdU9RY1lBSXctaXJnUy1mNF90OHlNZnVjNGxibVc3YVdtSWhqeW5wSWlrRmFKMkt2bUFQa2c3TUY5eDhkLUlrYjhFLTM1Y3NybG5ncEZ1aFlvNlpxZ1NYZWlnNUgwLXZXMlZLbTlDeGZ2RXZldG9hZTBCUFFEZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="RichTextArticleBody-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOZEMAN—The Gallatin City-County Health Department reported today that all eight cases of measles reported in April have recovered, and the individuals are no longer isolated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Watch how health officials responded to measles cases confirmed in Gallatin County&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="VideoEnhancement" data-video-disable-history&gt;

It has not yet been peer-reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants, all healthcare workers, were asked to assess self-reported COVID-19–attributed symptoms lasting at least 12 weeks, classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on perceived symptom intensity.&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Results were compared with COVID controls (infected participants without long COVID) and with non-COVID controls (uninfected participants).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among all online respondents, 17.0% said they had experienced persistent symptoms following COVID-19 infections, similar to the 15.9% of telephone respondents. Forty-three percent of respondents with long COVID said their case was moderate, and 33% classified their long COVID as severe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common symptoms among those with long COVID were fatigue, shortness of breath, neurocognitive symptoms, post-exertional malaise, and smell or taste disturbances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk 15% after first infection, 6% after second&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cumulative risk of long COVID increased with the number of reported COVID-19 infections, rising from 13.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.1% to 14.4%) for a single infection to 37.0% (95% CI, 33.0% to 40.9%) for three infections in the online survey, and from 11.8% (a single infection) to 29.5% (≥3 infections) in the telephone survey, according to the authors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With both surveys combined, the risk of long COVID was two to three times higher after the initial infection (14.8%) than after first (5.8%) or second (5.3%) reinfections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Severe symptoms were reported 5 to 22 times more often by long COVID cases than by COVID controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Severe symptoms were reported 5 to 22 times more often by long COVID cases than by COVID controls, except for fever, cough, insomnia, anxiety, and depression (2.7 to 4.5 times)," the authors wrote.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risk for long COVID was highest following infections with the ancestral strain and lowest after Omicron infections. However, because Omicron caused such widespread transmission, that strain was associated with the most long-COVID cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our study indicates that long COVID risk is roughly two thirds lower following reinfection compared to first infection," the authors said. "This may be partly related to greater host-specific resistance among individuals who did not have long COVID following their first episode."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annual flu shots could become a thing of the past under a new vaccine strategy developed and tested by University of Nebraska–Lincoln virologist Eric Weaver and his laboratory team.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Research findings &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59182-7" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/i&gt; reveal a possible breakthrough. The study, "Epitope-Optimized Vaccine Elicits Cross-Species Immunity Against Influenza A Virus," describes a vaccine that protects against H1N1 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/swine+flu/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;swine flu&lt;/a&gt; and can also protect against influenza in humans and birds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This research sets the stage for developing universal influenza vaccines so people won't have to go to the doctor and get a flu shot every year," Weaver said. "This vaccine will protect you against the different strains that are out there."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swine vaccinated with the immunogens designed in Weaver's laboratory exhibited no signs of illness after being exposed to a commonly circulating flu strain; developed antibodies against a multitude of viruses from several decades and multiple species; and maintained their immune response throughout the six-month &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/longitudinal+study/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;longitudinal study&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Post-experiment &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/regression+analysis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;regression analysis&lt;/a&gt; indicated that the immunity would not dissipate for a decade, Weaver said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Epigraph vaccine, named after the computer software used to design it, significantly outperformed a commercial vaccine used by the pork industry and a "wild type" vaccine based on naturally occurring strains with similar immunogens.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The newly published results confirm previous research that demonstrated the vaccine design protected against the H3 influenza subtype. The new results are particularly encouraging, Weaver said, because H1 swine flu variants are detected twice as often as H3 variants—and have nearly three times more genetic diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"This H1 subtype is the largest and most genetically diverse subtype in pigs," Weaver said. "It's also among the viruses that jumped from swine to humans to cause the 2009 swine flu pandemic. It's a big target and one of the harder targets to hit."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The influenza A virus regularly infects as much as 15% of the human population and causes thousands of deaths each year. Current vaccines often fail to provide long-lasting protection because of the genetic diversity and rapid mutation of proteins that help form the virus. The H1 and H3 subtypes, for example, reflect different mutations of hemagglutinin, the molecules of protein and carbohydrate that coat the surface of a virus and enable it to infiltrate the body's cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another challenge in controlling influenza is that it infects multiple species: birds, swine, horses and dogs, along with humans. Swine often act as a mixing vessel because they are susceptible to human and bird flu variants, contributing to the evolution of novel forms of the disease that can be transmitted back to humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2009 swine flu pandemic, for example, resulted from a zoonotic transmission from hogs to humans. About 25% of the human population was infected with the new variant and more than half a million people died from it in the first year, according to some estimates. The 1918 Spanish Flu, 1957 Asian Flu and 1968 Hong Kong Flu pandemics also resulted from cross-species transmission to humans.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;"If we can prevent influenza in swine, we can also prevent zoonotic jumps from avians to swine to humans, or from swine directly to humans. We could basically cut off this evolutionary arsenal or advantage that the virus has," Weaver explained. "The ultimate goal is to eliminate or eradicate influenza."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weaver's vaccine strategy, which has been patented, used the Epigraph software to analyze the genetic codes of more than 6,000 strains of influenza virus occurring from 1930 to 2021 and create a vaccine cocktail representing their most common epitopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epitopes are regions on a virus that trigger the immune system to produce antibodies to neutralize the virus and to send T-cells to destroy infected cells. As the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/virus/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;virus&lt;/a&gt; evolves, some epitopes disappear, thus evading the immune response. The computationally derived Epigraph strategy increases the likelihood that the vaccine contains the epitopes needed to trigger an &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/immune+response/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;immune response&lt;/a&gt; and prevent illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data analysis showed the vaccines provided protection for human influenza varieties that emerged during the last 20 years and for swine influenza varieties that emerged over the past century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"That's an incredibly powerful thing," Weaver said. "The ultimate goal would be to have a significant impact on the disease burden in our society."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Weaver said he believes vaccine science is on the precipice of a major leap forward, thanks in part to improvements in gene sequencing technology and databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Our ability to understand how viruses evolve has increased exponentially in the past 20 years," he said. "What I see on the horizon is a third wave, where we go from good vaccines to universal lifelong vaccines."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the swine study, four groups of five pigs were vaccinated with Epigraph, wild type, commercial or sham vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional antibodies were measured against four swine flu clades, including the 2009 swine flu pandemic variant, two representative human H1N1 strains from the 2009 pandemic and a representative bird flu strain. Epigraph-vaccinated pigs reached threshold immunity levels for all 12 strains tested, while wild type-vaccinated pigs showed immunity against eight of 12 strains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commercially vaccinated pigs had antibody responses three to five times lower than those observed in the Epigraph and wild type-vaccinated pigs, reaching threshold levels in only six of 12 strains tested. Importantly, the swine study also showed that the Epigraph vaccine induced significantly higher T-cell responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next steps include testing a vaccine to protect against both H1 and H3 strains of &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/influenza/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;influenza&lt;/a&gt;. Weaver hopes eventually to form a partnership with a biotechnology company to pursue a human vaccine. Although the results so far have been gratifying, Weaver said he is eager to see if other scientists confirm his results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We do the most stringent controls that we can possibly do, because we want to be absolutely certain—and I have no doubt that this &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/vaccine/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;vaccine&lt;/a&gt; is better than the current vaccines," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;        &lt;/figure&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A drug to treat migraine, ubrogepant, is also found to reduce common non-headache symptoms that occur in the hours preceding a migraine headache, according to the results of a large phase three clinical trial &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03679-7" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/i&gt;. The findings suggest that ubrogepant may be the first acute treatment for the symptoms that occur before migraine, which have a considerable impact on daily function.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;Several symptoms can occur before a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/migraine+headache/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;migraine headache&lt;/a&gt;, including aura and premonitory (prodromal) symptoms—also known as early-onset symptoms—such as &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/sensitivity/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;sensitivity&lt;/a&gt; to light and sound, nausea, &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neck+pain/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neck pain&lt;/a&gt; and dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although most &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/migraine/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;migraine&lt;/a&gt; research has focused on treating headaches, no treatments have shown efficacy in alleviating early premonitory symptoms that often last for hours and can cause considerable dysfunction for people with migraine. Ubrogepant is a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/drug/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;drug&lt;/a&gt; that blocks the CGRP receptor on neurons, which are responsible for the transmission of pain, but its potential ability to treat premonitory symptoms of migraine had been unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Goadsby and colleagues analyzed the effectiveness of ubrogepant as a &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/treatment/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;treatment&lt;/a&gt; for premonitory symptoms in 438 participants 18–75 years of age with at least a one-year history of migraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were split into two groups for a double-blind study, and took a 100-milligram dose of either ubrogepant or a placebo once initial premonitory symptoms started, during which the participant was confident a headache would follow within one to six hours. During a second prodromal event at least seven days later, participants took the opposite treatment (ubrogepant or placebo).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goadsby and colleagues found that when participants received ubrogepant, they self-reported improvements in their ability to concentrate one hour after treatment, reduced sensitivity to light two hours after treatment, and reduced fatigue and neck pain after three hours, compared with the placebo-treated group. Dizziness and sensitivity to sound symptoms were also reduced in ubrogepant-treated participants between four and 24 hours after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that ubrogepant may be an effective treatment for common premonitory symptoms, with improvements beginning possibly as early as one hour after dosing. However, additional studies specifically designed to evaluate the effect of acute treatment on prodromal symptoms are needed.&lt;/p&gt;

However, there are some things that, though seemingly small, may require a second opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt; spoke to Dr Lori Solomon, chair of the Department of Family and Community Medicine at New York Medical College, and Dr Estelle Williams, ​​medical director for CityMD for the southern New Jersey region to get their thoughts on which symptoms should really not be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="article-im-prompt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Going to the bathroom too frequently&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waking up in the middle of the night needing to pee is totally normal, Solomon tells &lt;em&gt;The Independent.&lt;/em&gt; But if that’s something you’re doing two or three times per night – every night – that might be indicative of a more serious problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over-frequent urination can be a &lt;a href="/topic/symptom"&gt;symptom&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="/topic/diabetes"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. “When your sugar is high, one of the ways the body tries to get rid of the sugar, is to get rid of it through the urine,” Soloman says. “During the day, you just go to the bathroom more often, but at nighttime, you often have to wake up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-ii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 eGgKya"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/01/22/22/iStock-1768701808.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/01/22/22/iStock-1768701808.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/01/22/22/iStock-1768701808.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Simple things such as needing to go to the bathroom frequently at night, or pain that causes you to wake up, may be a sign of something more serious that should be checked out by a medical professional" class="sc-1mc30lb-0 QHifS inline-gallery-btn"&gt;&lt;p class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0 sc-482ou5-1 eZtLil" data-component="AutoGalleryButton" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;button class="sc-1uf4o3q-0 fsbheq inline-gallery-btn" id="trigger-autogallery-36957"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-1uf4o3q-1 jEeRhv"&gt;open image in gallery&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-1cbdeug-1 sc-1cbdeug-3 kBlcBC kIlksO"&gt;Simple things such as needing to go to the bathroom frequently at night, or pain that causes you to wake up, may be a sign of something more serious that should be checked out by a medical professional&lt;span class="sc-1cbdeug-7 hAhJPR"&gt; (Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams agrees, adding that other worrying signs can be feeling more thirsty and a significant increase in appetite. “Those are the types of things I think need to be checked sooner rather than later,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pain in the night&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any pain that wakes you up during the night could be a problem. While pulled muscles, physical injuries, or other discomforts may hinder someone getting to sleep – they shouldn’t be disturbing you once you’re asleep, Solomon says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you're waking up in the middle of the night with a headache, you've got a problem… because usually we don't wake up with headaches in the middle of the night,” she says. “If that's waking you up at night – I'm a little bit more worried about that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sudden headaches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headaches are “super common,” and shouldn’t necessarily be considered worrisome, Solomon says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, if a headache is accompanied by other things such as vision changes, nausea tingling in the extremities, weakness – those may be a sign that something neurological is going on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams cautions those who jump to label sudden, severe headaches as &lt;a href="/topic/migraines"&gt;migraines&lt;/a&gt;. “A migraine is actually a very specific &lt;a href="/topic/diagnosis"&gt;diagnosis&lt;/a&gt; and headache pattern, requiring neurologic evaluation,” she says. “It's good that you get evaluated if you're having a headache that's unusual for you, if it’s very intense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 jIjruH"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/01/22/41/iStock-2132184395.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/01/22/41/iStock-2132184395.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/01/22/41/iStock-2132184395.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="Headaches are super common, but if you’re experiencing extra symptoms including nausea, vision changes or weakness this can be a sign of something else.

I was just doing my regular activities and I became very winded and short of breath,’ get that checked,” she says. “I would also say, if you take a deep breath and you develop pain in your chest or your back that you've never had before, that can sometimes be a soft sign for a &lt;a href="/topic/blood-clot"&gt;blood clot&lt;/a&gt; in the lungs, called a pulmonary embolism, that we certainly want to see for sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/topic/fatigue"&gt;Fatigue&lt;/a&gt; too – while common in many people due to hectic work schedules or other lifestyle commitments – should not be significantly interfering with things you would do day-to-day such as exercising, Solomon adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In very severe cases, fatigue can be symptomatic of &lt;a href="/topic/heart-disease"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, sleep apnea, and even some cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indigestion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is one less obvious and very typical symptom of heart disease. “It's very common for people who are having a &lt;a href="/topic/heart-attack"&gt;heart attack&lt;/a&gt; to think they're having indigestion,” Solomon says. “If you’re taking a walk and all of a sudden you feel like, ‘Oh, I’ve got some indigestion’, and then it gets better when you stop walking, that's your heart.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A combination of fatigue and indigestion, unconnected to a big meal, is something that people should see the doctor about, she says. It could be due to a lack of blood flow to the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams says that bouts of indigestion-like symptoms – pressure or tightness – that last for 15 minutes or 20 minutes can be telling, especially for those who do not typically suffer from indigestion or heartburn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes people think ‘Oh, I just ate something weird, and I must have a bubble of gas in my chest,” she says. “That sensation of indigestion is something that can be an indicator of heart disease… It can be a masker of something more serious.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood in your stool&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitor your bowels, says Williams, because being constipated or having diarrhea is something that's different is worth getting checked out. And while it may seem obvious, seeing blood in either your poop or pee is definitely something to see a doctor about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re having a change of bowel habits – if you see black stool or a lot of blood when you’re using the restroom, I feel like that's perhaps not a subtle sign,” William says. “That's something a little more concerning that means you should come in.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People often associate blood in the stool as a hemorrhoid, but should not be ignored as it can be a common presentation for &lt;a href="/topic/colon-cancer"&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;, according to Solomon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In general you generally don't want to see blood in the urine either,” she says. “But that's usually &lt;a href="/topic/kidney-stones"&gt;kidney stones&lt;/a&gt; or urinary tract infections.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-kk992l-0 bNYvfb"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistent symptoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solomon also warns people to pay attention when things just don’t clear up on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If there's a cough lasting more than four weeks, you generally want to see somebody about that,” Solomon says. “There's lots of reasons you can have a cough, but generally, if you have a cough after a cold, it generally goes away in a few weeks. So if it lasts longer than a month, we generally want to know about that.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Williams agrees, adding that things that have been happening for months that may seem innocuous may still be worth investigating. Losing weight unintentionally is definitely something worth mentioning to your primary care doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="sc-482ou5-2 hCNBSR sc-482ou5-3 image align-center"&gt;&lt;figure class="sc-1cbdeug-0 hXrpsW"&gt;&lt;div data-gallery-length="4" class="sc-482ou5-0 ccMPxj"&gt;&lt;img src="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/01/22/56/iStock-1715472524.jpg" srcset="https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/01/22/56/iStock-1715472524.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=320&amp;amp;auto=webp 320w, https://static.the-independent.com/2025/05/01/22/56/iStock-1715472524.jpg?quality=75&amp;amp;width=640&amp;amp;auto=webp 640w" loading="lazy" alt="There are many reasons that a person can get a cough, though most generally go away in a week or so following a cold.

She encourages people to be over, rather than under-cautious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes people feel silly about coming in with all these different symptoms, but I don’t think we could expect that people are going to know everything that doctors know,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I'd rather say it’s nothing and reassure them than miss something that could be really serious if we didn't catch it in time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 May 2025 19:40:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0gFBVV95cUxQempTOWRjck1tejh2UmEtVVR5SE9VbUhwUnNuYXRlZjNKT2VIazBLRU1TTVV5Y0Q3SHZ0RjNQMHNFVlNobVBEZjVaNnNvRDJrU1AxbFhDOVJCcXhRMUt4c0Y2Tjl1cU9XVkh3SUR4TUhVWnA4LUJDXzFMamJMR3NRZTZzMWxlZkRHQ05nWDA4QkhCMVJSNEJlbUhOTk9pZFdiM3pQV3A0X2puY0ZSZUNKblhYOHJ6U2tQLU80RlI5MzZxTzZTRGpKVmhWUjFuV0pYNHc</guid></item></channel></rss>
