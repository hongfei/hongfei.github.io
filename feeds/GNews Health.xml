			&lt;p&gt;Exercise is a cornerstone of good health and evidence shows it can even help &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/exercise-proves-powerful-in-preventing-colon-cancer-recurrence-new-study-257983"&gt;prevent cancers returning&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2502760"&gt;following treatment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But new findings are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/health/running-colon-cancer.html"&gt;raising an unexpected question&lt;/a&gt;: could very high-volume endurance training carry its own risks?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting, researchers from Inova Schar  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="172173" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Cancer&lt;/a&gt; Institute reported that a surprising number of dedicated marathon and ultramarathon runners had precancerous growths in their colons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/your-brain-might-start-eating-itself-during-strenuous-endurance-exercise"&gt;Your Brain Might Start 'Eating Itself' During Strenuous Endurance Exercise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 100 athletes aged 35 to 50, &lt;a href="https://www.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/ABSTRACT491966"&gt;15% had advanced adenomas&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/nejmra1513581"&gt;lesions&lt;/a&gt; that can develop into bowel cancer – while 41% had at least one adenoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is small and not yet peer-reviewed, but the signal is strong enough to have &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14768309/colon-cancer-running-asco-2025.html"&gt;captured&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/health/running-colon-cancer.html"&gt;global&lt;/a&gt; attention. Here's what the findings really mean, why experts urge caution in interpreting the results, and what runners should watch for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first glance, it seems counterintuitive. &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/five-ways-to-cut-your-risk-of-cancer-by-an-oncology-consultant-245858"&gt;Decades of evidence&lt;/a&gt; show regular exercise &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6527123/"&gt;lowers cancer risks&lt;/a&gt;, including bowel cancer, and improves outcomes &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/59/14/1010"&gt;after a cancer diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172180" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172180" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer2_642.jpg" alt="woman running" class="wp-image-172180 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer2_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer2_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer2_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172180" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Exercise reduces risks of many cancers. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MABqghXaI2U/"&gt;Jacob Lund/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study doesn't overturn that science. Instead, it suggests a narrow group of young, very high–volume endurance athletes might face unique bowel stress that could increase their odds of developing precancerous changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/colon-cancer-rates-are-rising-among-young-people-could-changes-to-childrens-gut-bacteria-explain-why-255176"&gt;Young people with colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; has been called a new  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pandemic" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73047" data-postid="172173" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;epidemic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/bowel-cancer-is-on-the-rise-in-under-50s-heres-what-might-explain-the-trend-246447"&gt;we don't really understand&lt;/a&gt; why it's &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/alcohol-plays-a-major-role-in-new-cancer-cases/"&gt;increasing&lt;/a&gt; so much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Inova study deliberately excluded people with known genetic conditions or bowel disease to focus on runners who otherwise seemed low risk. Yet their screening found more advanced lesions than expected for that age group – a pattern outside experts, commenting in the New York Times, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/health/running-colon-cancer.html"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; as worth investigating, not a final answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How might heavy endurance training contribute to bowel changes? One theory focuses on temporary blood flow reductions to the gut during prolonged, intense exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distance runners are familiar with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5675973/"&gt;runner's colitis&lt;/a&gt; – cramping and occasional bleeding after long runs. Repeated cycles of low–oxygen stress, inflammation and tissue repair in the bowel could, theoretically, encourage adenoma development in susceptible people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Inova team highlighted this mechanism based on observations and runners' reports of gut symptoms, though the study didn't directly measure blood flow, oxygen or inflammation markers. It also didn't isolate other lifestyle factors that might matter, such as dehydration strategies, anti–inflammatory drug use, specific nutrition practices, or very low body fat levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as important is what this study doesn't establish. It doesn't prove marathons or ultramarathons cause bowel cancer. It doesn't show most young–onset bowel cancers occur in runners – doctors not involved in the study &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/health/running-colon-cancer.html"&gt;emphasised&lt;/a&gt; that most younger patients with these cancers aren't endurance athletes. And it doesn't address whether more moderate exercise carries similar risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comparison point – the expected rate of &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1309086"&gt;advanced adenomas&lt;/a&gt; in the late 40s – comes from broader population studies, not from a matched control group. That makes the observed difference notable but still preliminary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research is clinically grounded, but its size and design mean it should be seen as a starting point for larger studies rather than a basis for changing general &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/coping/physically/exercise-guidelines"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040842825001064"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there are practical lessons for endurance athletes and doctors. First, persistent blood in stool, changes in bowel habits, unexplained stomach pain, or iron–deficiency anaemia shouldn't be dismissed as "just running".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a community where gut complaints are common and often normalised, it's easy to miss warning signs. The lead oncologist argued that young runners with bleeding after long runs should be offered screening – a stance grounded in the fact that colonoscopy can remove precancerous lesions and prevent cancers developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is more cautious than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/colorectal-cancer/screening/index.html"&gt;current guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for average–risk adults but aligns with individualised, symptom–driven care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, the study reinforces the difference between exercise as medicine and exercise as extreme sport. For &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38920329/"&gt;cancer prevention and overall health&lt;/a&gt;, the strongest &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-024-02748-x"&gt;evidence supports regular&lt;/a&gt;, moderate–to–vigorous &lt;a href="https://cancerci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12935-022-02670-3"&gt;activity&lt;/a&gt;, not necessarily repeated ultra–endurance feats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172178" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172178" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer_642.jpg" alt="bowel polyp" class="wp-image-172178 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer_642-592x415.jpg 592w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/endurance_cancer_642-600x421.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172178" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Polyps can be removed during a colonoscopy. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAFwwWUduCY/"&gt;Sebastian Kaulitzki/Science Photo Library/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Careful attention needed – not panic&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent conferences highlighted data showing structured exercise after bowel cancer treatment improves long–term outcomes, underlining that physical activity remains one of the most powerful, low–cost tools in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6527123/"&gt;cancer prevention and care&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This runner study doesn't contradict that larger story. It flags a potential exception at the extreme end of training that needs careful attention, not panic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If future research confirms a link, what might change? Screening recommendations could evolve for a clearly defined group of high–volume endurance athletes, perhaps starting colonoscopy earlier than the current age–45 threshold for average–risk adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Athletes and coaches might adapt training, nutrition and recovery to protect gut health – paying attention to hydration, heat stress, gradual progression, and avoiding unnecessary anti–inflammatory medication around long efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sports medicine and gastroenterology clinics might work together on protocols for evaluating gut bleeding in runners, narrowing the gap between &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10116569/"&gt;"common" and "concerning"&lt;/a&gt; symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But these steps depend on replication in larger, diverse groups and understanding which components of endurance life – intensity, duration, heat, altitude, nutrition – matter most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, a balanced message serves the public best. Endurance running is a profound source of meaning and health for many people, and quitting running isn't the lesson from a single small study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key is keeping the proven benefits of exercise in view while being clear–eyed about potential risks at extremes. Listen to your body's signals, especially bleeding. Treat red–flag symptoms as medical, not merely athletic. And discuss personal risk factors and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4955831/"&gt;family history&lt;/a&gt; with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As science probes this signal further, the likely outcome isn't a blanket warning but more nuanced guidance: who might need earlier screening, when to investigate symptoms, and how to train hard with the gut in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study's real contribution may be cultural as much as clinical: it gives runners and doctors permission to ask a question they've too often waved away, and to catch dangerous lesions before they become cancers.&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/263564/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" loading="lazy"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strokes are a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/facts.htm" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929758" data-affiliate="true"&gt;leading cause of death in the US&lt;/a&gt;, with nearly 800,000 people experiencing one every year. On average, a stroke occurs every 40 seconds in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These numbers are jarring and scary, especially for folks who have a family history of stroke or who have risk factors like high blood pressure and certain heart conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you can arm yourself with knowledge to recognize the symptoms of a stroke, understand the risk factors and ultimately help protect yourself from experiencing one altogether. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://nyulangone.org/doctors/1649629932/brandon-giglio" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929758" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Brandon Giglio&lt;/a&gt;, the director of vascular neurology at NYU Langone Hospital—Brooklyn, about 85% of strokes in the United States are ischemic strokes, meaning they’re caused by a lack of blood flow to the brain. About 15% are hemorrhagic strokes, which occur when a blood vessel ruptures in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And among the people who have strokes, many also experience what is known as a warning stroke in the days, weeks or months beforehand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what to know about warning strokes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning strokes are known medically as transient ischemic attacks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to most people outside of the medical field, warning strokes are a fleeting yet very dangerous medical condition that can be precursors to full-blown strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, up to one in five people who experience a warning stroke could have a stroke within 90 days if they don’t get medical attention, according to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/24305-ahmed-itrat" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929758" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Ahmed Itrat&lt;/a&gt;, the stroke medical director at Cleveland Clinic Akron General.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what exactly is a warning stroke? Medically, it’s referred to as a transient ischemic attack and causes “sudden-onset transient symptoms of neurological injury which resolve on their own,” Itrat said. “These symptoms may be similar to what one would consider a stroke, but the only difference is they don’t lead to a permanent neurological injury.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, transient ischemic attacks come on quickly, last for a short time, and do not result in the type of brain damage that can be seen with full-fledged strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the lack of potential brain damage does not mean you should ignore a transient ischemic attack. It’s still a medical condition that needs to be taken seriously, Giglio said. “It really is a harbinger in many people for someone who is going to have a stroke even within the next 48 hours and certainly within the next seven, 30, 90 days,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transient ischemic attacks are also commonly referred to as “ministrokes.” But &lt;a href="https://www.neurology.columbia.edu/profile/joshua-z-willey-md" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929758" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Joshua Willey&lt;/a&gt;, a stroke neurology expert at Columbia University’s Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, said this problematic term minimizes the emergent nature of the condition. The phrase “warning strokes,” on the other hand, highlights that this condition is an emergency, just like a “regular” stroke, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The signs of transient ischemic attacks and strokes are the same.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I would say that basically all the same signs and symptoms of a stroke are the signs and symptoms of a transient ischemic attack,” Giglio said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All three experts who spoke with HuffPost referred to “&lt;a href="https://www.nm.org/healthbeat/healthy-tips/stroke-warning-signs" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929758" data-affiliate="true"&gt;BE FAST&lt;/a&gt;” as a widely accepted mnemonic device detailing the signs of stroke. And as the acronym suggests, these symptoms come on quickly, Giglio said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what it means:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;alance — changes in balance or a loss of balance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;yesight — changes in vision, like blurriness, loss of sight, or double vision.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;acial droop — drooping of the face or an uneven smile.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;rm — arm weakness on one side of the body.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;peech — changes in speech, like slurring words or speaking gibberish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;ime — it’s time to call emergency services. According to Willey, the “t” can also stand for the terrible headache that comes on fast.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You could have all of those symptoms, you could have one of those symptoms or any mixture in between,” Giglio said. So, don’t wait around for more than one sign. If you notice any of these issues, go to the emergency room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Best Ways To Optimize Your Digestion As You Get Older&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of this is understandably frustrating and concerning. But experts stress there are ways to minimize any effects from age-related stomach issues. They recommend:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chewing Better&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Better digestion begins in the mouth. “Salivary enzymes help digest starch and fat in the mouth, decreasing the GI tract’s workload,” Mutha said. “The alkaline pH of saliva also helps neutralize acid in the esophagus due to reflux and alleviate GERD symptoms.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bonus: Cutting your food into smaller pieces and chewing at least 15 to 20 times per bite can help mitigate any complications associated with trouble swallowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stimulating Saliva Production&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saliva production tends to decrease as we age, which can affect chewing and swallowing, Sohi said. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.ada.org/en/resources/research/science-and-research-institute/oral-health-topics/xerostomia" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929636" data-affiliate="true"&gt;American Dental Association&lt;/a&gt;, dry mouth is twice as likely to strike when you take one or more medications daily, compared with people with no medications on their roster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things like regularly using an over-the-counter saliva substitute or sipping water between bites can be helpful if dry mouth is a problem for you at mealtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eating More Food That’s Plant-Based, Less That’s Processed &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to optimize digestion is to eat a diet as low in processed foods and high in plant-based diversity as possible. “Diets high in processed food can alter the gut microbiome, leading to dysbiosis,” Sohi said, an unhealthy balance of gut bacteria that’s associated with higher rates of digestive disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides keeping your gut microbiome on the rails, going plant-based is the best way to increase your fiber intake, which is crucial to the quality and consistency of your number two sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiber — soluble and insoluble — is what bulks up your poop, Mutha explained. This not only makes your time on the throne more pleasant and efficient, but it also decreases the likelihood of fecal incontinence and even helps treat diarrhea by absorbing water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staying Hydrated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydration is crucial to avoid constipation, Mutha said, especially once you start upping your fiber intake. The &lt;a href="https://www.ncoa.org/article/how-to-stay-hydrated-for-better-health" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929636" data-affiliate="true"&gt;National Council on Aging&lt;/a&gt; recommends drinking one-third of your weight in fluid ounces daily. That means if you weigh 150 pounds, then you should be drinking 50 ounces (or 6¼ cups) of water per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moving More&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Exercise stimulates the motility of the GI tract, so this can be very helpful for digestion,” Sohi said. “Lying recumbent on the couch after eating is one of the worst things you can do because not only does it not help with GI tract motility, but it can also promote acid reflux.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mutha agrees and recommends walking for roughly 15 minutes after your meals to help activate your stomach and improve gastric emptying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting Enough Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is a healing mechanism for the body, so not getting enough quality shut-eye — the recommendation is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sleep/about_sleep/how_much_sleep.html" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929636" data-affiliate="true"&gt;seven to nine hours per night&lt;/a&gt; — can adversely affect your gut barrier and immunity, Mutha said. Researchers are still nailing down the exact mechanisms behind how, but one theory is that &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4849511/" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929636" data-affiliate="true"&gt;sleep deprivation&lt;/a&gt; leads to an increase in microscopic inflammation in the bowel that may domino into gastrointestinal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mastering Your Medications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Any and every medicine has GI side effects — even the ones that are prescribed for GI illnesses,” Mutha said. “Making sure you take your medications exactly as prescribed decreases the risk of side effects.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NSAIDs should never be consumed on an empty stomach, for instance, while acid-suppressive medicines should be taken 30 minutes before breakfast. But if side effects happen anyway, let your doctor know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When To Check In With Your Doctor About Your Digestive Issues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you’re confident the digestive drama you’re experiencing is aging-related or a sign your lifestyle needs a revamp, “it’s important to not assume” and to “share your symptoms with your doctor anyway, as sometimes there can be a more serious underlying cause,” said &lt;a href="https://www.templehealth.org/doctors/neena-mohan" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929636" data-affiliate="true"&gt;Dr. Neena Mohan&lt;/a&gt;, gastroenterologist and assistant professor of clinical medicine at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If, in addition to persistent changes in bowel habits, you’re also experiencing trouble swallowing, abdominal pain, nausea and/or vomiting, unexplained weight loss or have noticed blood in your poop (or it looks black and tarry), it’s time for a consultation with a gastroenterologist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Depending on the issue, your doctor may start with bloodwork and prescribe medications or do further testing, such as an endoscopy or colonoscopy,” Attalla said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/stomach-pain-increase-age_l_650c3421e4b0e83cc0da8dcf" target="_blank" data-skimlinks-tracking="7929636"&gt;HuffPost&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But few are more of a bummer than the way our digestive system seems to lose interest in, well, digesting things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Intestinal issues can arise at any age and can become more prevalent as we age,” &lt;a href="https://providers.inspirahealthnetwork.org/provider/Sara+Attalla/1999340" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Sara Attalla;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Sara Attalla&lt;/a&gt;, a gastroenterologist at Inspira Health in &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/carolinekee/what-is-adenovirus" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:New Jersey;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;New Jersey&lt;/a&gt;, told HuffPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Roughly &lt;a href="https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-statistics/digestive-diseases" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:60 million to 70 million Americans;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;60 million to 70 million Americans&lt;/a&gt; are affected by digestive diseases, according to the National Institutes of Health. Some of the most common symptoms? Heartburn, bloating, abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits (as in constipation, diarrhea or even a combo of the two).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Nailing down what’s causing your digestive drama can be tricky since it’s a multi-faceted problem that typically stems from a highly individual combination of aging and lifestyle-related culprits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How The Aging Process Can Affect Digestion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As we age, the nerves and muscles in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract can start to glitch, resulting in changes to how our digestive organs function individually and work together — usually, this translates into the digestion process itself becoming sluggish and communication signals between digestive organs getting haphazard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Movement within the esophagus and muscles involved in swallowing may not be as effective or coordinated, for instance, and can lead to higher rates of esophageal reflux (known as GERD, where your stomach contents start to make a comeback), while slower motility in the stomach can cause what you’ve eaten to linger and trigger indigestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“The stomach lining can also become thinner with age, which renders you more susceptible to injury in the stomach from things like inflammation,” Attalla said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Decreased &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/24411-prostaglandins" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:prostaglandin production;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;prostaglandin production&lt;/a&gt; over time (a hormone-like substance that plays a role in stomach acid secretion and GI muscle functioning) means a decrease in the protective lining of the stomach, too, leaving you more prone to gastritis and ulcers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The next stop on your food’s digestive journey is a pit stop in the small bowel. “Slower motility here can lead to higher rates of bacterial overgrowth, which can cause bloating and diarrhea,” &lt;a href="https://gastrohealthpartners.com/physicians/dr-sunana-sohi-gastroenterologist-louisville-kentucky/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Sunana Sohi;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Sunana Sohi&lt;/a&gt;, a board-certified gastroenterologist at Gastroenterology Health Partners in Louisville, Kentucky, told HuffPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;And if motility screeches to a halt in your colon, get ready for possible bouts of constipation and diverticulosis (a condition where small sacs form and push against weak spots in the wall of your colon, putting you at risk of symptom flareups, such as bleeding and inflammation).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Then there’s the chronic health conditions that tend to stack up as we get older (arthritisis, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases), many of which can cause limitations to the level of movement we can tolerate, further exacerbating gut motility issues. (“If you don’t move, neither does your gut,” &lt;a href="https://www.utphysicians.com/provider/pritesh-mutha/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Dr. Pritesh Mutha;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Dr. Pritesh Mutha&lt;/a&gt;, an associate professor at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth Houston, told HuffPost.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As for the medications we take to manage these conditions (both prescription and over-the-counter, especially NSAID pain relievers such ad aspirin and ibuprofen), they’re known to cause gastro-themed side effects of their own.

      &lt;span class="js-subbuzz__title-text"&gt;It was then that Staci went to her primary care practitioner with her symptoms and suspicions, and got further testing done as she shared in her TikTok. &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tryingnottoforget/video/7525953178119048478" target="_blank"&gt;She also emphasized how she had to really advocate for herself.&lt;/a&gt; "I remember she said, 'Early-onset Alzheimer's is really rare at your age, but let's send you to a neurologist specializing in memory care and have you checked out.'"&lt;/span&gt;
    
  &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After her cognitive scores showed mild cognitive impairment in December of 2024, her doctor ordered MRIs of the brain and spine, an EEG, and more bloodwork. "This was to rule out Multiple Sclerosis, seizures, brain bleeds, tumors, and a bunch of other stuff. All of the diagnostic testing came back normal. I went back for a second neurology visit in February of 2025, and we discussed the possibility of it being ADHD, or my anxiety and depression. So she ordered a neuropsych evaluation," added Staci. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was finally able to get the blood biomarker testing after continuing to advocate and express concern about her grandmother having the disease. When the biomarkers came back high for Alzheimer's, she got the PET scan that showed widespread amyloid plaques in her brain. Luckily, insurance covered the cost of the tests for her.&lt;/p&gt;

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine skeptic, has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/22/health/covid-vaccines-rfk.html" data-link="native" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class=""&gt;delayed authorization of the fall COVID shots&lt;/a&gt; and dismissed the CDC’s vaccine advisory panel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local health officials say the result is confusion and dwindling supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re in an unfortunate limbo, created by an administration that’s uncommitted to vaccines, between the slow shutting down of ’24-’25 vaccine availability and access to the ’25-’26 version,” Willis said. “This is particularly concerning in California as our transmission rates continue to climb.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="pt16 sy16 bb bt b-gray300 mb32"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="uiTextSmall f aic jcc"&gt;Article continues below this ad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-block-type="ad" data-small-id="B300" data-unit="hnp-sfchronicle.com/article_dtc" class="f jcc mnh250px sm:mnh600px ais lg:none"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical organizations are breaking ranks with the administration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics urged vaccination for infants and children, while the &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/08/acog-releases-updated-maternal-immunization-guidance-covid-influenza-rsv" data-link="native" rel="noopener" target="_blank" class=""&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt; advised shots during pregnancy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both recommendations stand in contrast to new federal guidelines that limit eligibility largely to older adults and those with chronic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consequences are already visible.

Doctors say many patients describe a harsher sore throat than before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Is it more dangerous?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, no. The World Health Organization says the overall risk is “low,” and evidence suggests Stratus is not causing more severe illness than earlier strains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Will vaccines still work?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes. Experts say last year’s shots and the pending 2025-26 vaccines should still protect against severe disease, though federal delays may make access harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Do at-home COVID-19 tests detect newer variants?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="r1udwkp5 d1uy5mhj articleBody mb32" data-block-type="text" data-dropcap="false"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, according to infectious disease experts. That’s because the antigen detected by at-home tests “has remained fairly stable even as the virus mutates and new strains of COVID develop,” Harvard Medical School instructor Dr. Michelle Chan &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/covid-tests-do-at-home-tests-work-on-newer-variants" data-link="native" class=""&gt;said on the university’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn top"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="y1px x100 abs bgn bottom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>San Francisco Chronicle</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 20:14:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMikgFBVV95cUxQd1pjcDNZQUEyRW9QMDhCVENPT2h1T1M5bzZ3UG5USjZNeXY3LWNJRFRCNlktNFVNb2VwcWlnMXhEVlAtcmRLSzd5cnpiLURxOHpZSWtWU0prSW5FLU43a1J0THZ4QW1nOWVGXzNfdEFqMEJ1U0lmdVJ4UzVpWTdRQnhsX3pYMl9EZ0xKdXROZlZrdw</guid></item><item><title>心脏病专家说，心脏病患者应该接种包括新冠肺炎在内的呼吸道疾病疫苗- PBS</title><link>https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/heart-disease-patients-should-get-vaccinated-against-respiratory-illnesses-including-covid-19-cardiology-experts-say</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body-text"&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;The American College of Cardiology issued new guidance Tuesday that recommends adults with heart disease get vaccinated against respiratory illnesses, including RSV, COVID-19, pneumococcal infection, shingles and influenza. Just weeks out from cold and flu season, the &lt;a href="https://www.acc.org/Latest-in-Cardiology/Journal-Scans/2025/08/26/11/44/New-ACC-CCG-Consolidates-Recommendations-on-Immunization"&gt;recommendation&lt;/a&gt; marks a departure from official U.S. guidance as the Trump administration makes moves to limit vaccine access, particularly for COVID-19 shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People living with heart disease are already considered a high-risk group, “no matter what their age,” said Dr. William Schaffner, a spokesperson for the college and a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. He said vaccine-preventable infections can be more serious in people who have underlying chronic heart disease and can disrupt their care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It can cause more heart failure, and some of these infections predispose actually to heart attacks,” Schaffner said. “Of course, those are things every cardiologist would like to prevent on behalf of their patients.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/who-is-eligible-for-a-covid-shot-what-to-know-about-the-fdas-latest-changes"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;READ MORE:&lt;/strong&gt; Who is eligible for a COVID shot? What to know about the latest U.S. changes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cardiologists are urged to either vaccinate their patients themselves or to make a strong recommendation for patients to get vaccinated, the new guidelines said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination rates for infectious diseases like COVID have declined in recent years. In a KFF poll published Aug. 1, &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/health-information-trust/poll-while-most-adults-do-not-expect-to-get-a-covid-19-shot-this-fall-those-who-want-one-worry-about-access-and-insurance-coverage/"&gt;6 in 10 U.S. adults said they were not likely to get the updated COVID vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, a steep decline since the pandemic began five years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medical societies like the ACC, the &lt;a href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/05/acog-statement-on-hhs-recommendations-regarding-the-covid-vaccine-during-pregnancy"&gt;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/32836"&gt;American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt; have historically recommended vaccines to protect people against seasonal viruses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this season’s emerging set of guidelines stand out because they contradict statements from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who founded Children’s Health Defense, an organization that promotes vaccine skepticism. Kennedy has ratcheted up restrictions to vaccine access since the Senate confirmed him in February,including cutting off funding for all mRNA vaccine research and ending national recommendations that &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/cdc-removes-language-that-says-healthy-kids-and-pregnant-women-should-get-covid-shots"&gt;pregnant people and children get vaccinated against COVID&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To counter these claims, ACOG and the AAP have each offered their own evidence-based recommendations that pregnant people and children should get vaccinated against COVID to prevent the risk of severe outcomes, including hospitalization and death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of how the discourse around vaccination shifts, vaccine recommendations are likely to continue moving forward, said Dr. Eduardo Sanchez, the chief medical officer for prevention at the American Heart Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanchez said he hoped that hearing another recommendation for getting vaccinated from “yet another credible science-based source of information would add that to the reasons why [people] should trust vaccines and expect that they’re going to benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy has also taken steps to control, if not silence, those who have traditionally advised the government on vaccine policies and best practices. On June 9, &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/rfk-jr-ousts-entire-17-person-cdc-vaccine-advisory-committee"&gt;he fired all members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices&lt;/a&gt; at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, replacing them with several vaccine skeptics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re not following the body of science at all,” said Dr. Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist who also directs the Vaccine Integrity Project. Osterholm cautioned that myths and disinformation are “likely to confuse parents and consumers of vaccines.” &lt;/p&gt;

For one thing, women's health has only been taken seriously by the medical establishment for the past few decades; the &lt;a href="https://orwh.od.nih.gov/toolkit/recruitment/history" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;FDA wasn't even required&lt;/a&gt; to include women in clinical trials until 1993.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, there are some indications that medical reticence may be hurting men in sweeping ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/01.CIR.98.21.2334" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;landmark study&lt;/a&gt; conducted by the American Heart Association in the late 1990s, men made up 75 percent of all sudden cardiac deaths, with men aged 45 to 75 particularly likely to die due to coronary artery disease. With symptoms like chest pain and shortness of breath as &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;early warning signs&lt;/a&gt;, coronary artery disease can easily be treated if it's caught early enough — but men have to convince themselves to go to the doctor first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though heart disease remains the leading cause of death &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;among men globally&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11642101/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, prostate cancer is another major killer that could be treated effectively by regular screenings. The &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/prostate-cancer/about/key-statistics.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;American Cancer Society estimates&lt;/a&gt; that in the US, one in eight men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetimes — and that one in 44 men will ultimately die from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Eric Wallen, the chair of urology at Medical University of South Carolina, a lot of men erroneously believe they don't need to get prostate exams, which are indeed uncomfortable, but &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/rrrtrh/are_prostate_exams_any_worse_than_pap_smears/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;probably not much more so&lt;/a&gt; than a pap smear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think a lot of people are falling back on, 'Well, that’s not really recommended,'" Wallen told the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; his patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(According to the University of California at Los Angeles' Health system, those screenings &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/no-early-warning-signs-its-important-to-keep-up-with-prostate-cancer-screenings" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;very much &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; for all men between the ages of 50 and 55, or at age 45 if they have a family member with prostate cancer. Any man who has to get up frequently in the night to urinate, often an &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/15533-frequent-urination" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;early warning sign&lt;/a&gt; of prostate trouble, should also get checked out.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Changes to the way men get healthcare after COVID — which &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971224002388" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;killed men far more often&lt;/a&gt; than women, &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Global-mortality-and-sexual-disparity-of-COVID-19-by-continents-A-Global-COVID-19_fig1_347514994" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; — may also have to do with their increasing health disparities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I used to joke and say Viagra was the best thing to ever happen to the men’s health movement," Mike Leventhal of the Tennessee chapter of the Men's Health Network advocacy organization told the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;, "because at the time, you had to look a doctor in the eye and tell him about why you’re there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, men can discreetly get their erectile dysfunction (ED) medication from telehealth services like Ro or Hims without having to go through the screenings previously required to obtain those medications, which are known to &lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/hypertension-high-blood-pressure/erectile-dysfunction-treatments" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;induce a drop in blood pressure&lt;/a&gt; that may be dangerous for men with certain preexisting conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking to the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;, Johns Hopkins urology professor Arthur Burnett said the telehealth trend is also worrisome because ED can also be an &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/erectile-dysfunction/in-depth/erectile-dysfunction/art-20045141" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;early sign of heart disease&lt;/a&gt; — one that would not be caught by a virtual prescriber going through dozens of requests for prescriptions each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These services allow people to just quickly make requests that don’t necessarily allow a proper health work-up and may miss diagnoses," Burnett warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on male health: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/donald-trump-hand-spot-health" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;As Health Questions Swirl, Weird Spot Appears on Trump’s Hand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 19:06:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTFBLUU1zaTlQUl9SVXN1eFpvUUl0MHZidGw0SUI0WjJ3eVdHVmFCbGs0LURUX3BaNjVhclI2YWlvUG9Od0xwNVl1VEtMQi1qTnFqZVlqZjBJT0oyWWU2SjZsMU52b2lDeHVEREkxMkhsbVc</guid></item><item><title>眼科检查可以在症状出现前几十年发现阿尔茨海默氏症-神经科学新闻</title><link>https://neurosciencenews.com/alzheimers-eye-exam-29619/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Eye exams could help detect Alzheimer’s disease years before symptoms arise. By studying mice with a common genetic mutation, researchers found abnormal changes in retinal blood vessels that paralleled brain changes linked to dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the retina functions as an accessible extension of the brain, these findings highlight its potential as a powerful biomarker. The research paves the way for routine eye exams to aid in early diagnosis and intervention for Alzheimer’s and related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retina as Brain Window:&lt;/strong&gt; The retina shares tissue with the brain, making it a reliable site to track neurological health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genetic Risk Factor:&lt;/strong&gt; Mice with the MTHFR677C&amp;gt;T mutation showed early retinal vessel abnormalities tied to dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Routine eye exams could one day detect Alzheimer’s risk 20 years before symptoms appear.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Jackson Laboratory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Within the next few years, doctors may be able to spot signs of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias using routine eye exams well before symptoms appear, a new study suggests.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research, recently published in &lt;em&gt;Alzheimer’s &amp;amp; Dementia&lt;/em&gt;, links abnormal changes in the tiny blood vessels of the retinas of mice with a common genetic mutation known to increase Alzheimer’s disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-112450"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows an eye." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/08/eye-exam-Alzheimers-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Even though more studies are needed to gain a deeper understanding of how vascular health in the retina affects the risk of dementia, the new insights have important implications for people with this genetic factor, Reagan said. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings build on previous work from the same group at The Jackson Laboratory (JAX), which found similar vascular changes in mice’s brains and linked abnormalities in specific retinal cells to early dementia risk, strengthening the case that the retina is a powerful biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you’re at an optometrist or ophthalmologist appointment, and they can see odd vascular changes in your retina, that could potentially represent something that is also happening in your brain, which could be very informative for early diagnostics,” said Alaina Reagan, a neuroscientist at The Jackson Laboratory (JAX) who led the work with Gareth Howell, professor and Diana Davis Spencer Foundation Chair for Glaucoma Research at JAX who spearheaded the previous study.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the retina is part of the central nervous system, scientists often see it as an extension of the brain that shares essentially the same tissue. That’s why changes in retinal blood vessels can offer early clues about brain health and diseases like Alzheimer’s, Reagan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Your retina is essentially your brain, but it’s much more accessible because your pupil is just a hole, and we can see tons of stuff,” Reagan explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All the cells are very similar, all the neurons are quite similar, all the immune cells are quite similar, and they behave similarly under pressure if you’ve got a disease.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team studied mice with a mutation called MTHFR&lt;sup&gt;677C&amp;gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;, which is found in up to 40% of people. They found that the mice’s retinas had twisted vessels, narrowed and swollen arteries, and less vessel branching as early as six months of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This reflects similar changes in the brain linked to poor blood flow and increased risk of cognitive decline. Vessels that appear more twisted and looped than normal can signal problems with hypertension, as the narrowing tissue limits nutrient and oxygen transport, Reagan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can see these wavy vessels in the retinas, which can occur in people with dementia,” Reagan said. “That speaks to a more systemic problem, not just a brain- or retina-specific problem. It could be a blood pressure problem affecting everything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2022, a study by the same group revealed similar vascular changes in the brains of mice with the same MTHFR&lt;sup&gt;677C&amp;gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; mutation, highlighting the link between vascular health in the retina that resembles human disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These mice have fewer vessels in their cortex and reduced blood flow to their brains,” Reagan said. “These changes are subtle, but they are there.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also discovered changes in protein patterns in both the brain and retina. They found disruptions in how cells produce energy, remove damaged proteins, and maintain the structure and support of blood vessels, offering important clues about how the MTHFR&lt;sup&gt;677C&amp;gt;T &lt;/sup&gt;mutation affects the eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results also support a growing theory that blood vessel health plays a central role in neurodegenerative diseases, Reagan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lot of these molecular changes are happening in conjunction, which suggests these systems in brain and retinal tissue are working in tandem,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though more studies are needed to gain a deeper understanding of how vascular health in the retina affects the risk of dementia, the new insights have important implications for people with this genetic factor, Reagan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the study also captured the influence of sex and age, with female mice showing worse outcomes. By 12 months, they showed reduced vessel density and branching, highlighting progressive vascular changes. Similarly, women develop dementia more often than men, according to the World Health Organization.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see if the link between the mutation and vascular changes occurs in humans, as well as whether the new insight could be used in eye exams, the team is partnering with clinicians and dementia care specialists at Northern Light Acadia Hospital in Bangor, Maine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea is to study not just one cause or solution for Alzheimer’s and other dementias, as these conditions depend on many different genetic and environmental factors, but to learn more about how eye health adds to overall risk for these diseases. If the clinicians know which signs to look for, they could communicate those risk factors to patients and recommend further tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people over 50 have some kind of vision impairment and get checked annually for prescription changes,” Reagan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Are they more at risk if they have these vascular changes, and is that a point when doctors could start mitigating brain changes? That could be 20 years before cognitive damage becomes noticeable to patients and their families.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other authors are Michael MacLean, Travis L. Cossette, and Gareth R.

We examine retinal vascular health in a mouse containing the ADRD risk variant &lt;em&gt;Mthfr&lt;sup&gt;677C&amp;gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to determine if changes in retina mirror similar changes in cerebrovasculature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70501-sec-0020-title"&gt;METHODS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morphology and function of retinal vasculature and neurons were assessed using in vivo imaging, immunohistochemistry, and pattern electroretinography. RNAscope and proteomics were employed to determine &lt;em&gt;Mthfr&lt;/em&gt; gene expression and differential protein expression in mice carrying &lt;em&gt;Mthfr&lt;sup&gt;677C&amp;gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70501-sec-0030-title"&gt;RESULTS&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mice show age- and sex-dependent retinal vascular deficits, displaying similarities to previously published brain data. &lt;em&gt;Mthfr&lt;/em&gt; is widely expressed and co-localizes with vascular cell markers. Proteomics identified common molecular signatures across the brain and retina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="alz70501-sec-0040-title"&gt;DISCUSSION&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results demonstrate that &lt;em&gt;Mthfr&lt;/em&gt;-dependent vascular phenotypes occur in brain and retina similarly. These data suggest that assessing age and genetic-driven changes within retinal vasculature represents a minimally invasive method to predict AD-related cerebrovascular damage.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 17:15:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE5oTnBmdjdaRzhMOGhTeVJLSUNXSlZ4TFZLbURPY0FEcVQxcWRaRUpEdzlfakhNcWVJZDRSLUhEUHQ2R0pyTmx0b29BSTJwMEhoMHo5bVgyaU1zNFhSSjBFclNFWF9uQQ</guid></item><item><title>MDH确认今年有20例西尼罗河病毒病例，明尼苏达州有2例死亡- Bring Me The News</title><link>https://bringmethenews.com/minnesota-news/mdh-confirms-20-west-nile-virus-cases-2-deaths-in-minnesota-this-year</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;&lt;p id="cmsg"&gt;Please enable JS and disable any ad blocker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Bring Me The News</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 17:14:53 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisAFBVV95cUxNY2pfVjJzVVVfbktTT3c5ZDFhUmJvc3lRa1ZQUlZqSW5DbnlLVlZxRzdfZnZ3c0dnSGlHUVZKY095eEV3LXZtY05FaGdTQVBUa1ZEaDZUUWlsdUhMc3RfZTUtZzJYbzJEYzNWVVZ1X3MyMGdrc1FPMF83RU8zSXYyVFlPWGZtYkxzOUk4bDJhblpWMW40QjkzbEFFRENabU1KNFVyMW5ES0NpY3NFT0REVQ</guid></item><item><title>新墨西哥州男子在今年该州首例人类病例中被诊断出患有鼠疫：官员- ABC新闻</title><link>https://abcnews.go.com/Health/new-mexico-man-diagnosed-plague-states-1st-human/story?id=124984885</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="xvlfx ZRifP TKoO eaKKC EcdEg bOdfO qXhdi NFNeu UyHES " data-testid="prism-article-body"&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao MvWXB TjIXL aGjvy ebVHC "&gt;A New Mexico man has been diagnosed with plague, marking the state's first human case this year, according to &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.nmhealth.org/news/awareness/2025/8/?view=2265" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;local health officials&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The patient, a 43-year-old man from Valencia County -- located just southwest of Albuquerque -- was hospitalized with the condition but has since been discharged, the New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Recently, the patient had been camping in Rio Arriba County, which borders Colorado, where health officials believe he may have been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;No other identifying information about the man was available, including his name or race/ethnicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Many people think of this as a disease of the past, but in fact, it circulates in wildlife throughout the western U.S.," Dr. Erin Phipps, state public health veterinarian for NMDOH, told ABC News.

"If a person has the bubonic form of plague -- plague with that inflamed lymph node -- that can point a clinician in the correct direction pretty quickly. However, if somebody has a septicemic or pneumonic plague without the enlarged lymph nodes, that initial presentation can resemble many other diseases, and that's one of the challenges that we see in terms of getting someone on the appropriate treatment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"It's critical for someone to be treated promptly, because plague can be fatal very quickly," Phipps added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Plague is treatable with commonly available antibiotics and the chances of full recovery are higher if a patient seeks medical care early, the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/plague/diagnosis-testing/index.html#cdc_testing_what_next-treatment" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;CDC says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;To reduce the risk of plague, the NMDOH recommends avoiding sick or dead rodents and rabbits; cleaning up areas near the home where rodents could live; using insect repellent when outdoors; and keeping hay and wood as far away from the house as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Additionally, the NMDOH recommends having a sick pet examined immediately by a veterinarian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Although this is the first human case of plague recorded in New Mexico this year, it is not the first in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;Last week, a &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/california-resident-tests-positive-plague/story?id=124814023" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;California resident tested positive for plague&lt;/a&gt; after likely being bitten by an infected flea while camping, according to local health officials in the state.

							&lt;p data-start="310" data-end="438"&gt;Staying mentally sharp isn’t just luck—it’s the byproduct of dozens of small choices that build on each other year after year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="440" data-end="771"&gt;I’ve met people in their 80s who can still debate politics with more clarity than people half their age, who remember old lyrics and recent headlines with equal sharpness, and who learn new apps faster than their grandkids. These aren’t outliers. They’ve cultivated habits that quietly protect their minds from dulling with time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="773" data-end="917"&gt;The good news is that these habits aren’t exclusive to them. They’re accessible to anyone, and the earlier you start, the stronger the payoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="919" data-end="977"&gt;Here are nine of those habits worth paying attention to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="984" data-end="1021"&gt;1. They keep learning new things&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1023" data-end="1088"&gt;Sharp older adults have one thing in common: they stay curious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1090" data-end="1325"&gt;It doesn’t always mean going back to school. Sometimes it’s taking up watercolor painting, learning the basics of coding, or diving into podcasts on topics they know nothing about. The point is—they never stop being students of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1327" data-end="1538"&gt;As neuroscientist Dr. Michael Merzenich has said, “The brain is like a muscle. If you don’t give it a workout, it will weaken.” That workout doesn’t come from passive consumption—it comes from active learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1540" data-end="1919"&gt;When I was traveling through Portugal, I stayed with a couple in their 70s who had just started studying astronomy. Every evening, they’d set up a telescope and try to identify constellations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1540" data-end="1919"&gt;They weren’t doing it for recognition or to “stay young.” They were simply curious. And that curiosity made their conversations lively, their memory sharp, and their thinking flexible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="1921" data-end="2006"&gt;The key takeaway? Never stop learning—even if you’re the oldest person in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2013" data-end="2059"&gt;2. They challenge their memory on purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2061" data-end="2178"&gt;The brain thrives on friction. Sharp-minded seniors understand this, so they give their memory deliberate exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2180" data-end="2467"&gt;Crosswords, Sudoku, memory games, even something as basic as recalling a shopping list without writing it down—all these small challenges add up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2180" data-end="2467"&gt;Researchers emphasize that &lt;a href="https://www.sherringford.org/post/boost-your-brainpower-the-science-of-active-recall-retrieval-practice?.com"&gt;active recall&lt;/a&gt;—retrieving information from memory—fortifies neural pathways far more effectively than passive review. This phenomenon, known as the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect?.com"&gt;testing effect&lt;/a&gt;, is well-supported by decades of cognitive research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2469" data-end="2706"&gt;A friend of mine has a quirky daily ritual: he memorizes three phone numbers every morning, just to see if he can recall them by evening. Sounds trivial, right? But those small sparks of effort build resilience into his memory network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2708" data-end="2940"&gt;And here’s the secret—memory exercises don’t have to be boring. They can come through song lyrics, trivia nights, or even trying to remember recipes without checking the book. The point isn’t perfection—it’s the act of stretching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="2947" data-end="2986"&gt;3. They nurture strong social ties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="2988" data-end="3190"&gt;Loneliness is one of the most dangerous threats to mental health. Not just emotionally—but cognitively. Multiple studies link isolation with faster cognitive decline and even higher risks of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3192" data-end="3394"&gt;The people who stay sharp into their 80s are usually the ones who make time for connection. They grab coffee with friends, join local walking groups, or volunteer where conversation naturally happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3396" data-end="3801"&gt;I once met a retired teacher in San Francisco who told me, “I don’t miss the job. I miss the staffroom debates.” To fill that gap, he started a weekly discussion group at his library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3396" data-end="3801"&gt;Every Thursday, ten or so people show up to talk about current events, books, and sometimes even conspiracy theories. He laughed when he said, “The best part is, I have to stay on my toes. Someone always challenges me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3803" data-end="3884"&gt;That mental engagement—listening, arguing, adapting—acts as fuel for his brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="3891" data-end="3921"&gt;4. They move their bodies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="3923" data-end="4210"&gt;It’s impossible to separate brain health from body health. Exercise increases blood flow to the brain, improves mood, and supports memory. You don’t have to run marathons or deadlift huge weights to see the benefits. Even brisk walking, swimming, or yoga makes a measurable difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4212" data-end="4364"&gt;As noted in a landmark randomized controlled trial published in &lt;em data-start="64" data-end="70"&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, one year of &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1015950108?.com"&gt;moderate aerobic exercise&lt;/a&gt; increased the volume of the anterior hippocampus by around 2%, effectively reversing age-related loss by about 1–2 years—and significantly improved spatial memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4366" data-end="4576"&gt;I’ve noticed it myself. If I fall out of my exercise routine, I get sluggish not just physically but mentally. Concentration feels harder. Ideas don’t flow as easily. Movement is brain fuel, plain and simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4578" data-end="4863"&gt;And some older adults make it fun. A woman I met in her 70s in Mexico City had joined a salsa dancing group. She admitted she wasn’t very good, but the combination of music, movement, and socializing lit her up. She said it made her feel “10 years younger.” Honestly, I believed her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="4870" data-end="4924"&gt;5. They embrace technology instead of avoiding it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="4926" data-end="5124"&gt;Sharp older adults don’t hide from technology. They may not love every new gadget, but they lean in. Whether it’s texting, video calls, or exploring online forums, they adapt instead of resisting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5126" data-end="5405"&gt;I once helped my uncle set up a music streaming app. At first, he said, “This is too complicated.” But once he got the hang of it, he started curating playlists of his favorite 70s records and texting them to me. A month later, he was recommending bands I hadn’t even heard of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5407" data-end="5654"&gt;This openness doesn’t just keep older adults socially connected. It keeps their brains flexible. Psychologists call this &lt;a href="https://psychology.tips/cognitive-flexibility/?.com"&gt;“cognitive flexibility”&lt;/a&gt;—the ability to switch between tasks and perspectives. And it’s a huge predictor of mental sharpness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5656" data-end="5767"&gt;So while some shrug off new tech as unnecessary, the people who thrive embrace it as another chance to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="5774" data-end="5807"&gt;6. They practice mindfulness&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5809" data-end="5904"&gt;Mindfulness has gone from a trendy buzzword to a scientifically backed tool for brain health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="5906" data-end="6230"&gt;Meditation, mindful breathing, or simply slowing down to notice details in daily life helps reduce stress, sharpen attention, and improve memory. As Dr. Richard Davidson, founder of the Center for Healthy Minds, explains: “Attention is the building block of learning. If we strengthen attention, everything else improves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6232" data-end="6469"&gt;Not every sharp older adult sits cross-legged chanting “om.” Some simply build small mindfulness rituals: writing down three things they’re grateful for, gardening slowly and attentively, or pausing for a few deep breaths before meals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6471" data-end="6574"&gt;What matters is training the mind to focus. In a world of constant distraction, that ability is gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="6581" data-end="6607"&gt;7. They stay creative&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6609" data-end="6802"&gt;Creativity keeps the brain elastic. When you create—whether through painting, writing, carpentry, or playing music—you activate neural pathways that strengthen problem-solving and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="6804" data-end="7040"&gt;When I visited Japan, I met an 80-something woman who wrote a haiku every morning. She didn’t call herself a poet. She just said, “It keeps my thoughts sharp.” And it showed—her mind was lively, her humor quick, her presence magnetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7042" data-end="7316"&gt;This is a pattern I’ve seen over and over again. The act of creating—not the quality of the output—is what matters. You don’t have to be Picasso. Doodling, journaling, even building a birdhouse counts. Creativity is less about talent and more about staying mentally agile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="7323" data-end="7357"&gt;8. They prioritize good sleep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7359" data-end="7430"&gt;Here’s a subtle truth: sharp older adults guard their sleep routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7432" data-end="7630"&gt;Sleep isn’t wasted time. It’s when the brain consolidates memories and clears out toxins that build up during the day. Poor sleep is linked to worse focus, weaker memory, and higher dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7632" data-end="7830"&gt;The sharpest people I know in their 70s and 80s take sleep seriously. They keep regular schedules, avoid late caffeine, and often have wind-down rituals like reading or listening to calming music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="7832" data-end="8019"&gt;One man told me he uses a simple rule: no screens after 9 p.m. “If I don’t see the news cycle,” he said, “my brain actually rests.” He swore it was his secret to waking up with clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8026" data-end="8078"&gt;9. They stay curious about people and the world&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8080" data-end="8128"&gt;This might be the most important habit of all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8130" data-end="8341"&gt;The people who stay sharp don’t shrink their world down to nostalgia or routine. They keep asking questions. They talk to younger people. They pay attention to culture, politics, technology, and human stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8343" data-end="8529"&gt;Curiosity fuels growth. Eleanor Roosevelt once said, “At a child’s birth, if a mother could ask a fairy godmother to endow it with the most useful gift, that gift should be curiosity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8531" data-end="8753"&gt;Sharp older adults never stop exercising that gift. They don’t just tell stories from the past—they want to know what’s happening now, and what’s coming next. That openness keeps them alert, engaged, and mentally strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 data-start="8760" data-end="8780"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8782" data-end="8909"&gt;Mental sharpness into old age isn’t an accident. It’s the result of deliberate choices—small habits that add up over decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="8911" data-end="9055"&gt;From learning new things and challenging their memory, to moving their bodies and staying curious, these practices are available to all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9057" data-end="9271"&gt;The earlier you adopt them, the more they pay off. But it’s never too late to start. Even small changes—like memorizing a grocery list, joining a dance class, or cutting off screens before bed—can ripple forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p data-start="9273" data-end="9342"&gt;The question is: which of these habits can you put into play today?&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;An illuminating video has captured in alarming detail exactly what happens to the body after catching the plague. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The medieval illness—one of the most deadly in history—ravaged Europe between 1347 and 1351 and killed tens of millions of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Cases of the condition, dubbed the black death, today are rare, with modern antibiotics drastically reducing deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But officials were alarmed last week after an unidentified adult in the US tested positive for the plague and was recovering at home after receiving medical care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It is believed an infected flea bit the patient, who was camping in the South Lake Tahoe area. No other information on their condition was released. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now, the minute-long &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BH8y7Pmq-g"&gt;YouTube video published&lt;/a&gt; by Zack D. Films—who boasts 23 million subscribers—has shown how the bacterial infection passes through the body and affects different limbs, without any treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If you got bitten by a flea, a bacterium would enter your body and begin to multiply quickly,' it said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'They would head to your lymph nodes, causing them to swell up and forming painful bumps in your armpits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The video simulation shows in gruesome detail what happens to the body once it is infected&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A person living near Lake Tahoe (pictured) tested positive for the plague (file photo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Plague is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which is carried by fleas and transmitted between animals. The picture above is a 3D illustration of the bacterium&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The bacteria can also get into your bloodstream, causing bleeding under your skin. This bleeding makes your skin turn dark and black in certain spots.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The simulation then shows the person's finger tips becoming black before spreading slowly across the limbs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Left untreated, the infection can ravage enters the bloodstream and travels to the lungs, causing deadly infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Once the disease enters cells, it kills them by releasing deadly toxins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Reacting to the video, users expressed their shock at how quickly the infection spreads.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This is why I'm grateful to have been born in this era. Where medicine and science are advanced enough to handle situations like this,' one wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) figures show there have been no cases of the plague found in the UK since 1918.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The risk of an infected person returning to Britain from abroad is low, the agency says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Plague is caused by infection with the bacterium Yersinia pestis, usually found in small mammals and their fleas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It still occurs in several countries in Africa, Asia, South America and the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last month, the US &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14898079/US-state-rocked-sudden-death-medieval-disease-officials-warn-come.html"&gt;recorded their first plague death&lt;/a&gt; since 2007, in Arizona.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are three forms of the plague: bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But the most common is the bubonic plague, named after 'buboes', the painful swollen bumps the infection causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms that develop one to seven days after infection include a sudden onset of fever, chills, head and body aches, fatigue, weakness, vomiting and nausea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;As annoying as catching a cold may be, there could be a silver lining. New research suggests that it may temporarily protect you from getting covid-19.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Researchers revealed that individuals, especially children, who had recently been infected by a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rhinoviruses/about/index.html"&gt;rhinovirus&lt;/a&gt;—the most frequent culprit behind the common cold—were remarkably less likely to get a SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus that causes covid-19, in the following weeks. These results might shed light onto why children have lower chances of developing covid symptoms than adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="not-prose my-8 -mx-4 xs:max-w-xs xs:mx-auto"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;An ‘early advantage’&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Our findings suggest that the immune boost from a recent cold may give the body an early advantage in fighting SARS-CoV-2 before it has a chance to take hold,” Max Seibold, Director of the Regenerative Medicine and Genome Editing Program (REGEN) at National Jewish Health, said in a National Jewish Health &lt;a href="https://www.nationaljewish.org/about-us/news/press-releases/2025-news/common-cold-may-protect-against-covid-19#:~:text=DENVER%20%2D%20A%20new%20study%20led,virus%20that%20causes%20COVID%2D19."&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “This may help explain why children, who tend to get more colds than adults, generally experience fewer and less severe COVID cases.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Seibold and his colleagues detailed their results in a &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiaf374/8230147?login=true"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this month in The Journal of Infectious Diseases, after analyzing data that tracked over 4,100 people in 1,394 households from May 2020 to February 2021. They tested thousands of self-collected nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 and other common respiratory viruses, such as rhinovirus.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Built-in boost&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rhinoviruses trigger &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/interferon"&gt;interferons&lt;/a&gt;—natural agents that fight against infection and diseases—in our airways. This reaction can give the immune system a temporary boost, leaving it better equipped to handle other viruses that show up. In fact, to further investigate how recent viral infections impact the body’s antiviral defenses, the team also studied gene &lt;a href="https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Gene-Expression"&gt;expression&lt;/a&gt; (when genetic information is translated into a function) in people’s airways and found children had a higher baseline expression of genes related to interferons than adults.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Based on these findings, we hypothesize that interferons induced by prior viral respiratory infections may prime the airways of children with high levels of antiviral defense proteins, resulting in reduced levels of SARS-CoV-2 infection and better clinical outcomes compared to adults,” the researchers explained in the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This phenomenon, known as heterologous viral interference, “has been observed for other respiratory viruses, but has yet to be demonstrated for SARS-CoV-2,” the scientists added.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Camille Moore, lead author of the study and a biostatistician at National Jewish Health, explained that “understanding how one virus can affect the body’s response to another could help us develop new prevention strategies, especially for vulnerable populations,” she said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moore also clarifies that this doesn’t mean people should start trying to catch a cold. And if you think that’s an obvious warning, you clearly don’t know humans very well.&lt;/p&gt;

And because its code is so different, it is less likely to mix with natural organisms, easing safety concerns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This breakthrough could also pave the way for new medicines, advanced materials and synthetic lifeforms beyond anything seen in nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;&lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The microbe, named Syn57, is a lab-engineered version of Escherichia coli, a bacterium that can naturally cause infections in the gut, urinary tract and other areas of the body&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;To tackle this huge project, scientists divided the genome into 38 pieces, each about 100,000 DNA letters long. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They built each piece in yeast and then inserted it into E coli using a method called uREXER, which combines CRISPR-Cas9 and other tools to swap in synthetic DNA in one step. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some genome regions slowed growth or resisted changes, but the team solved these issues by adjusting gene sequences, untangling overlapping genes, and carefully choosing which codons to swap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Step by step, the fragments were stitched together into the final, fully synthetic bacterium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The result, Syn57, is the most heavily redesigned organism ever made, demonstrating that life can survive with a much smaller, simpler genetic code. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Wesley Robertson, a synthetic biologist at the Medical Research Council Laboratory in the UK, told the&lt;a class="" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/31/science/dna-genetics-engineering-microbes.html"&gt; New York Times&lt;/a&gt;: 'We definitely went through these periods where we were like, 'Well, will this be a dead end, or can we see this through?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Syn57 is alive, but barely. While normal E. coli can double in an hour, Syn57 takes four, making it 'extremely feeble,' Yonatan Chemla, a synthetic biologist at MIT who was not involved in the study. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The bacteria grew on a jelly-like surface and in a nutritious liquid, but at four times slower than their natural counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Robertson and his team are now experimenting to see if they can make it grow faster. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If successful, scientists could eventually program it to do tasks that ordinary bacteria cannot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In addition to the 20 standard amino acids that all life uses to make proteins, chemists can create hundreds of others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Syn57's seven missing codons could potentially be reassigned to these unnatural amino acids, allowing the bacterium to produce new drugs or other useful molecules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Syn57 could also make engineered microbes safer for the environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Microbes swap genes easily, which can be risky if engineered DNA spreads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a gene from Syn57 would be gibberish to natural bacteria because of its unique genetic code, preventing it from being used outside the lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 15:19:48 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiqwFBVV95cUxPRWpWNG9SZ3pZMHBJalJoZ3lUOHBhMlRCOWs2cTFzQmdTR1BpdjFWMUpkZld1VjlnT2NMQXdlbVJqWmpuUFFyNDdMdFIwSVpFTG56YjBha0NjQlpHTE8wdDc2dWF0eGdrZVktX2RiLXdJR3Z4X0dsV25VamlQWkhmaFMxSnFHR2JHa2lqTGVySl9GaFJQdTdRY3VsWmllb1pVVVRUb2VTZWN1NWM</guid></item><item><title>当你喝丁香水时，你的血糖会发生什么？ - Verywell Health</title><link>https://www.verywellhealth.com/can-cloves-help-lower-blood-sugar-and-inflammation-11795846</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="health-sc-page_1-0" class="comp health-sc-page mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content article-content expert-content right-rail__offset lock-journey" data-sc-sticky-offset="60" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[400, 1400, 1400, 1700, 2000, 2200, 2400, 2600, 2800]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="health-sc-block-callout--key-takeaway_1-0" class="comp health-sc-block-callout--key-takeaway health-sc-block-callout-base mntl-sc-block-callout mntl-block theme-key-takeaway theme-key-takeaway" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block-callout-heading_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-heading mntl-text-block"&gt;Key Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block-callout-body_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block-callout-body mntl-text-block expert-content"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Clove water contains antioxidants, but there’s little evidence it can meaningfully lower blood sugar or inflammation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most clove studies use concentrated extracts, making their real health impact uncertain.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experts say whole foods like leafy greens, berries, and whole grains are far more effective for supporting healthy blood sugar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cloves, a common household spice, have long been used as a home remedy for toothache and other forms of pain. They contain compounds with mild numbing and anti-inflammatory effects, but research offers very limited evidence that cloves are a reliable way to lower blood sugar and inflammation in the body. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-does-clove-water-help-with-blood-sugar-and-inflammation"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Does Clove Water Help With Blood Sugar and Inflammation? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Cloves contain eugenol, a plant compound known for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory qualities. Some early studies suggest that eugenol may help regulate glucose metabolism by lowering glucose levels, improving cholesterol, and protecting the liver and kidneys from damage caused by high blood sugar.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1043661820316236" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, experts are not convinced.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “It's definitely a stretch to say that chewing on a clove or drinking water that cloves had been in would give you the same benefits as some of the components that are in the cloves themselves,” &lt;a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/julie-stefanski" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Julie Stefanski MEd, RDN, LDN,&lt;/a&gt; a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, told Verywell.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although cloves contain antioxidants that help neutralize harmful molecules called free radicals, they’re not necessarily the best option for lowering inflammation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-what-research-actually-shows-about-cloves"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; What Research Actually Shows About Cloves &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most existing research has been conducted on animals or in vitro with high concentrations of cloves, not with clove water or the whole spice.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While one small, preliminary human trial demonstrated a slight drop in blood sugar compared to a placebo, the difference wasn’t enough to be considered clinically significant.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, in another study in 2019, people with and without diabetes who took 250 mg of clove extract daily for 30 days showed &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/naturally-lower-blood-sugar-6830134" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;significantly lower blood glucose levels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Still, given that most studies used concentrated extracts, it’s doubtful that drinking clove water or chewing on cloves will affect blood sugar.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; More research into clove water is necessary to understand the potential health benefits.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-are-there-any-risks-to-eating-cloves"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block health-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Are There Any Risks to Eating Cloves? &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’re a healthy adult, drinking clove water or chewing on cloves is not likely to cause any health problems. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Think of cloves as a flavorful bonus, not a magic fix,” said &lt;a href="https://www.eatrightpro.org/about-us/for-media/meet-our-spokespeople/grace-a-derocha" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Grace Derocha, RDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
At higher concentrations—especially as an oil—cloves can pose serious health risks to the liver and kidneys, increase bleeding, and cause seizures or a coma.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It’s especially toxic for children. The smallest amount could result in seizures and liver damage. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pregnant and breastfeeding people should also be cautious since there isn’t enough data on how cloves or clove oil may affect them. However, the real danger is using clove water or cloves to replace reliable, proper medical care.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Plenty of natural, delicious food choices are packed with benefits that can help reduce inflammation and support healthy blood sugar levels. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Clove water might give you antioxidants and a nice flavor, but the real benefits for blood sugar and inflammation come from whole foods we know are backed by research,” said Derocha.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Some examples of healthy, science-backed choices include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leafy vegetables loaded with fiber: &lt;/strong&gt;Foods like kale and broccoli help slow the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antioxidant-packed berries:&lt;/strong&gt; Berries fight inflammation and support overall metabolic health.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whole grains: &lt;/strong&gt;These provide the fiber needed to steady blood sugar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/foods-with-more-omega-3-than-sardines-11745099" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Omega-3 rich foods&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;Salmon, walnuts, flaxseeds help lower inflammation in the body.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “A Mediterranean-style eating plan, which emphasizes vegetables, fruits, legumes, whole grains, healthy fats, and lean proteins, has the strongest evidence for supporting blood sugar control and lowering inflammation long-term,” added Derocha.&lt;br&gt;

The score is expected to help assess risk for a broader range of potential problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evidence &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/world-first-dementia-linked-to-brain-abnormalities-from-high-blood-pressure"&gt;continues to grow&lt;/a&gt; that high blood pressure puts individuals at an increased risk of cardiovascular and neurological diseases, not to mention &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410"&gt;potential problems&lt;/a&gt; with the kidneys, the eyes, and the body's metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"High blood pressure is the most prevalent and modifiable risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, stroke, dementia, chronic kidney disease, and all-cause mortality," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000249"&gt;explain&lt;/a&gt; the newly issued guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/high-blood-pressure/understanding-blood-pressure-readings"&gt;Blood pressure readings&lt;/a&gt; tell you the pressure of your blood against the walls of your arteries. They come in two parts: the larger number that comes first is systolic blood pressure (the pressure as the heart beats), and the smaller second number is diastolic blood pressure (the pressure between heart beats).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_171851" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171851" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BloodPressure.jpg" alt="Blood pressure guidelines" class="wp-image-171851 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BloodPressure.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BloodPressure-489x415.jpg 489w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/BloodPressure-600x509.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-171851" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Some of the new guidelines.

Stage 1 is classed as 130-139 mm Hg systolic, or 80-89 mm Hg diastolic; anything above that in either figure is stage 2. When you get to above 180 mm Hg systolic or 120 mm Hg diastolic, you need to call your doctor right away, or the emergency services if you've got symptoms like &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cardiac-arrest-and-heart-attacks-arent-the-same-heres-how-to-tell-them-apart"&gt;chest pain&lt;/a&gt; or shortness of breath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you hit &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-simple-daily-habit-could-help-lower-your-blood-pressure"&gt;high blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, the guidelines say, a doctor may need to prescribe medication. In Europe, treatments usually don't begin until the 140/90 mm Hg threshold is reached, unless other health factors are involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The overarching blood pressure treatment goal is &amp;lt;130/80 mm Hg for all adults, with additional considerations for those who require institutional care, have a limited predicted lifespan, or are pregnant," the guidelines &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000249"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lifestyle recommendations are unchanged, and apply to everyone: keep up the exercise, eat a healthy diet relatively low in sodium, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-research-suggests-even-moderate-drinking-is-linked-with-brain-damage"&gt;drink alcohol in moderation&lt;/a&gt; (if at all), and manage your stress levels to reduce blood pressure. Even better, check in with friends and family too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clinicians should collaborate with community leaders, health systems, and practices to implement screening of all adults in their communities and implement guideline-based recommendations regarding prevention and management of high blood pressure to improve rates of blood pressure control," the guidelines &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000249"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines have been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000249"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hypertension&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001356"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Circulation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Not a milk drinker? Not a problem. There are still expert-approved ways to get calcium in your diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's crucial to get enough calcium, because it's essential for bone health. The mineral makes up much of the structure of bones and teeth, according to the &lt;a href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Calcium-HealthProfessional/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/a&gt;. It's also important for muscle function and nerve signaling, registered dietitian nutritionist &lt;a href="https://bebalancednutritionrd.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;Meggie Connelly&lt;/a&gt; told CBS News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For adults, the NIH recommends about 1,000 to 1,200 mg of calcium daily — but, dairy milk isn't the only way to get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other dairy products like yogurt and cheese also contain calcium, as do non-dairy milks fortified with calcium, Connelly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tofu made with calcium is another way to get both the bone-supporting mineral plus protein. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other calcium-fortified options include fruit juices and cereals, the NIH adds. For example, the NIH estimates one cup of orange juice fortified with calcium provides the same amount of calcium (about 27% of your daily value) as 8 ounces of low fat yogurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And one cup of nonfat milk is about the same as an equal serving of calcium-fortified soy milk, according to the institute's estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Qianzhi Jiang, a registered dietitian and owner of &lt;a href="http://www.drnutritionchanger.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;The Nutrition Changer&lt;/a&gt;, said canned fish with bones, like salmon or sardines, also provide calcium. And, you can even get it from some vegetables, Jiang added, like kale, broccoli and bok choy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don't know where you stand with your calcium intake, Connelly said if your plate looks colorful and balanced most of the time (think, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, proteins, dairy or calcium-fortified plant milks), "you're probably in a good place."&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="mpu-flex-inc3" data-ad="mpu-flex-inc" class="ad-mpu-flex-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["mpu-flex-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, some people can still fall short on nutrients like calcium, vitamin D and &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/red-meat-iron-sources-food-experts/" target="_blank" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;iron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; despite balanced meals — "especially for women, those with certain health conditions or plant-based eaters," Connelly added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're worried about your calcium levels, experts suggested consulting your doctor about supplements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Supplements should be viewed as supplemental sources of vitamins and minerals. We should prioritize meeting nutritional goals from natural food sources," Jiang said. "This helps us get the most benefits of all sorts of nutrients while minimizing the risk of overconsumption."&lt;/p&gt;

						&lt;p&gt;You’d assume that a medicine you can buy without a prescription at any pharmacy, big-box retailer, or grocery store is completely safe, right? But as more research comes out, we’re learning that over-the-counter (OTC) drugs can come with a long list of potentially &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/antacids-ppis-migraines/" target="_blank"&gt;dangerous side effects&lt;/a&gt;. The latest such study shows that two very popular and very common pain meds may be fueling antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

  
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/tylenol-dangerous-otc-drug/" target="_blank"&gt;Doctors Warn This Popular Med Is “The Most Dangerous OTC Drug.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s the deal with antibiotic resistance?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests, antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria change and no longer respond to antibiotic medicines, making certain bacterial infections difficult or impossible to treat, as &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" title="Cleveland Clinic: Antibiotic Resistance" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21655-antibiotic-resistance" target="_blank" data-citation="true"&gt;Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; explains. The most common reason for this is the overuse of antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="htlad-mob-square-fixed first_ad karma_unit inline hide-desktop"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a 2023 scientific article published in &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" title="StatPearls: Antibiotic Resistance" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513277/" target="_blank" data-citation="true"&gt;&lt;em&gt;StatPearls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “In 2015, 30 percent of the outpatient antibiotics prescribed were unnecessary, with acute respiratory infections holding the highest unnecessary use of antibiotics at 50 percent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More broadly speaking, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) refers to all instances in which bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites stop responding to medicines such as antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals, and antiparasitics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" title="WHO: Antimicrobial Resistance" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance" target="_blank" data-citation="true"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) estimates that “bacterial AMR was directly responsible for 1.27 million global deaths in 2019 and contributed to 4.95 million deaths.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/tums-heart-problems/" target="_blank"&gt;Doctors Warn These OTC Antacids Can Put Your Heart in Danger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scientists are also concerned about antibiotic resistance caused by other types of medications.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new study, published in the journal &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" title="Nature: The effect of commonly used non-antibiotic medications on antimicrobial resistance development in Escherichia coli" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44259-025-00144-w" target="_blank" data-citation="true"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, took a closer look at how non-antibiotic medications may contribute to antimicrobial resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers were especially concerned about the effects in residential aged care facilities, where patients are frequently given both antibiotics and non-antibiotic medications, including those for pain, sleep, and blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To arrive at their findings, the scientists from the University of South Australia (UniSA) investigated the effects of nine common non-antibiotic medications on the bacteria &lt;em&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/em&gt; (E. coli):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ibuprofen (Advil, an anti-inflammatory pain reliever)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diclofenac (Voltaren, an anti-inflammatory pain reliever used to treat arthritis)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acetaminophen (Tylenol, a drug to treat pain and fever)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Furosemide (a blood pressure-lowering drug)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metformin (a common diabetes drug)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Atorvastatin (Lipitor, a cholesterol-lowering drug)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tramadol (an opioid pain drug)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Temazepam (Restoril, a sleeping pill)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed, a decongestant)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E. coli most commonly causes gut (GI tract) infections and urinary tract infections (UTIs). It is treated with the antibiotic ciprofloxacin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/calcium-heart-attack-risk/" target="_blank"&gt;Taking Too Much of This Supplement Can Hurt Your Heart, Doctors Warn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Research shows that Tylenol and Advil can contribute to antibiotic resistance.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the researchers had their data, they employed whole-genome sequencing, a technology that determines the exact order of DNA in a human’s genome and can pinpoint genetic mutations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found that, of the nine medications, the two common OTC pain meds, Advil and Tylenol, drive antibiotic resistance when used individually and further amplify it when used together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When bacteria were exposed to ciprofloxacin alongside ibuprofen and paracetamol, they developed more genetic mutations than with the antibiotic alone, helping them grow faster and become highly resistant,” said lead researcher &lt;strong&gt;Rietie Venter&lt;/strong&gt;, an &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://people.unisa.edu.au/rietie.venter" target="_blank"&gt;associate professor&lt;/a&gt; at UniSA, in a &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1095896" target="_blank"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Worryingly, the bacteria were not only resistant to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, but increased resistance was also observed to multiple other antibiotics from different classes,” she continued. “We also uncovered the genetic mechanisms behind this resistance, with ibuprofen and paracetamol both activating the bacteria’s defences to expel antibiotics and render them less effective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venter explains that the research isn’t advocating for people to stop using Advil and Tylenol, but rather to be more mindful of how much they’re taking or prescribing and with what antibiotics. She and her team are planning further research into drug interactions and antibiotic resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians agree that the healthiest yogurt should be low in added sugar, high in protein, and contain live active cultures for gut health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Siggi’s Icelandic yogurt is their top pick, offering simple ingredients, minimal added sugar, and about 16 grams of protein per serving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beyond dairy options, Siggi’s also makes non-dairy yogurts with coconut milk and pea protein, providing a lower-sugar, probiotic-rich choice for plant-based eaters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As far as nutritional content goes, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/unexpected-add-in-turns-yogurt-into-fancy-treat-11780307" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;yogurt&lt;/a&gt; has a lot to offer. Not only does it provide gut-friendly probiotics, but it contains satiating protein and bone-supporting minerals too. Yogurt can also serve as a base for nutritious recipes, whether you’re making&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/easy-fruit-smoothie-recipes-7375286" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt; fruit smoothies&lt;/a&gt; or simple&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/yogurt-dip-with-herb-oil-recipe-7108449" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt; herb dips&lt;/a&gt;. But with &lt;em&gt;so &lt;/em&gt;many brands of yogurt to choose from, shopping for the ingredient can be overwhelming. When nutrition is your top priority, what should you look for when buying yogurt? And which brand stands out above the rest? To find out, we asked three dietitians to share their top pick for the healthiest yogurt brand, according to their expertise.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’d like to prioritize nutrition when buying yogurt, dietitians recommend considering the following criteria.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://eatinghealthy4life.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elizabeth Pecoraro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RDN, LD, a registered dietitian, cookbook author, and founder of Eating Healthy Nutrition, PLLC.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://simplywellnessllc.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samantha Peterson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MS, RD, a registered dietitian and founder of Simply Wellness&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Minimal Added Sugar &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “If you want to choose the healthiest type [of yogurt], my go-to advice is to look at the amount of&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/how-much-sugar-a-day" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; added sugar&lt;/a&gt;,” says registered dietitian Emer Delaney, RD. This is especially important for low-fat or reduced-calorie yogurts, which are made by replacing fat with sugar, per Delaney. This ensures the final product still tastes good. Registered dietitian Samantha Peterson, MS, RD, echoes this notion, sharing that many flavored yogurts can sneak in more sugar than a dessert.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Thus, if you’d like to lose weight, control your blood sugar, or build muscle, it’s worth paying attention to the amount of added sugar in your yogurt (and your overall diet), notes Delaney. Look for a yogurt with six to eight grams of added sugar per serving, advises Peterson. You can also opt for plain yogurt, then add sweeteners like date syrup or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/healthy-eating/honey-maple-syrup-better-sugar" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;honey&lt;/a&gt;, starting at one to two teaspoons, she adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Protein Content &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; A good yogurt should keep you satisfied for a few hours, notes Peterson. This is primarily due to&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/complete-protein-foods-6891861" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; protein&lt;/a&gt;, an essential nutrient that supports satiety and reduces hunger. So, choose a yogurt that has at least 10 grams of protein per serving, suggests registered dietitian Elizabeth Pecoraro, MS, RDN, LD. While you’re at it, pick &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/greek-yogurt-vs-cottage-cheese-11767885" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Greek&lt;/a&gt; or Icelandic yogurt, if possible. These styles tend to have more protein than regular varieties, according to Peterson.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Live and Active Cultures &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “These beneficial bacteria support a healthy &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-foods-for-gut-health-7098940" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;, which can &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-to-help-with-digestion-8680191" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;improve digestion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-for-immune-system-7093660" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;immune health&lt;/a&gt;, and even mood,” shares Peterson. To ensure your yogurt contains these&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/healthy-meals/what-is-a-probiotic" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt; probiotics&lt;/a&gt;, check the container for the “Live &amp;amp; Active Cultures” seal or specific strains like &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus acidophilus&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; Bifidobacterium bifidum&lt;/em&gt;, notes Pecoraro.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block realsimple-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Personal Needs &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Ultimately, the healthiest choice depends on your personal needs,” says Delaney. For example, if you’re trying to build muscle and lose weight, pick a yogurt that’s higher in protein to help control your appetite and support muscle growth, she explains. Or, if you’d like to control your blood sugar levels, “go for the unsweetened or low-sugar options and add some fruit for natural sweetness or a bit of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/cinnamon-recipes-8403727" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;cinnamon&lt;/a&gt; for extra flavor,” advises Delaney. Finally, “if you’re vegan or &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/popular-ingredients/cheese-can-eat-lactose-intolerant" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;lactose-intolerant&lt;/a&gt;, fortified plant-based yogurts are going to be your best fit,” Delaney adds. Examples include almond, soy, or coconut yogurts, she points out. In this case, choose a product with added&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/health/nutrition-diet/high-calcium-foods" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt; calcium&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-high-in-vitamin-d-8781864" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="4"&gt; vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, as some plant-based yogurts are naturally lower in these nutrients than those made with cow’s milk.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Siggi’s&lt;/strong&gt; wins first place as the healthiest yogurt brand, according to all three dietitians. Overall, the brand checks the boxes mentioned earlier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not only do Siggi’s Icelandic yogurts boast simple ingredients lists, but nearly every variety is low in added sugar, Pecoraro points out. “While some of their flavored options do have added sugar, it’s minimal compared to typical fruit-on-the-bottom brands,” she adds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Additionally, at 16 grams of protein per serving, “it’s a great snack &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.realsimple.com/foods-to-eat-after-a-workout-8681539" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;after your workout&lt;/a&gt; or a brilliant addition to your meals to help increase your protein intake,” Delaney says. Siggi’s also provides calcium and vitamin B12, which support &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/best-foods-for-bone-health-7495764" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;bone health&lt;/a&gt; and energy production, respectively, Peterson notes.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But that’s not all: Siggi’s yogurts contain live bacteria, including &lt;em&gt;Bifidobacterium&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Lactobacillus acidophilus&lt;/em&gt;, which means it’s great for your gut health, according to Delaney. Peterson agrees, sharing that “the live, active cultures feed your gut’s ‘good’ bacteria, which support digestion and overall gut balance.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Finally, Siggi’s&lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/healthiest-dairy-non-dairy-yogurts-study-7514830" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; non-dairy yogurts&lt;/a&gt; are made with &lt;a href="https://www.realsimple.com/food-recipes/recipe-collections-favorites/popular-ingredients/coconut-milk" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;coconut milk&lt;/a&gt;, which are &lt;em&gt;also &lt;/em&gt;lower in sugar than many other plant-based brands, shares Pecoraro. These varieties contain added protein (in the form of pea protein) and live cultures as well.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Real Simple</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimgFBVV95cUxNZkpJd2tmQnNpUjZmeERsWGcyVWd0NnRFNFFfZTg5TG1lVkxCNzVONmtrRmVJU2ZXdWxZNjBxYjI5eDhGczRxNU9fVlVtdUd1Uy16VmxCRi1zRWI5My12dmF4c2cxQnNPbWpoWnh3MjRicDUxeGxCallBNmFqRTl3cFpiUkVFRTg2anFRYy1aNmptbnlfRm52cElR</guid></item><item><title>贝多芬的头发DNA揭示了他去世近200年后的惊人秘密！ -《印度国防评论》</title><link>https://indiandefencereview.com/beethoven-dna-secret-200-years-after-death/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="dynamic-entry-content"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking study involving DNA analysis of Beethoven’s remains has provided fresh insights into the composer’s health, genetic lineage, and possible causes behind his legendary hearing loss. &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(23)00181-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the study, led by biochemist Johannes Krause at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, explored Beethoven’s genetic makeup in an effort to uncover the mysteries of his declining health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Beethoven’s Health and Genetic Legacy&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beethoven’s health &lt;/strong&gt;has long been a subject of fascination for historians, biographers, and medical experts alike. Most famously, the composer experienced progressive &lt;strong&gt;hearing loss &lt;/strong&gt;starting in his mid-to-late twenties, eventually becoming functionally deaf by 1818. The loss of his hearing didn’t stop him from composing some of the world’s most iconic music, but it did raise questions about the causes behind this condition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/983032" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;In a press statement released in 2023&lt;/a&gt;, biochemist &lt;strong&gt;Johannes Krause&lt;/strong&gt; noted, “Our primary goal was to shed light on Beethoven’s health problems, which famously include progressive hearing loss, beginning in his mid- to late-20s and eventually leading to him being functionally deaf by 1818.” The research team hoped to identify genetic factors that could explain these conditions, but Krause admitted that they were unable to find a definitive cause for Beethoven’s hearing loss or his gastrointestinal problems, which he struggled with throughout his life.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the lack of a clear answer, the study’s findings offer a glimpse into the&lt;strong&gt; genetic makeup&lt;/strong&gt; of one of history’s most influential composers, adding another layer to the understanding of his extraordinary life and work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Genetic Insights into Beethoven’s Family Lineage&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the study didn’t find conclusive evidence linking &lt;strong&gt;Beethoven’s deafness to a genetic disorder&lt;/strong&gt;, it did provide a fascinating look at his family’s genetic history. One of the most intriguing findings from the research was the revelation of a genetic event that occurred in Beethoven’s paternal line several generations before his birth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tristan Begg&lt;/strong&gt;, a biological anthropologist involved in the study, explained, “This finding suggests an extrapair paternity event in his paternal line between the conception of&lt;strong&gt; Hendrik van Beethoven in Kampenhout&lt;/strong&gt;, Belgium in c.1572 and the conception of &lt;strong&gt;Ludwig van Beethoven &lt;/strong&gt;seven generations later in 1770, in Bonn, Germany.” Essentially, the analysis indicated that an extramarital affair or affair involving Beethoven’s paternal ancestors could have contributed to a complex genetic heritage that stretches back centuries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While this finding doesn’t necessarily offer direct insights into &lt;strong&gt;Beethoven’s health issues&lt;/strong&gt;, it sheds light on the potential genetic diversity within his family. Understanding the genealogy of such a prominent historical figure adds nuance to our understanding of his life and legacy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Beethoven’s Genetic Markers and Health Complications&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another crucial element of the research involved analyzing the&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/genetic-evidence-leprosy-ancient-american/" data-type="post" data-id="84205"&gt; genetic markers&lt;/a&gt; related to diseases that could have affected&lt;strong&gt; Beethoven’s health&lt;/strong&gt;. The study looked at various genes associated with hearing loss, gastrointestinal disorders, and other ailments that the composer endured. Though the researchers didn’t identify a definitive cause for his hearing loss or chronic abdominal issues, they noted several genetic markers that could have contributed to his overall health complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;These findings support the hypothesis that Beethoven may have had a hereditary predisposition to certain health problems. It’s also possible that environmental factors, such as his diet, stress levels, or even infections, played a role in exacerbating his conditions. Unfortunately, the study did not uncover any clear genetic connection to&lt;strong&gt; Beethoven’s well-known health struggles&lt;/strong&gt;, but it provided valuable data for future research into genetic disorders of similar nature.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Intersection of Genetics and Artistry&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research on &lt;strong&gt;Beethoven’s DNA &lt;/strong&gt;also highlights the fascinating intersection between genetics and creativity. Many have wondered how Beethoven, despite his worsening hearing loss, was able to continue composing music at the highest level. His ability to produce groundbreaking symphonies and piano concertos despite his deafness has been a source of inspiration for many.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the study did not pinpoint a genetic factor that could explain Beethoven’s extraordinary artistic abilities, the sheer complexity of his genetic history raises intriguing possibilities. Could his lineage or certain genetic traits have contributed to his exceptional creativity and resilience in the face of adversity? These questions remain unanswered but serve as a reminder of the mysterious relationship between genetics, health, and talent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Legacy of Beethoven’s Health and Genetics&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study of &lt;strong&gt;Beethoven’s DNA &lt;/strong&gt;is just one part of a broader effort to understand the composer’s life, health, and legacy. While much is still unknown about the specific causes of his health issues, the research has contributed significantly to the ongoing dialogue surrounding Beethoven’s genius and struggles. The analysis also offers a glimpse into the broader field of genetic research on historical figures, shedding light on the possibilities and limitations of genetic analysis in understanding the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Even though the research team was unable to pinpoint a clear explanation for Beethoven’s health problems, the study has opened up new avenues for understanding the intersections of health, history, and genetics. In many ways, Beethoven’s health challenges are as enigmatic as his music, and this study provides a valuable step forward in unlocking the secrets of both.&lt;/p&gt;

Sadly, one truth is well-known: As we age, so does our brain.

By analyzing how &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/animals/a35884787/humans-share-genes-with-weird-headless-creatures/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:genes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;genes&lt;/a&gt; and proteins changed over time in mice, the team identified a troublesome protein named ferritin light chain 1, or FTL1. When scientists reduced the presence of this protein in the hippocampus, the mice regained some of their youthful characteristics, including improved nerve connections and better permorfance on memory tests. The results of the study were published &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs43587-025-00940-z&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Fscience%2Fhealth%2Fa65865756%2Faging-brain%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:in the journal Nature Aging;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in the journal &lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“It is truly a reversal of impairments […]. It’s much more than merely delaying or preventing symptoms,” Saul Villeda, a co-author of the study from UCSF, said &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/08/430551/protein-slows-aging-brain-and-we-know-how-counter-it" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:in a press statement;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;in a press statement&lt;/a&gt;. “We’re seeing more opportunities to alleviate the worst consequences of old age.

When analyzing the effects of FTL1 protein in a petri dish, Villeda and his team discerned that nerve cells engineered simple, one armed neural wires—known as “neurites”—rather than the branching neurites typical of normal neural cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“To identify potential therapeutic targets to restore cognitive function in older people, we first need to gain mechanistic insight into the molecular drivers of cognitive decline in the &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a65583845/study-finds-reverse-aging-in-humans/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;aging&lt;/a&gt; brain,” the authors wrote. “It has become clear that cognitive dysfunction in the aged brain in the absence of neurodegenerative disease is not paralleled by cell death but, instead, by a decline in neuronal function at the synaptic level.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The authors also note that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fncomms7760&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Fscience%2Fhealth%2Fa65865756%2Faging-brain%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:a 2015 study;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link  rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;a 2015 study&lt;/a&gt; found that increased ferritin levels in cerebrospinal fluid negatively impacted cognitive performance and accurately predicted conversion from mild cognitive impairment to &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/gaming/a14393872/video-games-prevent-alzheimers/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alzheimer’s disease;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;.

Some of them can lead to severe or life-threatening illnesses, particularly for newborns and people who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-11d871" class="body-graf"&gt;Monitoring for the six pathogens is no longer required for the 10 states that participate in the program, though those states aren’t precluded from conducting surveillance on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-646ede" class="body-graf"&gt;Food safety experts worry that the move, which hasn’t previously been made public, could make it harder for public health officials to notice whether certain foodborne illnesses are rising and then slow response time to outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-82c2b1" class="body-graf"&gt;FoodNet is a collaboration among the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration, the Agriculture Department and 10 state health departments. Its surveillance area covers roughly 54 million people, or 16% of the U.S. population. The network includes Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Tennessee and select counties in California and New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-747166" class="body-graf"&gt;“Although FoodNet will narrow its focus to &lt;em&gt;Salmonella &lt;/em&gt;and STEC, it will maintain both its infrastructure and the quality it has come to represent,” the CDC spokesperson wrote. “Narrowing FoodNet’s reporting requirements and associated activities will allow FoodNet staff to prioritize core activities.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-3813e3" class="body-graf"&gt;A list of talking points the CDC provided to the Connecticut Public Health Department, viewed by NBC News, cites a reason for the change: “Funding has not kept pace with the resources required to maintain the continuation of FoodNet surveillance for all eight pathogens.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-e9263d" class="body-graf"&gt;The CDC spokesperson said Monday that other systems conduct national surveillance for the six pathogens that were removed from FoodNet. For instance, state health departments are still able to report cases through the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System&lt;/a&gt;. And the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/php/surveillance/listeria-initiative.html" target="_blank"&gt;Listeria Initiative&lt;/a&gt; collects reports of laboratory-confirmed cases of listeriosis — serious infections from eating food contaminated with listeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-f1db3a" class="body-graf"&gt;But FoodNet is the only surveillance system that actively looks for multiple foodborne diseases at the federal level, according to food safety experts. Other federal surveillance systems are passive, meaning the CDC relies on state health departments to notify it of cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-aeeb8d" class="body-graf"&gt;Experts worry that without active surveillance of all eight pathogens, public health officials won’t be able to adequately compare trends over time or notice whether cases of a particular illness start rising. Experts also worry that scaling back FoodNet’s operations could make it harder to quickly identify and respond to outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-8dfed0" class="body-graf"&gt;Barbara Kowalcyk, director of the Institute for Food Safety and Nutrition Security at George Washington University, called the decision to reduce FoodNet surveillance “very disappointing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-839248" class="body-graf"&gt;“A lot of the work that I and many, many, many, many other people have put into improving food safety over the past 20 or 30 years is just going away,” she said. Kowalcyk’s son died in 2001 of complications from a foodborne E. coli infection, and since then she has advocated for improvements to U.S. food safety policy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-a2a792" class="body-graf"&gt;Kowalcyk said that the federal budget for food safety hasn’t kept up with the cost of inflation and that &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/trump-administrations-deep-cuts-to-public-health-leave-system-reeling" target="_blank"&gt;cuts to federal funding for state health departments&lt;/a&gt; have most likely made it harder to maintain FoodNet surveillance. The CDC requested a $72 million &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/budget/documents/fy2026/fy-2026-cdc-cj.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;budget for food safety&lt;/a&gt; for the 2026 fiscal year, about the same as it has requested in years past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-dd6879" class="body-graf"&gt;It’s not entirely clear how the changes to FoodNet are affecting surveillance on the state level so far. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-651cc4" class="body-graf"&gt;The Oregon and Connecticut health departments said they were aware of the changes as of Monday. Meanwhile, the Georgia Public Health Department said Friday that it hadn’t received any official notice from the CDC. And the New Mexico Health Department said it was awaiting notification from the CDC to determine the scope of its future surveillance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-315df3" class="body-graf"&gt;The Maryland Health Department said the state’s health care providers and clinical laboratories are required to report cases of all eight pathogens monitored by FoodNet, so the reporting will continue “regardless of changes to the FoodNet network.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="anchor-c4bdcd" class="endmark body-graf"&gt;The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said it will need to scale back active surveillance activities for some pathogens if funding is decreased in 2026. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 13:12:41 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxOQVNudmwwVnZ1Tl9ZWjB4OUxvZHNFLWJxdW1PdGlnT2lIV1E2V1pZZ2E5Y25udS02Q01GQUZseGExdnZTcVYxUGdXRk1PT1A5emxJMWlaRFBncWpROGRyTFRZX3dOY3VEM0Q4MXB1NE0tRVdZU3FPWmp1UVl1c0lYdXZsaVptVEk1TEo1eGhjUnpzUUR5QXVpYjdhX3Z0SjhxdnB1OXdaZnNCUE04RmdlUHdSd0hsREtzVXfSAVZBVV95cUxPamdORWh6emFhcy1IR1EyX0NTRmxXNVJPMlY3X1FFYjFjNXc3bEJ3ZHhfVzNTMDF4aHBRXzlydUcwNzJ0a1BBNlpOempWQU40WmozS3hoQQ</guid></item><item><title>拉里默县居民死于西尼罗河病毒- KDVR</title><link>https://kdvr.com/news/local/larimer-county-resident-dies-from-west-nile-virus/</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

Results were categorized by association direction and by study characteristics. Therapeutic studies were defined by use of cannabis to treat medical conditions or symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Data Synthesis:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ninety-nine studies (221 097 participants) were included: randomized trials (42%), observational studies (47%), and other interventional study designs (11%); more than 95% had moderate or high risk of bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In studies not testing for therapeutic effects, high-concentration THC products showed consistent unfavorable associations with psychosis or schizophrenia (70%) and CUD (75%). No therapeutic studies reported favorable results for psychosis or schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anxiety and depression, 53% and 41% of nontherapeutic studies, respectively, reported unfavorable associations, especially among healthy populations. Among therapeutic studies, nearly half found benefits for anxiety (47%) and depression (48%), although some also found unfavorable associations (24% and 30%, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Limitation:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moderate and high risk of bias of individual studies and limited evaluation of contemporary products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-concentration THC products are associated with unfavorable mental health outcomes, particularly for psychosis or schizophrenia and CUD.

The defective cells can also accumulate, preventing the development of red blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This causes anaemia, leading to breathlessness, fatigue and, as Mr Blackburn experienced, kidney failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Whilst the cancer can be treated, it cannot yet be cured. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Blackburn's stem cell transplant involved healthy bone marrow cells from a donor being introduced to the bloodstream, helping the body produce fully functioning white blood cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was a gruelling treatment,' Mr Blackburn recalled. 'It seriously affected my life, I lost weight, strength, stamina  and my hair—I could barely walk across the room.' &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The avid cyclist was quickly diagnosed with kidney failure &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The avid cyclist also required regular dialysis—a procedure to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys stop working properly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This involves diverting blood to a machine to be cleaned before being filtered back into the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the NHS, common side-effects of the treatment include fatigue, low blood pressure, muscle cramps, joint pain and difficulties sleeping. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'To begin with, I'd have severe headaches and nausea,' Mr Blackburn said. 'I would spending evenings after dialysis throwing up before sleeping for 12 hours.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Thankfully, the treatment worked and Mr Burton was given the all clear in October 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite this, he still needs three hour-long dialysis sessions a week to keep his kidney functioning properly, which he says has had a 'huge impact' on his life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After his stem cell treatment, Mr Blackburn was determined to build up his strength, despite feeling that he would never be strong enough to ride again with his cycling group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I realised I was really missing the social aspect and decided to purchase an eclectic bike to help me keep up,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Further tests revealed that his kidneys were failing as a result of a rare but aggressive blood cancer &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tim underwent nine gruelling months of chemotherapy and relentless dialysis sessions before he was given the all clear in October 2023&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tim still has to have three dialysis sessions a week to keep his body functioning properly whilst he waits for a kidney replacement &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Mr Blackburn has since cycled over 200 miles across Somerset and Devon while visiting dialysis centres—to raise money for Kidney Research UK, in a challenge he dubbed 'Tour de Kidney'. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He initially aimed to raise £2,040—£5 for each of the 408 dialysis sessions he has had since January 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But he has since tripled his goal, raising £6,205 through &lt;a class="" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/tim-blackburn-3"&gt;JustGiving&lt;/a&gt; in aid of research into the prevention, treatment and management of kidney disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He said: 'I had a great time and felt a huge feeling of satisfaction in what we've achieved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The staff at the dialysis clinics were all wonderful, giving me a cheer when I arrived and set back off again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was hard work, there were a lot of gills to cycle up, but it was very rewarding.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Symptoms of myeloma can vary widely, as not all patients will develop symptoms of the disease and are often diagnosed by chance following a blood test for something else. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bone pain—often felt in the back, hips, shoulders or ribs—extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, muscle weakness, headaches, extreme thirst and unexplained weight loss are all tell-tale signs of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blurred vision, dizziness, unexplained bruising, and unusual bleeding such as frequent nosebleeds or heavy periods can also be signs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a diagnosis, patients should be aware of the signs and symptoms of infection, as their immune system is compromised meaning that an infection can get worse in a matter of hours, increasing the risk of sepsis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Blood Cancer UK advises anyone who is concerned they may myeloma to contact their GP and inform them of any signs of an infection, such as a fever, flu like symptoms, or a very low temperature below 36°C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to Cancer Research UK, there are around 6,200 new myeloma cases in the UK every year, and 3,100 deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Almost 80 per cent of patients will survive their myeloma for five years or more after diagnosis if caught early. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At stage three, when the cancer has spread and affects more of the body, the prognosis is much lower, with only 40 per cent of patients surviving for five years after diagnosis.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 12:05:23 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirwFBVV95cUxPYVFSdkVsVVg2c1l6SmwzelJIWUlZVXpIbnc3S2JGSlBjSEk2WG5VWElkbmVMeGJta0hHbzNYVGVNc2lZSWI4VWxJd0d4RjRHTUQxa3FmUzY2cEtYTjByTnB2cXFJQUVzX0ZrVld5bTl0azg2WHJVOU5kOGhXY3NrMDFZUzJwYlpQeTRwaU40SWRmdHZtRDFMM2VTUVRsTUtYMTBLbVp6SDlrcF93Vmlr0gG0AUFVX3lxTFBia085QS1BejVDWDBPeXlaaU1Ha3ljUlZlZFFuY3dhWDh4UHpVSVhLd00wcmh5WVpfWW16RjZ1WTZDUXVPeUNISkt3Rmx4YURUX1VpQm83MHBLRm1ocXNfRllsNkpxRnhGdkZyWk5rYUpBa2w3SWM3VWJTWnBNMm51cmRheDR1dDVBOW1nbVNBSlZxQ3VZbzM0clVvSEFnNmxzUHZmQTJFT0ZqVG15M0xMNXV4OA</guid></item><item><title>猪肺移植到人类在主要科学第一- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/pig-lung-transplanted-into-a-human-in-major-scientific-first</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;A genetically modified pig lung transplanted into a &lt;a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/brain-death"&gt;brain-dead&lt;/a&gt; human patient functioned for nine days in a new achievement that reveals both the promise and significant challenges of xenotransplantation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the experiment, the patient showed increasing signs of organ rejection before scientists at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University in China terminated the experiment, allowing the recipient to pass away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's the first time a pig lung has been transplanted into a human patient, demonstrating a significant step forward, and giving scientists new problems to solve as they develop this emerging medical technique further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/world-first-pig-kidney-transplant-was-a-huge-breakthrough-but-is-it-the-future"&gt;&lt;b&gt;World-First Pig Kidney Transplant Was a Huge Breakthrough, But Is It The Future?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The availability of suitable human donor organs presents a major bottleneck for patients in need of a transplant. To help resolve this issue, doctors have been investigating the possibilities presented by xenotransplantation: genetically modifying organs from non-human animals – mainly pigs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These modified pig organs are not intended to be permanent solutions for the patient, but a stop-gap '&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/TP.0b013e3181ba0555"&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt;' solution while they wait for a donor organ to become available.  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="172116" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; using pig kidneys and livers have shown promise, although further development and research is still needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each organ presents its own unique complexities and obstacles. A team led by surgeon Jianxing He of Guangzhou Medical University has now tackled the next major challenge: lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of the experiment was not to achieve a successful transplantation on the first try – that would have been pretty incredible, but not a realistic expectation. Rather, the researchers wanted to observe how the patient's immune system responded to the transplanted organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_172120" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172120" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/trachea.jpg" alt="" class="size-full wp-image-172120" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/trachea.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/trachea-539x415.jpg 539w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/08/trachea-600x462.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-172120" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers preparing the pig lung for transplantation. (He et al., &lt;em&gt;Nat. Med.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient was a 39-year-old man who was declared brain-dead by four separate clinical assessments after undergoing a brain hemorrhage. His family provided written informed consent for the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The donor pig is what is known as a six-gene-edited pig, a Bama miniature pig with six  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/crispr-gene-editing" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73025" data-postid="172116" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;CRISPR&lt;/a&gt; gene edits, housed in an isolated facility with rigorous disinfection protocols. These edits are all focused on minimizing the immune and inflammatory responses of the patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a careful surgical procedure, the pig's left lung was placed into the patient's chest cavity, and connected to their airways, arteries, and veins. The paper does not explain the fate of the pig, but donor pigs do not typically survive the removal of a major organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patient was also treated with a number of immunosuppressants that the researchers adjusted according to changes observed in the patient's body over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, all seemed well, with none of the immediate signs of hyperacute rejection in the critical few hours following the procedure. However, by 24 hours after the transplant had taken place, severe swelling (edema) was observed, possibly as a result of blood flow being restored to the area of the transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antibody-mediated rejection damaged the tissue further on days three and six of the experiment. The result of the damage was &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1097/MOT.0000000000001065"&gt;primary graft dysfunction&lt;/a&gt;, a type of severe lung injury occurring within 72 hours of a transplant, and the leading cause of death in lung transplant patients. Some recovery was taking place by day nine, but the experiment had run its course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Related: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/pig-liver-successfully-transplanted-into-human-patient-in-world-first"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pig Liver Successfully Transplanted Into Human Patient in World First&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lungs are a very complicated organ to transplant, because they have immediate contact with air from outside the body. This means they need to form an effective line of first defense, acting as a barrier against airborne pathogens and particles. As such, they have multiple mechanisms they can call on for an immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were able to show that they could transplant a pig lung into a human patient in a way that circumvents the dangers of hyperacute rejection, which is an important first step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The early onset of pulmonary edema underscores the importance of preventing primary graft dysfunction in future xenogeneic lung transplantation," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03861-x"&gt;the researchers write in their paper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Continued efforts are needed to optimize immunosuppressive regimens, refine genetic modifications, enhance lung preservation strategies and assess long-term graft function beyond the acute phase.&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03861-x"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By addressing these challenges, future studies can refine the approach to lung xenotransplantation and move closer to clinical translation. This study provides crucial insights into the immune, physiological and genetic barriers that must be overcome, and paves the way for further innovations in the field."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-03861-x"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Exercise is a cornerstone of good health and evidence shows it can even help &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/exercise-proves-powerful-in-preventing-colon-cancer-recurrence-new-study-257983"&gt;prevent cancers returning&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2502760"&gt;following treatment&lt;/a&gt;. But new findings are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/health/running-colon-cancer.html"&gt;raising an unexpected question&lt;/a&gt;: could very high-volume endurance training carry its own risks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting, researchers from Inova Schar Cancer Institute reported that a surprising number of dedicated marathon and ultramarathon runners had precancerous growths in their colons. Among 100 athletes aged 35 to 50, &lt;a href="https://www.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/ABSTRACT491966"&gt;15% had advanced adenomas&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/nejmra1513581"&gt;lesions&lt;/a&gt; that can develop into bowel cancer – while 41% had at least one adenoma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study is small and not yet peer-reviewed, but the signal is strong enough to have &lt;a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-14768309/colon-cancer-running-asco-2025.html"&gt;captured&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/health/running-colon-cancer.html"&gt;global&lt;/a&gt; attention. Here’s what the findings really mean, why experts urge caution in interpreting the results, and what runners should watch for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first glance, it seems counterintuitive. &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/five-ways-to-cut-your-risk-of-cancer-by-an-oncology-consultant-245858"&gt;Decades of evidence&lt;/a&gt; show regular exercise &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6527123/"&gt;lowers cancer risks&lt;/a&gt;, including bowel cancer, and improves outcomes &lt;a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/59/14/1010"&gt;after a cancer diagnosis&lt;/a&gt;. This study doesn’t overturn that science. Instead, it suggests a narrow group of young, very high–volume endurance athletes might face unique bowel stress that could increase their odds of developing precancerous changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/colon-cancer-rates-are-rising-among-young-people-could-changes-to-childrens-gut-bacteria-explain-why-255176"&gt;Young people with colon cancer&lt;/a&gt; has been called a new epidemic, and &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/bowel-cancer-is-on-the-rise-in-under-50s-heres-what-might-explain-the-trend-246447"&gt;we don’t really understand&lt;/a&gt; why it’s &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/alcohol-plays-a-major-role-in-new-cancer-cases/"&gt;increasing&lt;/a&gt; so much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Inova study deliberately excluded people with known genetic conditions or bowel disease to focus on runners who otherwise seemed low risk. Yet their screening found more advanced lesions than expected for that age group – a pattern outside experts, commenting in the New York Times, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/health/running-colon-cancer.html"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; as worth investigating, not a final answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How might heavy endurance training contribute to bowel changes? One theory focuses on temporary blood flow reductions to the gut during prolonged, intense exercise. Distance runners are familiar with &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5675973/"&gt;runner’s colitis&lt;/a&gt; – cramping and occasional bleeding after long runs. Repeated cycles of low–oxygen stress, inflammation and tissue repair in the bowel could, theoretically, encourage adenoma development in susceptible people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Inova team highlighted this mechanism based on observations and runners’ reports of gut symptoms, though the study didn’t directly measure blood flow, oxygen or inflammation markers. It also didn’t isolate other lifestyle factors that might matter, such as dehydration strategies, anti–inflammatory drug use, specific nutrition practices, or very low body fat levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as important is what this study doesn’t establish. It doesn’t prove marathons or ultramarathons cause bowel cancer. It doesn’t show most young–onset bowel cancers occur in runners – doctors not involved in the study &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/19/health/running-colon-cancer.html"&gt;emphasised&lt;/a&gt; that most younger patients with these cancers aren’t endurance athletes. And it doesn’t address whether more moderate exercise carries similar risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The comparison point – the expected rate of &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1309086"&gt;advanced adenomas&lt;/a&gt; in the late 40s – comes from broader population studies, not from a matched control group. That makes the observed difference notable but still preliminary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The research is clinically grounded, but its size and design mean it should be seen as a starting point for larger studies rather than a basis for changing general &lt;a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/coping/physically/exercise-guidelines"&gt;exercise&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040842825001064"&gt;guidance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, there are practical lessons for endurance athletes and doctors. First, persistent blood in stool, changes in bowel habits, unexplained stomach pain, or iron–deficiency anaemia shouldn’t be dismissed as “just running”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a community where gut complaints are common and often normalised, it’s easy to miss warning signs. The lead oncologist argued that young runners with bleeding after long runs should be offered screening – a stance grounded in the fact that colonoscopy can remove precancerous lesions and prevent cancers developing. This is more cautious than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/colorectal-cancer/screening/index.html"&gt;current guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for average–risk adults but aligns with individualised, symptom–driven care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, the study reinforces the difference between exercise as medicine and exercise as extreme sport. For &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38920329/"&gt;cancer prevention and overall health&lt;/a&gt;, the strongest &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-024-02748-x"&gt;evidence supports regular&lt;/a&gt;, moderate–to–vigorous &lt;a href="https://cancerci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12935-022-02670-3"&gt;activity&lt;/a&gt;, not necessarily repeated ultra–endurance feats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center "&gt;
            
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Polyps can be removed during colonoscopy.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/colon-polyp-found-large-intestine-person-2326990455"&gt;WendyJo/Shutterstock.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Careful attention needed – not panic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recent conferences highlighted data showing structured exercise after bowel cancer treatment improves long–term outcomes, underlining that physical activity remains one of the most powerful, low–cost tools in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6527123/"&gt;cancer prevention and care&lt;/a&gt;. This runner study doesn’t contradict that larger story. It flags a potential exception at the extreme end of training that needs careful attention, not panic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If future research confirms a link, what might change? Screening recommendations could evolve for a clearly defined group of high–volume endurance athletes, perhaps starting colonoscopy earlier than the current age–45 threshold for average–risk adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Athletes and coaches might adapt training, nutrition and recovery to protect gut health – paying attention to hydration, heat stress, gradual progression, and avoiding unnecessary anti–inflammatory medication around long efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sports medicine and gastroenterology clinics might work together on protocols for evaluating gut bleeding in runners, narrowing the gap between &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10116569/"&gt;“common” and “concerning”&lt;/a&gt; symptoms. But these steps depend on replication in larger, diverse groups and understanding which components of endurance life – intensity, duration, heat, altitude, nutrition – matter most.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, a balanced message serves the public best. Endurance running is a profound source of meaning and health for many people, and quitting running isn’t the lesson from a single small study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key is keeping the proven benefits of exercise in view while being clear–eyed about potential risks at extremes. Listen to your body’s signals, especially bleeding. Treat red–flag symptoms as medical, not merely athletic. And discuss personal risk factors and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4955831/"&gt;family history&lt;/a&gt; with your doctor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As science probes this signal further, the likely outcome isn’t a blanket warning but more nuanced guidance: who might need earlier screening, when to investigate symptoms, and how to train hard with the gut in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study’s real contribution may be cultural as much as clinical: it gives runners and doctors permission to ask a question they’ve too often waved away, and to catch dangerous lesions before they become cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

Once these symptoms started up again, I went for a blood test and they found I had really elevated prolactin. Doctors said it can mean one of two things – either you're breastfeeding – which I wasn't – or you've got another tumour.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After an MRI, Loz was diagnosed with a new tumour on her pituitary gland again, as well as a growth on her pineal gland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The pineal gland regulates wake and sleep cycles, so the growth there was really contributing to my fatigue.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On top of severe exhaustion, Loz's immune system faltered, leaving her battling a continuous stream of viruses and infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Because my sleep was so out of whack with the pineal gland growth, my immune system had become a joke and I seemed to catch one thing after the other.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Loz turned to an integrative medicine doctor she had been working with for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Loz was battling crippling fatigue and weight gain, despite a diligent exercise routine and healthy diet&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After being diagnosed with a tumour on her pituitary gland, Loz's sleep suffered and she was unable to have conversations early in the morning or late in the afternoon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He said, "Look, the main thing is we have to get you feeling less like s***."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'He put me on a supplement called NMN. Within a couple of weeks, I felt absolutely amazing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;NMN, or nicotinamide mononucleotide, is a naturally occurring molecule found in all living organisms. It serves as a direct precursor to NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide), a critical coenzyme involved in hundreds of metabolic processes. Think of NAD+ as the body's energy currency, fuelling everything from DNA repair to cellular metabolism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The scientific community has long been aware of the importance of NAD+, but it's the discovery of NMN's role in the process that has ignited recent research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr David Sinclair, Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and co-author of Lifespan: Why We Age – and Why We Don't Have To, found that supplementing with NMN could significantly boost NAD+ levels in mice, effectively reversing age-related blindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, says the professor, was a defining moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It wasn't just about restoring vision,' he explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It proved that ageing is not a one-way street. We turned back the clock in complex tissues without causing cancer, which lent credence to the "Information Theory of Ageing" – the idea that the body ages due to a loss of youthful information, which can be reinstalled, like software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;After using a $2 supplement called NMN given to her by an integrative medicine doctor, Loz's energy levels soared&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'So, if we learn to reboot this software safely, ageing may be reversible in humans, too.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;So, how does NMN work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It helps to think about the process as supply and demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;As we age, our NAD+ levels naturally decline, leaving cells with less of the fuel they need to function optimally. When NMN is introduced, the body readily converts it into NAD+.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By replenishing NAD+ levels, NMN is believed to support cellular health, potentially slowing some aspects of the ageing process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The implications of this are significant, with ongoing clinical trials exploring its potential benefits in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The explosive popularity of the supplement in recent years has led to a number of different brands hitting the market. Here in Australia, a 120-day supply can cost between $79 and $200, which means you'll pay between 60c and $2 per day. (Over in America, 120-day supplies start at around US$60, or 50c per day).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Loz says her sleep evened out soon after taking the supplement NMN and she was able to throw herself into her work as a public speaker and life coach&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Before I started taking it, all of my cognition had been compromised by this tumour,' explained Loz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I literally couldn't have a conversation before ten o'clock in the morning or after four o'clock in the afternoon. It felt as if my brain was stuck buffering, like an old dial-up modem.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I'm a professional speaker, so you can imagine what it was like getting up on stage and not being able to remember your own freaking speech,' she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It was so debilitating professionally as well as personally.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After NMN, however, the brain fog lifted almost immediately for Loz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Suddenly, my sleep evened out. I could remember everything again. I had so much more energy and it even changed my body composition. My training finally made a difference and even my hairdresser exclaimed, "What are you doing? This is amazing!" My hair had actually outgrown its extensions.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Buoyed by her results, Loz began exploring whether or not she could also supplement with NAD+ itself. After all, if the NMN helped replenish NAD+ levels, surely supplementing directly with NAD+ would yield even better results?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This, as it turns out, is a slightly more complex proposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I learnt NAD+ can't be taken orally as a supplement,' Loz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She's correct. NAD+ is a delicate molecule, and the process of travelling through a human digestive system means it's essentially destroyed before it's able to be converted into a useful tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A growing body of research suggests taking NAD+ subcutaneously – as an injection under the skin – makes it more bioavailable for your body to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I began cycling NAD+ boosters subcutaneously,' Loz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The improvements, again, were amazing.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Loz will continue to cycle on and off the NAD+ while consistently taking her NMN supplements to have the maximum benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'With the health issues I've had over the years, I've spent $600,000 over two decades just to stay alive – just to stay on this side of the ground, let alone to be thriving,' Loz says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'If I'd only listened to the mainstream advice, I never would have explored the NAD+ or NMN. Now, I don't take medications for anything, and I feel incredible.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A deadly tropical disease known as sleeping sickness has been eliminated from Kenya in a significant public health triumph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The East African nation is the 10th on the continent to achieve the milestone, but also the most populous to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) results from the parasite &lt;em&gt;Trypanosoma &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;brucei, &lt;/em&gt;that spreads to humans through the bites of the tsetse fly. As with many neglected tropical diseases, its hunting ground is rural areas or poor communities with limited access to medical services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replicating in the bloodstream and lymphatic system, the mature parasite causes personality changes, confusion, poor coordination, and disrupted sleep cycles that give the disease its name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I congratulate the government and people of Kenya on this landmark achievement,” said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “Kenya joins the growing ranks of countries freeing their populations of HAT. This is another step towards making Africa free of neglected tropical diseases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="pgs-dpg-flex" data-pgs-partner-id="good-news-network"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleeping sickness is often fatal if untreated and was a scourge in sub-Saharan Africa in the 1990s. 40,000 cases were being diagnosed in a year, but an impressive mobilization of human and development capital has seen that number fall 40-fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAFER AND SAFER: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Safer treatments, simpler diagnostic methods, and community awareness building to help villagers detect early signs of the parasite all contributed to the eradication in Kenya, which joins Uganda, Rwanda, Benin, Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire, Guinea, Equatorial Guinea, Chad, and Togo which have also eliminated sleeping sickness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This validation marks a major public health milestone for Kenya, as we celebrate the elimination of a deadly disease in our country,” &lt;a href="https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20250823-who-declares-kenya-free-of-deadly-sleeping-sickness-after-decades" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Dr. Aden Duale, Kenya’s Secretary for Health. “The achievement will not only protect our people but also pave the way for renewed economic growth and prosperity.”&lt;/p&gt;

But creating a weekly meal plan can be a lot of work, and hiring a nutritionist to do it for you can be expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in many aspects of life these days, some people are turning to AI to craft their meal plans as a bit of a shortcut. And while this might seem like a win-win scenario — it’s fast, it’s free and it’s easy — is using AI for your meal planning actually a good idea? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To help parse this out, we reached out to registered dietitians to learn more about the potential perks and drawbacks of AI-generated meal planning, including whether this can be a reliable way to plan your meals in advance. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is meal planning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Meal planning is when you decide in advance what you’re going to eat each week and draft a weekly menu and grocery list. Meal plans can take many different forms, but they’re often personalized to meet nutritional needs, health goals, dietary preferences and budget constraints. It can be a helpful way to stick to a budget, save time, meet nutritional requirements and consolidate your food shopping into one trip. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You can create your own meal plan, use an app or hire a professional, such as a registered dietitian. Now, some people are also using AI.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it actually a good idea to use AI for meal planning? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;AI can be a cost-effective and helpful starting point for people who are interested in incorporating meal planning and preparation in their routine, said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.thedietitiandish.com/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Patricia Kolesa" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a482dfe4b0c2c76f8502a1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.thedietitiandish.com/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Patricia Kolesa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a registered dietitian and founder of Dietitian Dish. “It provides a framework and structure for regular meal intake and incorporating certain foods or food groups into the diet that might have not been present before,” Kolesa said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: carlofranco via Getty Images"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;carlofranco via Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;Meal plans can help simplify your week, providing you with grocery lists, meal ideas and recipes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But she says AI probably shouldn’t be the only tool you use.

A meal plan does not take these factors into consideration the way a dietitian or nutrition professional will.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;To help you better understand the nuances — including the importance of human judgment in meal planning — here are some of the perks and drawbacks of AI-generated meal plans, as explained by registered dietitians.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits Of Using AI For Meal Planning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;AI-based meal planning can be quick, cost-effective, and simple. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;AI makes meal planning way more accessible, including among people who don’t have access to a registered dietitian. “What was once only available through a dietitian or a paid membership program is now available to more people, often for free,” said &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://the-concierge-dietitian.com/home/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Violeta Morris" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a482dfe4b0c2c76f8502a1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://the-concierge-dietitian.com/home/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Violeta Morris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a registered dietitian at the Concierge Dietitian.

In some cases, this means you could see a lot of repetition in recommended foods and meals, “which can lead to burnout and stopping your plan entirely,” Kolesa said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And if you have a health condition, a generic, AI-generated meal plan might not meet certain nutrient requirements or health goals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“AI can provide general guidance, but it can’t offer the personalized, clinical recommendations needed — especially for individuals with medical conditions like diabetes or hypertension,” Morris said. “These individuals have specific nutrient targets and require a level of understanding, context and human connection that only a dietitian or healthcare provider can provide.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s A Tricky Learning Curve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Learning how to properly leverage AI for meal planning, such as understanding what details to include in your prompts, can be challenging. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You need to know how to ask the right prompts or it might not give you the best plan,” Crum said. “You have to tell it if you have allergies, foods you don’t like, or how many calories you need. If you don’t give clear info, the plan might not work for you.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It Can Be Restrictive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An AI-generated meal plan may be too restrictive and promote disordered eating behaviors without the user realizing it, Kolesa said.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;“Depending on how the user inputs information, the meal plan may remove certain food groups or lack the necessary nutrients to meet daily needs,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And if you don’t know how many calories your body needs, AI-generated recommendations could amount to more or less than you need. “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A dietitian can help figure out how much food and what kind of nutrients you need based on your weight, height, activity level, and health goals,” Crum said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Errors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You’ve likely heard about how &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ai-hallucinations-whats-really-happening_l_68556bd5e4b0278e54ed3d14" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="AI can “hallucinate” " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68a482dfe4b0c2c76f8502a1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="68556bd5e4b0278e54ed3d14" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;AI can “hallucinate” &lt;/a&gt;and offer incorrect information.

Everyone and their mother is telling you to load up on your protein, and we've spent the past decade emphasizing plant-based proteins for health. But now, new research suggests eating animal meat may have some health benefit: It could potentially help lower your risk of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="3" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Confused? You're not alone. The study seemingly contradicts a bunch of other research that suggests that meat isn’t so great for you. (For what it's worth, doctors tend to emphasize a plant-forward diet as the healthiest option.) It's also important to note that this study was funded by the National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA). However, the NCBA was not involved in the study design, data collection and analysis or publication of the findings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="4" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;“When you see data like this from a consumer or patient standpoint, it’s really confusing,” admits &lt;a href="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/jack-f-jacoub" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.memorialcare.org/providers/jack-f-jacoub" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jack Jacoub, MD" data-node-id="4.1" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;Jack Jacoub, MD&lt;/a&gt;, medical director of MemorialCare Cancer Institute at Orange Coast and Saddleback Medical Centers in Orange County, CA.

The &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/diet-physical-activity/acs-guidelines-nutrition-physical-activity-cancer-prevention/guidelines.html" target="_blank" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/diet-physical-activity/acs-guidelines-nutrition-physical-activity-cancer-prevention/guidelines.html" data-vars-ga-ux-element="Hyperlink" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="American Cancer Society " data-node-id="16.5" class="body-link css-7bauu1 emevuu60"&gt;American Cancer Society &lt;/a&gt;(ACS) also suggests eating a plant-forward diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="17" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The category of "animal-based protein" isn’t well-defined in this study, and lumps in things like steak with leaner meats like chicken and fish, Dr. Jacoub notes. “Those have already been linked to a lower prevalence of cancer,” he says. That makes it tricky to tell whether all sources of animal protein may be helpful for cancer risk, or just some. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="does-plant-protein-provide-the-same-benefits" data-node-id="18" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="18.0"&gt;Does plant protein provide the same benefits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="19" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;It's possible. Dr. Egan stresses that the difference between animal and plant proteins’ impact on cancer risk in the study is “very modest” and that animal proteins only had a “marginal” statistical significance. “The weight of evidence suggests there is no meaningful association of dietary protein intake with cancer mortality regardless of protein source,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="20" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Still, Dr. Jacoub says that diet and plant-based diets are a big topic with his cancer patients, and that he tends to give everyone the same advice. “Based on all of the data, one could conclude that you have to limit alcohol, have to try to maintain your body weight through diet and exercise, and that the types of diets that you should be engaging in are probably less focused on red meat and should be focused more on chicken, fish, and vegetables,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="whats-so-special-about-animal-protein-versus-other-types-of-protein" data-node-id="21" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="21.0"&gt;What’s so special about animal protein versus other types of protein?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="22" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt; Animal protein is derived from animal sources like meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy products, Dr. Egan explains. “It is considered a complete protein, meaning it contains all nine essential amino acids that humans need to obtain from their diet for things like muscle repair growth and other bodily functions,” she says. “Plant-based protein is found in foods like legumes, nuts, seeds, whole grains and soy products. Plant proteins are often complete or may be combined to obtain the full spectrum of amino acids.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="23" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;But again, it’s not clear why eating animal proteins may lead to a lower risk of dying from cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-much-animal-protein-should-i-be-eating-a-week-to-reap-the-benefits" data-node-id="24" class="body-h2 css-1eo7s1x emevuu60"&gt;&lt;strong data-node-id="24.0"&gt;How much animal protein should I be eating a week to reap the benefits?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="25" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for total protein is set at 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight a day, Dr. Egan points out. “All available evidence suggests that an emphasis on plant-based protein is optimal for health,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-journey-content="true" data-node-id="26" class="css-i9p093 emevuu60"&gt;Dr. Jacoub stresses that more research is needed, although he recommends leaning more toward animal proteins like chicken and fish over red meat. But, if you really like red meat, he says it’s fine to consume it in moderation. “A little bit of red meat is okay, but the real proven things for lowering cancer risk are high-antioxidant foods like nuts and berries and eating other types of protein,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-journey-blur="partial" data-ad-exclude="true" class="css-19m4yzp e1jy25xv0"&gt;&lt;div class="css-sfzxfp ev8dhu59"&gt;&lt;span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"&gt;&lt;img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ea27d1a6-ecd9-4da8-b2a7-049a03b4ab93_1528214135.file?fill=1:1&amp;amp;resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Korin Miller" title="Headshot of Korin Miller" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="css-o0wq4v ev8dhu53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dsojn8 ev8dhu55"&gt;&lt;p class="css-1y37fga ev8dhu54"&gt;Korin Miller is a freelance writer specializing in general wellness, sexual health and relationships, and lifestyle trends, with work appearing in Men’s Health, Women’s Health, Self, Glamour, and more.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Rietie Venter, expert in microbiology at the University of South Australia and study lead author, said: 'Antibiotic resistance isn't just about antibiotics anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This study is a clear reminder that we need to carefully consider the risks of using multiple medications—particularly in aged care where residents are often prescribed a mix of long-term treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This doesn't mean we should stop using these medications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But we do need to be more mindful about how they interact with antibiotics and that includes looking beyond just two-drug combinations.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the study, published in the journal &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44259-025-00144-w"&gt;Antimicrobials and Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, the scientists looked at the effects of nine types of medications commonly used in care homes alongside E. Coli drug ciprofloxacin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Professor Venter said: 'When bacteria were exposed to ciprofloxacin alongside ibuprofen and acetaminophen, they developed more genetic mutations than with the antibiotic alone, helping them grow faster and become highly resistant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Worryingly, the bacteria were not only resistant to the antibiotic ciprofloxacin, but increased resistance was also observed to multiple other antibiotics from different classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We also uncovered the genetic mechanisms behind this resistance, with ibuprofen and paracetamol both activating the bacteria's defences to expel antibiotics and render them less effective.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Symptoms of Shiga toxin-producing E.coli include severe diarrhoea and vomiting, according to the UK Health Security Agency &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that bacterial antimicrobial resistance was directly responsible for 1.27million global deaths in 2019, and contributed to 4.95million deaths. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers expect this trend to continue in the coming decades, with antimicrobial resistance deaths among people over the age of 70 to more than double. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists are particularly worried about Shiga toxin-producing E.coli (STEC) infections—a rare strain of the diarrhoea causing bug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can cause haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a life-threatening condition that is becoming increasingly difficult to treat, leading to kidney failure, sepsis and eventually death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="art-ins mol-factbox health" data-version="2" id="mol-bd3fdb50-8262-11f0-949f-7946aad766ca" data-permabox-url="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-15034579/painkiller-deadly-risk-paracetamol-ibuprofen-study.html"&gt; &lt;h3 class="mol-factbox-title"&gt;WHAT IS ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE? &lt;/h3&gt; &lt;div class="ins cleared mol-factbox-body"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Antibiotics have been doled out unnecessarily by GPs and hospital staff for decades, fueling once harmless bacteria to become superbugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The World Health Organization (WHO) has previously warned if nothing is done the world is heading for a 'post-antibiotic' era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It claimed common infections, such as chlamydia, will become killers without immediate solutions to the growing crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Bacteria can become drug resistant when people take incorrect doses of antibiotics or if they are given out unnecessarily. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Former chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies claimed in 2016 that the threat of antibiotic resistance is as severe as terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Figures estimate that superbugs will kill 10 million people each year by 2050, with patients succumbing to once harmless bugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around 700,000 people already die yearly due to drug-resistant infections including tuberculosis (TB), HIV and malaria across the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Concerns have repeatedly been raised that medicine will be taken back to the 'dark ages' if antibiotics are rendered ineffective in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Without antibiotics, C-sections, cancer treatments and hip replacements will become incredibly 'risky', it was said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Today, after years of escalating attacks, that consensus has irrevocably shattered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The rupture has centered around, what else, the Covid vaccines. Yesterday, a British cardiologist allied with US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trump-and-robert-f-kennedy-junior-to-ban-covid-19-vaccine-within-months/"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the Daily Beast that the Trump administration would soon pull Covid-19 vaccines off the market. Last week, the American Academy of Pediatrics &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/leading-pediatrics-group-recommends-covid-19-shots-for-young-children-differing-from-cdc-5ed971a6?mod=djemHL_t"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that the group would continue to recommend Covid vaccines for kids under the age of 2 — openly defying Kennedy’s &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/05/27/covid-shots-pregnant-women-children-recommendation-change-hhs-secretary-kennedy/"&gt;move&lt;/a&gt; this May to end the recommendation for both healthy children and pregnant people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology followed suit, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-22/ob-gyns-clash-with-rfk-jr-to-back-covid-shots-during-pregnancy?cmpid=BBD082525_prognosis&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_term=250825&amp;amp;utm_campaign=prognosis&amp;amp;embedded-checkout=true"&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; on Friday that it would also continue to advise pregnant people to get a Covid shot. In both cases, some of the country’s leading medical organizations said they wanted to maintain access to protection for the very youngest children, either directly or through vaccinating their mothers, because of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/whats-new/protecting-infants-and-children-from-covid-19-associated-hospitalization.html"&gt;the evidence&lt;/a&gt; that the population is at a higher risk of serious illness from Covid-19 compared to older children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Kennedy, in response, &lt;a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/pediatrics/vaccines/117132?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20First%20Edition&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9GBECOygD1fmyU5xIQljpeuRFzwnXDVj9HXevA7-1OZ3RduDJVPYJAsBUX-MnSFw2ZoxRzBkKa_sqK-rIOLJKV87DuxA&amp;amp;_hsmi=377385414&amp;amp;utm_content=377385414&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;ominously warned&lt;/a&gt; the physician groups that their members could lose liability protections from medical malpractice lawsuits if they don’t follow the government’s vaccine guidance. In this new reality in which doctors and federal health officials are at odds over who should get vaccines, shots could be harder to get — and not only Covid shots, but flu vaccines and routine childhood shots, all of which have come under Kennedy’s scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;And the divide between the Trump administration and other medical authorities may grow even further soon: A group of New England states is &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/22/metro/vaccine-public-health-massachusetts-pennsylvania-rhode-island-vermont-connecticut-maine-kennedy-trump/?event=event12&amp;amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosvitals&amp;amp;stream=top"&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; this week to discuss whether to issue its own vaccine guidance. Even as scientists develop exciting new applications of the same mRNA technology that helped successfully produce the Covid vaccines as part of &lt;a href="/future-perfect/2023/1/18/23560407/operation-warp-speed-pandemics-vaccines-covid-white-house-biden-trump"&gt;Trump’s “Operation Warp Speed”&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic, Kennedy is canceling mRNA contracts with drug developers. The loss of federal funding for the platform could possibly close off future treatments before they can even be developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;As a result of all this, more people could get sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Drug manufacturers may produce &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-25/rfk-jr-s-real-impact-on-us-vaccine-supply-to-emerge-as-panel-meets?embedded-checkout=true"&gt;fewer doses&lt;/a&gt; of their existing vaccines. Insurers &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other-health/acip-cdc-and-insurance-coverage-of-vaccines-in-the-united-states/"&gt;may not be willing&lt;/a&gt; to cover people’s shots if they are not being recommended by the government. Various nightmare scenarios could emerge: Maybe a vulnerable person gives up on getting a shot, even if it is recommended for them and covered by their insurance, simply because they can’t &lt;em&gt;find&lt;/em&gt; one at a nearby pharmacy. Or maybe the healthy loved one of a vulnerable person won’t be able to afford their shot because their insurance plan won’t cover it anymore. That will leave them to decide between taking the risk to go see their loved one, who could get seriously ill, or not seeing them at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;We are running headlong into a forced experiment, in which the federal government actively obstructs the usage of vaccines and the development of new ones, and &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1056022"&gt;a growing share&lt;/a&gt; of the public has lost their faith in one of modern medicine’s greatest tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p id="the-war-between-the-trump-administration-and-the-medical-community-is-heating-up" class="_7ka5u1 _7ka5u0 duet--article--standard-heading xkp0cg1"&gt;&lt;h2 class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup"&gt;The war between the Trump administration and the medical community is heating up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;That the federal government and professional medical societies would be openly at war over vaccine guidance in this way really was once unimaginable. Around the turn of the century, more than 90 percent of Americans &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648308/far-fewer-regard-childhood-vaccinations-important.aspx"&gt;agreed&lt;/a&gt; that childhood immunizations were important. After years of federal advocacy and government coordination with doctors, the United States had successfully &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html"&gt;eradicated&lt;/a&gt; measles as of 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;But in 2025, less than 70 percent of Americans still &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/648308/far-fewer-regard-childhood-vaccinations-important.aspx"&gt;believe&lt;/a&gt; that childhood vaccinations are “very important.” This year, the US saw &lt;a href="/vaccines/411756/us-measles-outbreak-cases-deaths-charts"&gt;its worst measles outbreak&lt;/a&gt; since the early 1990s, and Kennedy’s health department was, &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/texas-measles-outbreak-cdc-vaccines-rfk-trump/"&gt;based on reporting&lt;/a&gt; by KFF Health News, reluctant to help, while he made public statements &lt;a href="/health/401130/texas-new-mexico-measles-rfk-hhs-response"&gt;waffling&lt;/a&gt; on the value of vaccines — even though the measles vaccine is 97 percent effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;Well, for starters, even though anti-vaccine activism has existed for decades, the movement received a boost with the COVID-19 pandemic and the way &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2790248"&gt;it polarized people’s opinions&lt;/a&gt; about public health experts. It edged further into the mainstream with Kennedy’s presidential campaign promising to “Make America Healthy Again” — a movement that has found &lt;a href="/health/421349/trump-rfk-jr-maha-movement-epa-health"&gt;an uneasy home&lt;/a&gt; within the Trump administration. After Trump’s election, he nominated Kennedy to be US health secretary and, once confirmed, Kennedy quickly started rolling back the federal government’s support for vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="duet--article--article-body-component"&gt;&lt;p class="duet--article--dangerously-set-cms-markup duet--article--standard-paragraph _1agbrixi lg8ac51 lg8ac50 xkp0cg1"&gt;In the first few months on the job, he &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/health/healthcare/vaccine-opponent-hired-by-rfk-jr-scours-official-records-for-link-to-autism-a1091eb4?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20First%20Edition&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_goqS6BuIyd4jwcvUhO4YmiNe6Tl5q-I3GZjHxmZ74tTJTxdSWDx4fJQ-0zWbnwrluvqD-3IQ0yq-XRLnjILrSLQWbfA&amp;amp;_hsmi=365387600&amp;amp;utm_content=365387600&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;put a vaccine skeptic in charge&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="/health/414740/rfk-jr-autism-kids-causes-diagnosis-meaning"&gt;searching for a link&lt;/a&gt; between vaccines and autism.

He &lt;a href="/health/416304/rfk-jr-cdc-vaccine-experts-fired"&gt;replaced the federal government’s expert vaccine panel&lt;/a&gt; with his own handpicked members. He has ordered &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/25/nx-s1-5445254/cdc-review-vaccine-schedule-children"&gt;a review of the childhood immunization schedule&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/22/health/covid-vaccines-rfk.html?utm_campaign=KHN%3A%20First%20Edition&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9MriQRO5-VQczar56iAzswhoi_Q03T6vIoP7evQOWLBTa4GgAy4ma9HWjzqAHaFwOoDRKi6Tj_A6h84Nlu4wbpS1smYQ&amp;amp;_hsmi=377385414&amp;amp;utm_content=377385414&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;the safety of Covid shots&lt;/a&gt;.

            &lt;em&gt;Nearly impossible to measure, quantify, convey, pain is a truly mysterious human sensation. For the last 25 years in my life as a neurosurgeon, I have seen a lot of pain and suffering firsthand, so much of it chronic, persistent and difficult to treat. That is why I spent the past three years digging deep into the complexities of pain, its relationship to the brain and strategies to combat it that you have probably never considered. For most of us, pain will be a reality at some point in our lives, but I am more convinced than ever that “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/It-Doesnt-Have-to-Hurt/Sanjay-Gupta/9781668014479" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It Doesn’t Have to Hurt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,” which is the title of my new book, releasing on September 2. I am delighted to share a selection below. Then, on September 7, watch CNN at 8 p.m. ET to witness incredible cutting-edge innovations in pain relief in my new documentary, “Dr. Sanjay Gupta Reports: It Doesn’t Have to Hurt.” - Sanjay&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            When headaches or sore muscles strike us at home, we reach for everyday painkillers. Usually it’s something like ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen, all analgesics known in the medical world as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs). The most common non-NSAID pain reliever is acetaminophen, or Tylenol, which isn’t an anti-inflammatory but works well to reduce fever and is typically easier on the stomach. Even before reaching for those over-the-counter meds, we may ice a sore elbow or lower back, or soak in a hot tub to ease achy muscles or joints.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In the clinical setting, we certainly appreciate it when the dentist numbs our mouth with Novocain. We take anesthesia for granted when rolling into surgery (having had an IV sedative first), or receiving an epidural during childbirth — as my wife did for all three of our girls. Then, of course, there are post-op meds — including, when necessary, prescription opioids to manage acute pain through recovery. In all these ways, we’ve become accustomed to pain relief being an “outside job.” But in truth, elaborate biochemical systems, molecular mechanisms, and mind-body networks for pain control and prevention already exist within us, an “inside job” that science is only beginning to unpack.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen55ilt00033b6q9hyfkewb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mind, body, brain, bones, and blood: every part of us is wired not only for pain but also for pain relief. It’s an incredible system that gets little attention, one I first experienced all those years ago while lying impaled on that spiked fence. Even before I went to the ER or received any medications, I could feel my body starting to soothe itself, my own healing mechanisms taking over. The pain didn’t disappear, but it came in waves, with periods of real relief in between. And then, simply having my mother arrive provided not just mental and emotional comfort but actual physical comfort too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen564j100063b6qmsi8smh5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Having a caring person in your life can improve your resilience to pain, whereas isolation or loneliness can exacerbate it. I remember the first time one of my children got a shot. I didn’t even have to think about what to do: my first instinct was to comfort her with voice and touch.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen56aif00093b6q5jxwz9ll@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sometimes when we’re sidelined with a painful injury, a call from a friend or even just listening to music can make a difference in how we feel by flooding the brain’s pain-processing circuitry with positive feelings and emotions. Training your brain in this way is a crucial piece of the healing mix for pain relief.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen564j100073b6qqqxkughm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Think of this healing mix as an expanded toolbox that goes beyond what most people consider the “real” tools for pain relief. The conventional conversation tends to focus on medications and medical interventions, but I want to bring your attention to other, less appreciated tools. Let’s start with your body’s built-in painkillers, the endogenous opioid system.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmen57d1h000b3b6qf5148ho5@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="your-bodys-natural-painkillers-endogenous-opioids-placebos-and-more" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Your body’s natural painkillers: Endogenous opioids, placebos, and more
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen55g9e00003b6qafh0k10p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By now you know that opiates are some of the world’s most powerful painkillers. But what you may not know is that your body is adept at producing the natural form of these same chemicals. They’re called endorphins, a term that merges the Greek word &lt;em&gt;endogenous &lt;/em&gt;(meaning “from within”) and &lt;em&gt;morphine&lt;/em&gt;. Though endorphins are just one of several types of protein molecules with this painkiller quality, the word is often used to refer to them collectively. And as you’re about to learn, they can influence your mood as well as your perception of pain. Pump up the endorphins — decrease the pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen581ez000e3b6qpugxgrim@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The natural world serves as both an inspiration and a guide as scientists search for ways to tap into or mimic its unique problem-solving genius. A bird in flight, the strength of a spider’s web, a gecko’s sticky grip — all have served as models for scientific inventions. Bioinspired innovations are all around us, from skyscrapers to syringes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen58kxm000j3b6qq3z6ho15@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many years ago, when drug developers began to search for molecules and mechanisms that could safely reduce pain, they drew inspiration from our own human bodies and their endogenous opioid system. Keep in mind that in addition to reducing pain, the system is involved in emotional regulation and mood, neurogenesis (growth of new neurons in the nervous system), neuroplasticity, learning and memory, and the brain’s reward- processing system.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen58kxm000k3b6q7q0z4j35@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So how does it work? Opioids, whether endogenous or those found in narcotics (called exogenous opioids), bind to opioid receptors located on the outer membrane of nerve cells in the brain, spinal cord, and other organs. Like molecular keys in locks, when opioids bind to these receptors, they trigger a cascade of chemical changes within and between neurons, producing feelings of pleasure as well as pain relief.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen58kxm000l3b6qjvw54i94@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The receptors are also present in the brain’s reward circuitry, which uses the neurotransmitter dopamine to tag experiences of pleasure. That is why we often want to repeat certain experiences. That’s true of all opioids. But endogenous opioids have an insider advantage as a natural part of the body’s interwoven system for pain modulation. Like software programs that are part of the same operating system, they mesh seamlessly. Evolution has fine-tuned their actions with meticulous precision, including the way the body metabolizes them so they can constantly turn on or off, as well as micromanaging doses. This prevents some of the complications that arise with outside opioid medications, including constipation, brain fog, slowed breathing, nausea, and drug tolerance and dependence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen58kxm000m3b6qptu1mjkf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nature even added an emergency survival tool: stress-induced analgesia that temporarily suppresses pain. Under extreme stress, the fight-or-flight hormones aggressively trigger the endogenous opioid system, which greatly reduces the pain. The pain does eventually come back when this emergency hormonal response subsides, but in the meantime, traumatic injuries may not immediately register as painful to a wounded soldier or a kid impaled by a fence. “When you look at the release of norepinephrine and opioids for the flight and fear response — it is one of the most potent analgesic, anti-pain molecules that exists,” says Daniela Salvemini, Ph.D., William Beaumont Professor and director of St. Louis University Institute for Translational Neuroscience. Having devoted her career to understanding the mechanisms that drive neuropathic pain, and the molecules that may relieve it, she remains in awe of “what our bodies have given us as survival kits.” For some, it kicks in right away, and for others, it takes considerably longer, but everyone appears to have this naturally occurring plan B for the most dire circumstances.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen595rt000o3b6q0rgjmtm5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A variety of stressors, not just physical pain, can trigger the endogenous opioid system. These include psychological, neurological, physiological, even ontological (spiritual or metaphysical) factors, which can activate the system to:
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen58jlt000h3b6qrhq3938d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Because most of these endogenous opioid benefits take place at a subconscious level, these processes have long been assumed to be inaccessible, meaning not something you can control in the same way you can pop a pill. But now we know that simply moving — jogging or going for a brisk walk — can trigger an endorphin release that delivers the rush we call an endorphin high, or “runner’s high.” Gazing at a sunset or a loved one can help do it as well. You can activate your own endogenous opioid system and experience the surprising power of your neural circuits to disrupt pain &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;amplify pleasure. We now know that just by choosing to focus on something beautiful or positive, a wondrous cascade of events unfolds in our bodies that can change our experience of pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmera7y9m00003b6nkkfboyw3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Let’s take a closer look at the term &lt;em&gt;placebo effect&lt;/em&gt;, which many think of as a fake pill or sham treatment used in clinical research to compare effects with the “real” treatment being studied. Researchers typically compare the two, because any health improvements from a new or experimental medication must outperform the placebo by a measurable amount before being deemed worthy of taking forward.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerawzvn00093b6no5mmv7zk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recognizing a placebo’s intrinsic value as something that can improve pain, however, scientists are now investigating the placebo effect on the endogenous opioid system. This makes sense because we know cognitive factors — our thoughts, beliefs, and expectations — can affect our physical and emotional well-being by activating the endogenous opioid system. We also recognize that the effect of any treatment, placebo or “real,” may be affected by the meaning we attach to it, in addition to the physical property of the treatment itself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerawzvn000a3b6nk25vqtyg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two important findings about placebos have become clearer over time. First, there is no single placebo effect; placebo effects are influenced by a multitude of factors at any given time, including expectations (positive or negative) about treatment. Second, these expectations, while intangible, are the product of subjective and physiological experiences that are wired into the brain’s pain-processing circuitry and can be modified over time. This means that far from just being a sham treatment, placebo is a legitimate tool in your pain toolbox.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerawy8z00073b6ncs72aba7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now let’s turn to the external tools. Keep in mind that these can change, or how we use them can change, as scientific understanding evolves. Here’s a simple example that involves a routine home remedy so common and widely accepted, you’ll be surprised to learn that it’s been at the center of a simmering debate for nearly fifty years — and counting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerayi8o000h3b6n1csmi2q4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You’ve probably heard of RICE — rest, ice, compression, and elevation — and may have even used it to treat a sprain, strained muscle, or painful bruise. For as long as I can remember, RICE was the recommended first response for treating acute tissue injury.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerayi8o000i3b6nsc4etexe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The concept of RICE dates back to 1978, when a sports medicine physician named Gabe Mirkin coined the term, which coaches and health care providers quickly adopted. At the time, conventional wisdom was that reducing inflammation, along with resting, would reduce pain and hasten healing. Slightly elevating an injury to decrease blood flow and applying gentle pressure presented no red flags medically, so the RICE treatment grew in popularity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerayi8o000j3b6nnl5079qu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whenever I had a mild injury, I used these steps too without ever giving it much thought. Recently, though, amid a flourishing debate, some newer candidates include PEACE (protect, elevate, avoid anti- inflammatories, compress, and educate); LOVE (load, optimism, vascu- larization, and exercise); and POLICE (protection, optimal loading, ice, compression, and elevation). Without going into all the differences — from vascularization (blood vessel formation) to gauging the proper load for an injured muscle — I’d just point out that the expanding conversation reflects that focus on tweaking health and medical approaches as new scientific findings emerge. What I see as most compelling is a loose but well-reasoned growing consensus that suggests the better option is to replace RICE with MEAT, which stands for movement, exercise, analgesia, and treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerayi8o000k3b6nlszz9p1a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s why. The downside of RICE is that it tamps down inflammation.&lt;br&gt;As you’ve read in previous chapters, some level of inflammation is necessary to activate healing processes and reduce the chance of developing chronic pain. While dialing down inflammation may initially ease pain, it also can delay or inhibit long-term tissue healing. The lesson is a critically important one when it comes to pain: let the body take care of itself as naturally as possible. Given what we now know, unless you have a fractured bone or can’t bear weight, RICE should no longer be the blanket recommendation for pain management.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeraysou000m3b6nxmc9re54@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead, the emphasis is now on these four steps:
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeray2p8000f3b6nd8y1woze@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Movement: &lt;/strong&gt;Mild movement or exercise improves blood flow and circula- tion of healing agents to the injured area. It stimulates muscle, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and other tissue, whereas stagnation can stall healing and lead to continuing pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeraz3bh000p3b6nw1c3m3nh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Exercise: &lt;/strong&gt;This component is meant to kick in once the pain has lessened.&lt;br&gt;For a muscle injury, this would involve gentle moves designed to slowly restore function and flexibility. For other types of bruised or swollen soft tissue, for example, from surgery or trauma, mild exercise further improves circulation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerazj20000s3b6n9d59rzgd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Analgesia: &lt;/strong&gt;Cautious use of pain relievers if necessary, as well as the use of natural options such as turmeric or capsaicin instead of anti-inflammatories, which may inhibit healing for the reasons already described. Also consider topical anesthetics and analgesic patches, or mild transcutaneous neurostimulation such as the TENS device, which applies a low-voltage current to the skin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerazxfc000v3b6nvxsazm6p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Treatment:&lt;/strong&gt; The final component of MEAT refers to the range of tailored early treatment through various therapeutic approaches. These might include physical therapy, massage, acupuncture or other “dry needling” (solid needles containing no medication), myofascial release (and other techniques using targeted massage to release tension in a specific muscle area), joint mobilization (to improve range of motion), as well as use of ice and heat.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb0cbj000y3b6nvec3e2si@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Heat and cold therapy both can help relieve pain, though they work in different ways and are best for different situations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb0skl00113b6nh7oswhic@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cold therapy is best for short-term pain, applied within the first seventy-two hours to counter swelling. Keep in mind that while cold temperature slows blood flow, which can help reduce pain from sprains, strains, and other acute injuries, it may also decrease inflammation, slow healing, and increase the likelihood of chronic pain. Regular cold-water plunges have gained a popular following in recent years, and some studies suggest that regular cold exposure through ice bathing or plunges may ease discomfort after intense workouts and help with stress regulation. These may not be the best options, however, for treating an injury. The practice continues to be the subject of debate because it may also carry risks for some people — in particular those with cardiovascular issues. The concern is something known as a cold shock response, which can lead to an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. Some may also hyperventilate, which can lead to fainting as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb1i0f00163b6n0hzkm4dv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Heat therapy is best for long-standing muscle pain, stiffness, and chronic pain conditions. Because it boosts blood flow, which can help relax muscles and ease aching joints, heat therapy is often recommended before exercise or stretching or to ease morning stiffness. Applying low-level heat for a longer period, such as with heat wraps you can buy at the drugstore, may reduce stiffness and tension and increase flexibility. Just be sure to follow product directions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb1i0f00173b6num9cm5z0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Either way, don’t overdo it. When using a hot or cold pack, wrap it in a thin towel to protect your skin and apply it for no more than ten to twenty minutes to avoid skin damage. You can do this several times a day, but be sure to take breaks in between to let your skin and tissue recover. And stop using heat or cold therapy immediately if it worsens your pain or discomfort or if your skin reacts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb1i0f00183b6ns8ydt47l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Neither MEAT nor RICE is all wrong or always right. But with a basic understanding of these points of difference, you’re better equipped to eval- uate your options. The bottom line is that a desire for a quick fix may slow your overall healing process; as a general rule, be conservative with initial interventions like these and pay attention to the way your body responds; let the body heal itself and intervene only when necessary.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Renewed urgency about extended use of aspirin and NSAIDs
&lt;/h4&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb1gjo00143b6nnv7xgd79@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now let’s return to your home medicine cabinet and the nonprescription painkillers you probably keep on hand. If your everyday go-to for pain relief is aspirin or another NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug), it’s time to take a fresh look at how you use it. We now have not just new information, but continued findings over time, that have renewed urgency about the serious risks NSAIDs present for some people, as well as the adverse effects of taking too much or taking them for too long.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb3xcv001i3b6njtzr2xgs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            NSAIDs provide predictable relief for so many routine aches and pains — arthritis flare-ups, headaches, fever, menstrual cramps, colds, flu — that it’s easy to lose track of how often you’re using them and how much you’re taking, and overlook their potential for toxic or other adverse effects. And because these drugs are sold over the counter, it often means you’re making a decision about medication without your physician’s guidance on how to avoid potential problems based on health conditions you may have or medications you may be taking. Keep in mind that these nonprescription medications were mostly intended for short-term use, so relying on them long term might put you at risk for complications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb3xcv001j3b6nbtn85whq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aspirin is a good example. For decades, aspirin has been used for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which is heart disease from plaque buildup in the arteries. In light of recent trial data, however, that practice is now controversial. The &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/aspirin-heart-older-adults-recommendations-wellness"&gt;risk of bleeding&lt;/a&gt; might simply be too high to justify the benefits of preventing heart disease in someone who’s otherwise healthy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb3xcv001k3b6n20nrx3gr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That is why in 2022, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended that people over sixty years old should not take aspirin to pre- vent primary heart disease. Even for those aged forty to forty-nine who may have a lower bleeding risk, the benefit is still thought to be small. If you’ve already had heart problems or have a strong family history and no evidence of bleeding problems, your doctor may recommend a daily baby aspirin. But in general, many doctors have moved away from the practice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Supplements: Considerations, caution, and careful use
&lt;/h4&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb3w38001g3b6nut1f07b9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People are turning increasingly to dietary supplements, seeking out substances they perceive as natural. Unfortunately, because there are very few good, randomized trials, it’s hard to find solid evidence of the benefits of this approach. Additionally, many of these “natural” supplements are unregulated, meaning there’s no guarantee that they’re safe or consistent. There may also be interactions with prescription medications you’re using or other health conditions the supplement could adversely affect. Still, even given the above caveats, I will name a few that are worth considering:
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb5l2s001s3b6nu21z5hpa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Coenzyme Q10 or C0Q10. &lt;/strong&gt;There is evidence that this coenzyme can improve mitochondrial function within cells and also act as an anti- inflammatory. Given the way it works, it may be most beneficial when taken after intense activity or with the use of statin drugs — both of which can be associated with muscle aches. It may also effectively lower blood pressure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb6shq001x3b6np6gr07mp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Magnesium. &lt;/strong&gt;Evidence exists that this simple mineral, which is found in all our bones, can help with pain, particularly in the lower back. By blocking calcium from entering cells, magnesium may reduce the excitability of your muscles, allowing them to relax and reduce spasm, especially after exercise.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Turmeric. &lt;/strong&gt;Growing up in an Indian household, I’ve been eating turmeric since I was a kid. The active ingredient, curcumin, is thought to be a potent anti-inflammatory, particularly effective for osteoarthritis of the knees. Recently it has been recommended to help reduce the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. In recent lab experiments, however, turmeric  inhibited some chemotherapy drugs from working against breast cancer cells and also increased the risk of kidney stones, so make sure to check with your doctor if there is a concern. And buy from a reputable source.&lt;br&gt;Turmeric is among spices that have recently been flagged as potentially being contaminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;Willow bark. &lt;/strong&gt;The active ingredient in willow bark is salicin, which is very similar to aspirin. It is broken down into salicylic acid, which helps decrease pain and fever, and like aspirin may have side effects such as upset stomach and bleeding problems. If you’re sensitive to aspirin, have kidney disease, or you’re taking a blood thinner (or planning surgery) check with your doctor.

            As you consider these or any of the many other options for pain relief we’re about to explore, keep this in mind: pain relief isn’t just about physical relief; it is an integral part of a complex, dynamic healing process that involves every other system in your body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerbiwuk002d3b6n7dd7wbnh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One reason opiates have proven so destructive, especially when used as ongoing treatment for chronic pain, is that over time they corrupt those natural systems. In exchange for initial pain relief, they slowly disable processes essential for normal functioning and healing, and they can create new complications: constipation, nausea, slowed breathing, dizziness, depression, brain fog, and the obvious — dependence and addiction. All of these compromise healing and health, often prolong pain, and carry even greater health risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerbiv4s002b3b6nsprv5629@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            We’ve seen remarkable progress in pain management since the days when opioids and steroids were used to treat most pain maladies. For neuropathic pain, that shooting or burning sensation, we now have drugs such as gabapentin, a prescription medication originally developed as an anticonvulsant, which regulates how pain messages travel from the brain through the spinal cord and reduces the excitability of nerve cells in the brain. “Gaba” (sold under the brand names Horizint, Grayliese, and Neurontin) was approved for treatment of neuropathic pain about twenty years ago, but it is far from a perfect drug. A 2017 review concluded that while around half of those treated had objective pain relief, they also often experienced adverse effects such as dizziness, drowsiness, tiredness, headache, nausea and vomiting, memory loss, weight gain, coordination problems, and eye problems. The drug worked best for postherpetic neuralgia; evidence for other types of neuropathic pain was very limited.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerbkht8002k3b6n6io6yxwc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            We’ve also seen an uptick of interest in the use of antidepressants for pain, especially for chronic migraines and long-standing arthritic pain. It’s not entirely clear yet why they help relieve pain for some people. The fact that they increase serotonin, which can improve mood, might be one reason. It may also be that they affect the &lt;em&gt;perception &lt;/em&gt;of pain, reducing the focus the person puts on it and thereby distracting them from it. What is clear is that these medications take a long time to work, sometimes up to several weeks, and even then, the patient may need regular dosage adjustments to minimize side effects. A 2021 systematic meta-review of thirty-three trials showed that serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) reduced back pain with moderate certainty, osteoarthritis pain with low certainty, and sciatica with very low certainty on pain and disability scores.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerbkht8002l3b6n0bqp7idc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A 2023 Cochrane network meta-analysis examining antidepressants across all chronic pain conditions concluded that after investigating twenty- five different antidepressants, “the only antidepressant we are certain about for the treatment of chronic pain is duloxetine. Duloxetine was moderately efficacious across all outcomes at standard dose.” There is also promising evidence for milnacipran, the study said, but higher-quality research is needed. “Evidence for all other antidepressants was low certainty.” Additionally, after randomized controlled trials excluded people with low mood, the review was unable to establish any beneficial effects of antidepressants for people with chronic pain. The review concluded that currently there is “no reliable evidence for the long-term efficacy of any anti-depressant.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerbl6ig002n3b6n3ju627oc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In people who suffer chronic pain, there’s emerging evidence that their sensory neurons are more excitable than usual and can therefore be more easily triggered. For that reason, there’s new interest in the use of sodium channel blockers, an established tool for quieting seizures, which are also caused by overexcited nerve cells in the brain. Novocaine, which dentists inject into the tissue they want to numb for a procedure, is one example of a sodium channel blocker. The goal has been to turn that into a pill that works for chronic pain conditions, and researchers are currently making progress on that front.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerbl6ig002o3b6nrtlrej9g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Just this year, the FDA approved the first &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/30/health/fda-approves-painkiller-suzetrigine-journavx"&gt;new drug&lt;/a&gt; in a new class of non-opioid pain medicines, approved to treat moderate to severe acute pain in adults. The approval of Journavx (suzetrigine) marked the first approval of a new class of non-opioid pain relievers in more than two decades. While opioids primarily work by dulling sensations in the brain, the new drug, in fifty milligram oral tablets, is reported to reduce pain by targeting a pain-signaling pathway involving a specific sodium channel in the peripheral nervous system, before the pain signals reach the brain.&lt;br&gt;The efficacy of Journavx was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of acute surgical pain, one following abdominoplasty and the other following bunionectomy. In addition to receiving the randomized treatment, all participants in the trials with inadequate pain control were permitted to use ibuprofen as needed as a “rescue” pain medication. Both trials demonstrated a statistically significant superior reduction in pain with Journavx compared to placebo, the FDA said in announcing the approval.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The discovery of this drug has a fascinating backstory. Nearly twenty-five years ago, researchers learned about a family of fire walkers in Pakistan. They could walk on hot coals without flinching. Importantly, they felt the coals on their feet and even knew they were hot, but it was the specific sensation of pain they weren’t feeling. It wasn’t that their feet were numb, given that the nerves responsible for heat and touch seemed unaffected. Rather it was just the pain-conducting nerves that were affected. That observation led to a quarter-century investigation, the identification of a gene unique to this family, and ultimately helped inspire the development of the new medication.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul data-editable="items" class="factbox__items factbox__items--ul"&gt;
      &lt;li data-editable="items.0.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prescription pain medicines&lt;/strong&gt;, including opioids﻿. These provide stronger pain relief than nonprescriptive options, but because they have potential for abuse and unpleasant and potentially serious side effects, they should be reserved for more severe types of pain.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li data-editable="items.1.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prescription drugs approved for other conditions&lt;/strong&gt; but repurposed “off-label” for pain. These include antidepressants and anticonvulsants.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li data-editable="items.2.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuromodulation&lt;/strong&gt;, including spinal cord stimulation (SCS), an implanted device that sends low levels of electricity directly into the spinal cord to relieve pain; deep brain stimulation (DBS); and local (external) electrical stimulation, applying brief pulses of electricity to nerve endings under the skin to provide pain relief (Scrambler, TENS).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li data-editable="items.3.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Injection therapies&lt;/strong&gt;, including: &lt;strong&gt;Epidural steroid injections&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Nerve blocks&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Joint injections&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Trigger point injections&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Dry needling&lt;/strong&gt;: Usually as part of a larger pain management plan, dry needling is sometimes recommended. The treatment, which can be initially painful, involves placing thin sharp needles through the skin and into what are known as “trigger points,” areas of muscle that have become knotted and tender. The needling can decrease tightness, improve blood flow, and reduce pain. It’s called “dry” because there are no medications in the needle, as with trigger point injections. &lt;strong&gt;Botox&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Gel injections&lt;/strong&gt; (hyaluronic acid to mimic cushioning fluid in joints): often used for knee pain, especially mild to moderate arthritis. &lt;strong&gt;Prolotherapy injections&lt;/strong&gt; (concentrated sugar water to relieve pain in joints, ligaments, and tendons); &lt;strong&gt;Regenerative medicine&lt;/strong&gt; (orthobiologics): a newer category including injectables made from your own blood or tissue, or application of dressings using biomaterials (such as placenta), used to restore tissue in skin grafts and other wound or surgical sites. &lt;strong&gt;Platelet-rich plasma injections and cell therapy&lt;/strong&gt;: PRP injections involve taking the patient’s blood, isolating and concentrating the platelets, and injecting billions of them into the joint, ligament, or tendon. Some newer injectables, called cell therapies, collect cells and tissues from bone marrow or fat tissue. The cells are collected, cleansed, and injected into the patient’s joint, ligament, or tendon.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li data-editable="items.4.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Others&lt;/strong&gt;﻿, including: &lt;strong&gt;Nitrous oxide&lt;/strong&gt; (laughing gas); &lt;strong&gt;Radiofrequency ablation&lt;/strong&gt;, which treats spine pain by using radio waves to heat and destroy nerve tissue, preventing the associated pain signals from reaching the brain. There’s also pulsed electromagnetic wave therapy, a noninvasive FDA-approved treatment that uses magnetic field pulses to improve blood flow to a localized area of pain, such as that from rheumatoid arthritis. &lt;strong&gt;Transcranial magnetic stimulation&lt;/strong&gt; (TMS) is performed by placing a coil on the head to send magnetic pulses that can change the brain’s activity in areas associated with pain. A recent trial showed that the treatment, typically daily sessions for four to six weeks, results in about half of fibromyalgia patients experiencing a meaningful reduction in pain. &lt;strong&gt;Extracorporeal shock wave therapy&lt;/strong&gt;: Think of it as using high-energy sound waves through the skin right on top of the painful area. This type of therapy seems to trigger the body’s natural healing mechanisms, break down scar tissue, and stimulate the formation of new blood vessels.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li data-editable="items.5.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surgery&lt;/strong&gt;. This can effectively relieve some kinds of pain, primarily that caused by structural issues. Most pain is not caused by structural issues, however, and in those cases, an operation not only won’t resolve the pain, it may even make things worse.&lt;/li&gt;

L.A. County also has reported a small increase in patients hospitalized with COVID. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There is a lot of COVID out there,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease expert at UC San Francisco. “COVID is coming a little bit later than last year.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rate at which COVID lab tests came back positive in &lt;a class="link" href="https://ph.lacounty.gov/acd/respwatch/" target="_blank"&gt;L.A. County&lt;/a&gt; is 12.6% for the week that ended Aug. 16, up from 7.6% a month earlier. In &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.ochealthinfo.com/respiratoryvirus" target="_blank"&gt;Orange County&lt;/a&gt;, it’s 14.4%, up from 8.1%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We are seeing outpatient cases increase,” said Dr. Elizabeth E. Hudson, the regional physician chief of infectious diseases for Kaiser Permanente Southern California. “With back-to-school season in full swing ... we are expecting to see an uptick in COVID in children over the next few weeks and this is already being seen in some parts of the country.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a class="link" href="https://yourlocalepidemiologistca.substack.com/p/covid-surge-an-emerging-disease-protecting" target="_blank"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; post, Dr. Matt Willis, former public health officer for Marin County, wrote that “California’s in the middle of a COVID-19 wave, and statewide rates are among the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nwss/rv/COVID19-national-data.html" target="_blank"&gt;highest&lt;/a&gt; in the nation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among senior-age residents in Orange County, emergency room visits for COVID-like illness, as well as hospitalizations for COVID, are also on the upswing, said Dr. Christopher Zimmerman, a physician with the Orange County Health Care Agency’s Communicable Disease and Control Division, and Dr. Regina Chinsio-Kwong, the county’s health officer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hudson said the coronavirus subvariant XFG, nicknamed Stratus, accounts for the vast majority of variants seen in wastewater. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is another Omicron subvariant, so previous infections with other Omicron variants may offer some residual protection, but, as we know, that protection is not complete, so you can certainly be reinfected,” Hudson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It does seem that this summer, COVID season has been less intense than last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In L.A. County, for instance, current COVID hospitalizations for the week that ended Aug. 16 are about half the level seen during the same week last year. And in Orange County, emergency room visits related to COVID-like illness are less than half what they were last summer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Last summer’s COVID surge was the largest since 2022, so this year’s surge is more on par with our less-severe summer surges,” Hudson said. “People are definitely getting COVID this summer, but the intensity is much less than in 2024.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise in COVID comes as the Trump administration has delayed the rollout of the updated vaccine for the fall. Last year, the federal government had fully green-lighted the annual reformulation of the vaccine by &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s-t0627-vaccine-recommendations.html" target="_blank"&gt;June&lt;/a&gt;, in time for a rollout that began in September. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, however, the Department of Health and Human Services led by vaccine skeptic Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has in effect delayed the rollout of this fall’s COVID shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Updated COVID-19 vaccines have been delayed this year due to federal policy changes, and we are awaiting [Food and Drug Administration] licensure of this season’s products,” the L.A. County Department of Public Health said in a statement to The Times. “This means availability in September may be later than what people experienced last fall.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;County health officials noted that the FDA could further revise or limit who can get an annual COVID shot — as &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2025-05-20/trump-officials-set-new-requirements-for-covid-vaccines-in-healthy-adults-and-children"&gt;the agency signaled in May&lt;/a&gt; — “though current evidence continues to show that the vaccines are safe and effective across all ages.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Public Health also warned that because the federal government hasn’t made decisions on licensure approvals and recommendations, “availability and timing of specific COVID-19 vaccine products may be more limited and occur on a later schedule.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’re in an unfortunate limbo, created by an administration that’s uncommitted to vaccines, between the slow shutting down of ’24–’25 vaccine availability and access to the ’25–’26 version,” Willis wrote in the Your Local Epidemiologist in California &lt;a class="link" href="https://substack.com/home/post/p-171508787" target="_blank"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong said that the timing of the vaccine rollout is in such flux and he recommends anyone at risk for severe complications from COVID who hasn’t been vaccinated in more than a year to get inoculated now. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People at severe risk for COVID illness include those 65 and older, those who have compromised immune systems, those who are pregnant, and all infants and children age 6 months to 23 months. (Children age 2 to 5 are also at greater risk for complications from COVID compared with older children.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If they haven’t gotten it in a year, just go ahead, maybe, get it now,” Chin-Hong said. “Because also, the vaccine that’s being proposed [for this fall] is relatively the same formula as last year. ... It’s less important to wait.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might also be easier to get the COVID-19 vaccine now ahead of potential changes in federal recommendations and approvals later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chin-Hong called the delay in formulating a COVID vaccine game plan for this fall “just weird,” as “usually in public health, preparation is everything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point in previous summers, health officials typically already would be urging people to make plans to get a fall COVID vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But this time around, “Nobody knows details about who’s going to be eligible, exactly,” Chin-Hong said, except for those age 65 and up and younger people with chronic health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a whole new discussion, like, ‘When is it coming? Who is it going to be eligible for? ... Do kids have to talk to their pediatrician first? Would pharmacists actually allow them to get it? ... Would healthy pregnant people [be able] to get it?” Chin-Hong said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s as if officials are talking about a new vaccine and a new illness, but the COVID-19 vaccine has been around for more than four years, Chin-Hong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the federal government’s treatment of COVID shots is not happening in a vacuum. Kennedy has &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-08-12/rfk-jr-s-cancellation-of-mrna-vaccine-research"&gt;maligned mRNA vaccine&lt;/a&gt; technology — the basis for the most commonly administered COVID shots — and ordered the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-06-16/dismissed-members-of-cdc-vaccine-committee-call-kennedys-actions-destabilizing"&gt;firing&lt;/a&gt; of all 17 experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s influential vaccine advisory committee. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One person who will lead a committee to review the safety of COVID vaccines for the CDC has described the shots as “the most failing medical product in the history of medical products,” the New York Times &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/22/health/covid-vaccines-rfk.html" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 vaccinations &lt;a class="link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2836434" target="_blank"&gt;averted&lt;/a&gt; 2.5 million deaths globally from 2020 to 2024, according to a report published in the journal JAMA Health Forum in July. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine-skeptic leadership of Kennedy over the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the FDA and CDC, has prompted such a split in the medical community that mainstream organizations such as the American Academy of Pediatrics are issuing their own recommendations concerning vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC, for instance, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-05-31/cdc-radically-changes-its-covid-vaccine-recommendations-heres-what-you-need-to-know"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; asked that parents talk with a healthcare provider before getting the COVID vaccine for healthy children. That’s an extra step parents may need to take to get their children vaccinated, and could end up being a “super big barrier” for vaccination, Chin-Hong said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, the CDC recommended everyone 6 months and older get an updated COVID vaccine in the fall. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CDC also recently offered “no guidance” as to whether healthy pregnant women should get the COVID vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, by contrast, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2025/08/acog-releases-updated-maternal-immunization-guidance-covid-influenza-rsv" target="_blank"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; that people “receive an updated COVID-19 vaccine or ‘booster’ at any point during pregnancy, when planning to become pregnant, in the postpartum period, or when lactating.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The COVID-19 vaccines are particularly effective at reducing morbidity from COVID-19 complications in pregnant patients and their infants,” the organization said. “Data also support the benefit of vaccination in reducing pregnancy complications, such as severe maternal morbidity, preterm birth, and stillbirth.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the American Academy of Pediatrics on &lt;a class="link" href="https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article/doi/10.1542/peds.2025-073924/203222/Recommendations-for-COVID-19-Vaccines-in-Infants" target="_blank"&gt;Aug. 19&lt;/a&gt; recommended that infants and children age 6 months to 23 months get the updated COVID vaccine, since they “are at high risk.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group also said that children ages 2 and older should be offered the latest COVID vaccine if their parent or guardian wishes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The COVID vaccine situation is unsettling. ... Differences in guidance from the CDC and other medical professional groups will be challenging for the public,” the Orange County communicable disease control team said. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Los Angeles Times</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiyAFBVV95cUxNRGpRQkNuRm9Ed01oc2VqR3RubUVTSFZ1WXpwWXVGWEE0SGVLZy1ZY1ltLUpBZzUwVnhOcmItS09DajNPbG5zcU1MNkVZekEtVEtyVGNzVGlzXzE4ZVNsclNoTHFVUlliM01PS2MzTURIUkJNb0dqeml4LUZDdjVpTW15MG8xWERZeFBoODlrV1dSSDltMlJrdGEwNE42TW5TY1NORUxtSzI2NHlLUVFyVFBhaGhBb2ZYbnloSlFNZXhMUDdEeXFTUQ</guid></item><item><title>疼痛缓解不仅仅来自药物。Sanjay Gupta博士解释了您身体的天然止痛药- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/08/26/health/sanjay-gupta-pain-book-excerpt</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            &lt;em&gt;Nearly impossible to measure, quantify, convey, pain is a truly mysterious human sensation. For the last 25 years in my life as a neurosurgeon, I have seen a lot of pain and suffering firsthand, so much of it chronic, persistent and difficult to treat. That is why I spent the past three years digging deep into the complexities of pain, its relationship to the brain and strategies to combat it that you have probably never considered. For most of us, pain will be a reality at some point in our lives, but I am more convinced than ever that “&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/It-Doesnt-Have-to-Hurt/Sanjay-Gupta/9781668014479" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;It Doesn’t Have to Hurt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,” which is the title of my new book, releasing on September 2. I am delighted to share a selection below. Then, on September 7, watch CNN at 8 p.m. ET to witness incredible cutting-edge innovations in pain relief in my new documentary, “Dr. Sanjay Gupta Reports: It Doesn’t Have to Hurt.” - Sanjay&lt;/em&gt;

            When headaches or sore muscles strike us at home, we reach for everyday painkillers. Usually it’s something like ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen, all analgesics known in the medical world as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs). The most common non-NSAID pain reliever is acetaminophen, or Tylenol, which isn’t an anti-inflammatory but works well to reduce fever and is typically easier on the stomach. Even before reaching for those over-the-counter meds, we may ice a sore elbow or lower back, or soak in a hot tub to ease achy muscles or joints.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            In the clinical setting, we certainly appreciate it when the dentist numbs our mouth with Novocain. We take anesthesia for granted when rolling into surgery (having had an IV sedative first), or receiving an epidural during childbirth — as my wife did for all three of our girls. Then, of course, there are post-op meds — including, when necessary, prescription opioids to manage acute pain through recovery. In all these ways, we’ve become accustomed to pain relief being an “outside job.” But in truth, elaborate biochemical systems, molecular mechanisms, and mind-body networks for pain control and prevention already exist within us, an “inside job” that science is only beginning to unpack.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen55ilt00033b6q9hyfkewb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Mind, body, brain, bones, and blood: every part of us is wired not only for pain but also for pain relief. It’s an incredible system that gets little attention, one I first experienced all those years ago while lying impaled on that spiked fence. Even before I went to the ER or received any medications, I could feel my body starting to soothe itself, my own healing mechanisms taking over. The pain didn’t disappear, but it came in waves, with periods of real relief in between. And then, simply having my mother arrive provided not just mental and emotional comfort but actual physical comfort too.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen564j100063b6qmsi8smh5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Having a caring person in your life can improve your resilience to pain, whereas isolation or loneliness can exacerbate it. I remember the first time one of my children got a shot. I didn’t even have to think about what to do: my first instinct was to comfort her with voice and touch.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen56aif00093b6q5jxwz9ll@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Sometimes when we’re sidelined with a painful injury, a call from a friend or even just listening to music can make a difference in how we feel by flooding the brain’s pain-processing circuitry with positive feelings and emotions. Training your brain in this way is a crucial piece of the healing mix for pain relief.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen564j100073b6qqqxkughm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Think of this healing mix as an expanded toolbox that goes beyond what most people consider the “real” tools for pain relief. The conventional conversation tends to focus on medications and medical interventions, but I want to bring your attention to other, less appreciated tools. Let’s start with your body’s built-in painkillers, the endogenous opioid system.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader-elevate vossi-subheader vossi-subheader--size-h2" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cmen57d1h000b3b6qf5148ho5@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="your-bodys-natural-painkillers-endogenous-opioids-placebos-and-more" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Your body’s natural painkillers: Endogenous opioids, placebos, and more
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen55g9e00003b6qafh0k10p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            By now you know that opiates are some of the world’s most powerful painkillers. But what you may not know is that your body is adept at producing the natural form of these same chemicals. They’re called endorphins, a term that merges the Greek word &lt;em&gt;endogenous &lt;/em&gt;(meaning “from within”) and &lt;em&gt;morphine&lt;/em&gt;. Though endorphins are just one of several types of protein molecules with this painkiller quality, the word is often used to refer to them collectively. And as you’re about to learn, they can influence your mood as well as your perception of pain. Pump up the endorphins — decrease the pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen581ez000e3b6qpugxgrim@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The natural world serves as both an inspiration and a guide as scientists search for ways to tap into or mimic its unique problem-solving genius. A bird in flight, the strength of a spider’s web, a gecko’s sticky grip — all have served as models for scientific inventions. Bioinspired innovations are all around us, from skyscrapers to syringes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen58kxm000j3b6qq3z6ho15@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many years ago, when drug developers began to search for molecules and mechanisms that could safely reduce pain, they drew inspiration from our own human bodies and their endogenous opioid system. Keep in mind that in addition to reducing pain, the system is involved in emotional regulation and mood, neurogenesis (growth of new neurons in the nervous system), neuroplasticity, learning and memory, and the brain’s reward- processing system.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen58kxm000k3b6q7q0z4j35@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            So how does it work? Opioids, whether endogenous or those found in narcotics (called exogenous opioids), bind to opioid receptors located on the outer membrane of nerve cells in the brain, spinal cord, and other organs. Like molecular keys in locks, when opioids bind to these receptors, they trigger a cascade of chemical changes within and between neurons, producing feelings of pleasure as well as pain relief.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen58kxm000l3b6qjvw54i94@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The receptors are also present in the brain’s reward circuitry, which uses the neurotransmitter dopamine to tag experiences of pleasure. That is why we often want to repeat certain experiences. That’s true of all opioids. But endogenous opioids have an insider advantage as a natural part of the body’s interwoven system for pain modulation. Like software programs that are part of the same operating system, they mesh seamlessly. Evolution has fine-tuned their actions with meticulous precision, including the way the body metabolizes them so they can constantly turn on or off, as well as micromanaging doses. This prevents some of the complications that arise with outside opioid medications, including constipation, brain fog, slowed breathing, nausea, and drug tolerance and dependence.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen58kxm000m3b6qptu1mjkf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Nature even added an emergency survival tool: stress-induced analgesia that temporarily suppresses pain. Under extreme stress, the fight-or-flight hormones aggressively trigger the endogenous opioid system, which greatly reduces the pain. The pain does eventually come back when this emergency hormonal response subsides, but in the meantime, traumatic injuries may not immediately register as painful to a wounded soldier or a kid impaled by a fence. “When you look at the release of norepinephrine and opioids for the flight and fear response — it is one of the most potent analgesic, anti-pain molecules that exists,” says Daniela Salvemini, Ph.D., William Beaumont Professor and director of St. Louis University Institute for Translational Neuroscience. Having devoted her career to understanding the mechanisms that drive neuropathic pain, and the molecules that may relieve it, she remains in awe of “what our bodies have given us as survival kits.” For some, it kicks in right away, and for others, it takes considerably longer, but everyone appears to have this naturally occurring plan B for the most dire circumstances.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmen595rt000o3b6q0rgjmtm5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A variety of stressors, not just physical pain, can trigger the endogenous opioid system. These include psychological, neurological, physiological, even ontological (spiritual or metaphysical) factors, which can activate the system to:
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Because most of these endogenous opioid benefits take place at a subconscious level, these processes have long been assumed to be inaccessible, meaning not something you can control in the same way you can pop a pill. But now we know that simply moving — jogging or going for a brisk walk — can trigger an endorphin release that delivers the rush we call an endorphin high, or “runner’s high.” Gazing at a sunset or a loved one can help do it as well. You can activate your own endogenous opioid system and experience the surprising power of your neural circuits to disrupt pain &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;amplify pleasure. We now know that just by choosing to focus on something beautiful or positive, a wondrous cascade of events unfolds in our bodies that can change our experience of pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;



  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmera7y9m00003b6nkkfboyw3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Let’s take a closer look at the term &lt;em&gt;placebo effect&lt;/em&gt;, which many think of as a fake pill or sham treatment used in clinical research to compare effects with the “real” treatment being studied. Researchers typically compare the two, because any health improvements from a new or experimental medication must outperform the placebo by a measurable amount before being deemed worthy of taking forward.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerawzvn00093b6no5mmv7zk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Recognizing a placebo’s intrinsic value as something that can improve pain, however, scientists are now investigating the placebo effect on the endogenous opioid system. This makes sense because we know cognitive factors — our thoughts, beliefs, and expectations — can affect our physical and emotional well-being by activating the endogenous opioid system. We also recognize that the effect of any treatment, placebo or “real,” may be affected by the meaning we attach to it, in addition to the physical property of the treatment itself.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerawzvn000a3b6nk25vqtyg@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Two important findings about placebos have become clearer over time. First, there is no single placebo effect; placebo effects are influenced by a multitude of factors at any given time, including expectations (positive or negative) about treatment. Second, these expectations, while intangible, are the product of subjective and physiological experiences that are wired into the brain’s pain-processing circuitry and can be modified over time. This means that far from just being a sham treatment, placebo is a legitimate tool in your pain toolbox.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerawy8z00073b6ncs72aba7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now let’s turn to the external tools. Keep in mind that these can change, or how we use them can change, as scientific understanding evolves. Here’s a simple example that involves a routine home remedy so common and widely accepted, you’ll be surprised to learn that it’s been at the center of a simmering debate for nearly fifty years — and counting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerayi8o000h3b6n1csmi2q4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            You’ve probably heard of RICE — rest, ice, compression, and elevation — and may have even used it to treat a sprain, strained muscle, or painful bruise. For as long as I can remember, RICE was the recommended first response for treating acute tissue injury.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerayi8o000i3b6nsc4etexe@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The concept of RICE dates back to 1978, when a sports medicine physician named Gabe Mirkin coined the term, which coaches and health care providers quickly adopted. At the time, conventional wisdom was that reducing inflammation, along with resting, would reduce pain and hasten healing. Slightly elevating an injury to decrease blood flow and applying gentle pressure presented no red flags medically, so the RICE treatment grew in popularity.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerayi8o000j3b6nnl5079qu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Whenever I had a mild injury, I used these steps too without ever giving it much thought. Recently, though, amid a flourishing debate, some newer candidates include PEACE (protect, elevate, avoid anti- inflammatories, compress, and educate); LOVE (load, optimism, vascu- larization, and exercise); and POLICE (protection, optimal loading, ice, compression, and elevation). Without going into all the differences — from vascularization (blood vessel formation) to gauging the proper load for an injured muscle — I’d just point out that the expanding conversation reflects that focus on tweaking health and medical approaches as new scientific findings emerge. What I see as most compelling is a loose but well-reasoned growing consensus that suggests the better option is to replace RICE with MEAT, which stands for movement, exercise, analgesia, and treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerayi8o000k3b6nlszz9p1a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Here’s why. The downside of RICE is that it tamps down inflammation.&lt;br&gt;As you’ve read in previous chapters, some level of inflammation is necessary to activate healing processes and reduce the chance of developing chronic pain. While dialing down inflammation may initially ease pain, it also can delay or inhibit long-term tissue healing. The lesson is a critically important one when it comes to pain: let the body take care of itself as naturally as possible. Given what we now know, unless you have a fractured bone or can’t bear weight, RICE should no longer be the blanket recommendation for pain management.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeraysou000m3b6nxmc9re54@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Instead, the emphasis is now on these four steps:
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeray2p8000f3b6nd8y1woze@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Movement: &lt;/strong&gt;Mild movement or exercise improves blood flow and circula- tion of healing agents to the injured area. It stimulates muscle, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and other tissue, whereas stagnation can stall healing and lead to continuing pain.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmeraz3bh000p3b6nw1c3m3nh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Exercise: &lt;/strong&gt;This component is meant to kick in once the pain has lessened.&lt;br&gt;For a muscle injury, this would involve gentle moves designed to slowly restore function and flexibility. For other types of bruised or swollen soft tissue, for example, from surgery or trauma, mild exercise further improves circulation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerazj20000s3b6n9d59rzgd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Analgesia: &lt;/strong&gt;Cautious use of pain relievers if necessary, as well as the use of natural options such as turmeric or capsaicin instead of anti-inflammatories, which may inhibit healing for the reasons already described. Also consider topical anesthetics and analgesic patches, or mild transcutaneous neurostimulation such as the TENS device, which applies a low-voltage current to the skin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerazxfc000v3b6nvxsazm6p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Treatment:&lt;/strong&gt; The final component of MEAT refers to the range of tailored early treatment through various therapeutic approaches. These might include physical therapy, massage, acupuncture or other “dry needling” (solid needles containing no medication), myofascial release (and other techniques using targeted massage to release tension in a specific muscle area), joint mobilization (to improve range of motion), as well as use of ice and heat.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb0cbj000y3b6nvec3e2si@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Heat and cold therapy both can help relieve pain, though they work in different ways and are best for different situations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb0skl00113b6nh7oswhic@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Cold therapy is best for short-term pain, applied within the first seventy-two hours to counter swelling. Keep in mind that while cold temperature slows blood flow, which can help reduce pain from sprains, strains, and other acute injuries, it may also decrease inflammation, slow healing, and increase the likelihood of chronic pain. Regular cold-water plunges have gained a popular following in recent years, and some studies suggest that regular cold exposure through ice bathing or plunges may ease discomfort after intense workouts and help with stress regulation. These may not be the best options, however, for treating an injury. The practice continues to be the subject of debate because it may also carry risks for some people — in particular those with cardiovascular issues. The concern is something known as a cold shock response, which can lead to an increase in blood pressure and heart rate. Some may also hyperventilate, which can lead to fainting as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb1i0f00163b6n0hzkm4dv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Heat therapy is best for long-standing muscle pain, stiffness, and chronic pain conditions. Because it boosts blood flow, which can help relax muscles and ease aching joints, heat therapy is often recommended before exercise or stretching or to ease morning stiffness. Applying low-level heat for a longer period, such as with heat wraps you can buy at the drugstore, may reduce stiffness and tension and increase flexibility. Just be sure to follow product directions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Either way, don’t overdo it. When using a hot or cold pack, wrap it in a thin towel to protect your skin and apply it for no more than ten to twenty minutes to avoid skin damage. You can do this several times a day, but be sure to take breaks in between to let your skin and tissue recover. And stop using heat or cold therapy immediately if it worsens your pain or discomfort or if your skin reacts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Neither MEAT nor RICE is all wrong or always right. But with a basic understanding of these points of difference, you’re better equipped to eval- uate your options. The bottom line is that a desire for a quick fix may slow your overall healing process; as a general rule, be conservative with initial interventions like these and pay attention to the way your body responds; let the body heal itself and intervene only when necessary.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Renewed urgency about extended use of aspirin and NSAIDs
&lt;/h4&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb1gjo00143b6nnv7xgd79@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Now let’s return to your home medicine cabinet and the nonprescription painkillers you probably keep on hand. If your everyday go-to for pain relief is aspirin or another NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug), it’s time to take a fresh look at how you use it. We now have not just new information, but continued findings over time, that have renewed urgency about the serious risks NSAIDs present for some people, as well as the adverse effects of taking too much or taking them for too long.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb3xcv001i3b6njtzr2xgs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            NSAIDs provide predictable relief for so many routine aches and pains — arthritis flare-ups, headaches, fever, menstrual cramps, colds, flu — that it’s easy to lose track of how often you’re using them and how much you’re taking, and overlook their potential for toxic or other adverse effects. And because these drugs are sold over the counter, it often means you’re making a decision about medication without your physician’s guidance on how to avoid potential problems based on health conditions you may have or medications you may be taking. Keep in mind that these nonprescription medications were mostly intended for short-term use, so relying on them long term might put you at risk for complications.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb3xcv001j3b6nbtn85whq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Aspirin is a good example. For decades, aspirin has been used for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which is heart disease from plaque buildup in the arteries. In light of recent trial data, however, that practice is now controversial. The &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/25/health/aspirin-heart-older-adults-recommendations-wellness"&gt;risk of bleeding&lt;/a&gt; might simply be too high to justify the benefits of preventing heart disease in someone who’s otherwise healthy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb3xcv001k3b6n20nrx3gr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That is why in 2022, the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended that people over sixty years old should not take aspirin to pre- vent primary heart disease. Even for those aged forty to forty-nine who may have a lower bleeding risk, the benefit is still thought to be small. If you’ve already had heart problems or have a strong family history and no evidence of bleeding problems, your doctor may recommend a daily baby aspirin. But in general, many doctors have moved away from the practice.
    &lt;/p&gt;

        Supplements: Considerations, caution, and careful use
&lt;/h4&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb3w38001g3b6nut1f07b9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            People are turning increasingly to dietary supplements, seeking out substances they perceive as natural. Unfortunately, because there are very few good, randomized trials, it’s hard to find solid evidence of the benefits of this approach. Additionally, many of these “natural” supplements are unregulated, meaning there’s no guarantee that they’re safe or consistent. There may also be interactions with prescription medications you’re using or other health conditions the supplement could adversely affect. Still, even given the above caveats, I will name a few that are worth considering:
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb5l2s001s3b6nu21z5hpa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Coenzyme Q10 or C0Q10. &lt;/strong&gt;There is evidence that this coenzyme can improve mitochondrial function within cells and also act as an anti- inflammatory. Given the way it works, it may be most beneficial when taken after intense activity or with the use of statin drugs — both of which can be associated with muscle aches. It may also effectively lower blood pressure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb6shq001x3b6np6gr07mp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Magnesium. &lt;/strong&gt;Evidence exists that this simple mineral, which is found in all our bones, can help with pain, particularly in the lower back. By blocking calcium from entering cells, magnesium may reduce the excitability of your muscles, allowing them to relax and reduce spasm, especially after exercise.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb6shq001y3b6nh9gzhuia@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Turmeric. &lt;/strong&gt;Growing up in an Indian household, I’ve been eating turmeric since I was a kid. The active ingredient, curcumin, is thought to be a potent anti-inflammatory, particularly effective for osteoarthritis of the knees. Recently it has been recommended to help reduce the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. In recent lab experiments, however, turmeric  inhibited some chemotherapy drugs from working against breast cancer cells and also increased the risk of kidney stones, so make sure to check with your doctor if there is a concern. And buy from a reputable source.&lt;br&gt;Turmeric is among spices that have recently been flagged as potentially being contaminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerb7jjs00203b6nbmyxq7nk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Willow bark. &lt;/strong&gt;The active ingredient in willow bark is salicin, which is very similar to aspirin. It is broken down into salicylic acid, which helps decrease pain and fever, and like aspirin may have side effects such as upset stomach and bleeding problems. If you’re sensitive to aspirin, have kidney disease, or you’re taking a blood thinner (or planning surgery) check with your doctor.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            As you consider these or any of the many other options for pain relief we’re about to explore, keep this in mind: pain relief isn’t just about physical relief; it is an integral part of a complex, dynamic healing process that involves every other system in your body.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerbiwuk002d3b6n7dd7wbnh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One reason opiates have proven so destructive, especially when used as ongoing treatment for chronic pain, is that over time they corrupt those natural systems. In exchange for initial pain relief, they slowly disable processes essential for normal functioning and healing, and they can create new complications: constipation, nausea, slowed breathing, dizziness, depression, brain fog, and the obvious — dependence and addiction. All of these compromise healing and health, often prolong pain, and carry even greater health risks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerbiv4s002b3b6nsprv5629@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            We’ve seen remarkable progress in pain management since the days when opioids and steroids were used to treat most pain maladies. For neuropathic pain, that shooting or burning sensation, we now have drugs such as gabapentin, a prescription medication originally developed as an anticonvulsant, which regulates how pain messages travel from the brain through the spinal cord and reduces the excitability of nerve cells in the brain. “Gaba” (sold under the brand names Horizint, Grayliese, and Neurontin) was approved for treatment of neuropathic pain about twenty years ago, but it is far from a perfect drug. A 2017 review concluded that while around half of those treated had objective pain relief, they also often experienced adverse effects such as dizziness, drowsiness, tiredness, headache, nausea and vomiting, memory loss, weight gain, coordination problems, and eye problems. The drug worked best for postherpetic neuralgia; evidence for other types of neuropathic pain was very limited.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerbkht8002k3b6n6io6yxwc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            We’ve also seen an uptick of interest in the use of antidepressants for pain, especially for chronic migraines and long-standing arthritic pain. It’s not entirely clear yet why they help relieve pain for some people. The fact that they increase serotonin, which can improve mood, might be one reason. It may also be that they affect the &lt;em&gt;perception &lt;/em&gt;of pain, reducing the focus the person puts on it and thereby distracting them from it. What is clear is that these medications take a long time to work, sometimes up to several weeks, and even then, the patient may need regular dosage adjustments to minimize side effects. A 2021 systematic meta-review of thirty-three trials showed that serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) reduced back pain with moderate certainty, osteoarthritis pain with low certainty, and sciatica with very low certainty on pain and disability scores.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerbkht8002l3b6n0bqp7idc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A 2023 Cochrane network meta-analysis examining antidepressants across all chronic pain conditions concluded that after investigating twenty- five different antidepressants, “the only antidepressant we are certain about for the treatment of chronic pain is duloxetine. Duloxetine was moderately efficacious across all outcomes at standard dose.” There is also promising evidence for milnacipran, the study said, but higher-quality research is needed. “Evidence for all other antidepressants was low certainty.” Additionally, after randomized controlled trials excluded people with low mood, the review was unable to establish any beneficial effects of antidepressants for people with chronic pain. The review concluded that currently there is “no reliable evidence for the long-term efficacy of any anti-depressant.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmerbl6ig002n3b6n3ju627oc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In people who suffer chronic pain, there’s emerging evidence that their sensory neurons are more excitable than usual and can therefore be more easily triggered. For that reason, there’s new interest in the use of sodium channel blockers, an established tool for quieting seizures, which are also caused by overexcited nerve cells in the brain. Novocaine, which dentists inject into the tissue they want to numb for a procedure, is one example of a sodium channel blocker. The goal has been to turn that into a pill that works for chronic pain conditions, and researchers are currently making progress on that front.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Just this year, the FDA approved the first &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/30/health/fda-approves-painkiller-suzetrigine-journavx"&gt;new drug&lt;/a&gt; in a new class of non-opioid pain medicines, approved to treat moderate to severe acute pain in adults. The approval of Journavx (suzetrigine) marked the first approval of a new class of non-opioid pain relievers in more than two decades. While opioids primarily work by dulling sensations in the brain, the new drug, in fifty milligram oral tablets, is reported to reduce pain by targeting a pain-signaling pathway involving a specific sodium channel in the peripheral nervous system, before the pain signals reach the brain.&lt;br&gt;The efficacy of Journavx was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of acute surgical pain, one following abdominoplasty and the other following bunionectomy. In addition to receiving the randomized treatment, all participants in the trials with inadequate pain control were permitted to use ibuprofen as needed as a “rescue” pain medication. Both trials demonstrated a statistically significant superior reduction in pain with Journavx compared to placebo, the FDA said in announcing the approval.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The discovery of this drug has a fascinating backstory. Nearly twenty-five years ago, researchers learned about a family of fire walkers in Pakistan. They could walk on hot coals without flinching. Importantly, they felt the coals on their feet and even knew they were hot, but it was the specific sensation of pain they weren’t feeling. It wasn’t that their feet were numb, given that the nerves responsible for heat and touch seemed unaffected. Rather it was just the pain-conducting nerves that were affected. That observation led to a quarter-century investigation, the identification of a gene unique to this family, and ultimately helped inspire the development of the new medication.

These provide stronger pain relief than nonprescriptive options, but because they have potential for abuse and unpleasant and potentially serious side effects, they should be reserved for more severe types of pain.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li data-editable="items.1.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prescription drugs approved for other conditions&lt;/strong&gt; but repurposed “off-label” for pain. These include antidepressants and anticonvulsants.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li data-editable="items.2.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Neuromodulation&lt;/strong&gt;, including spinal cord stimulation (SCS), an implanted device that sends low levels of electricity directly into the spinal cord to relieve pain; deep brain stimulation (DBS); and local (external) electrical stimulation, applying brief pulses of electricity to nerve endings under the skin to provide pain relief (Scrambler, TENS).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li data-editable="items.3.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Injection therapies&lt;/strong&gt;, including: &lt;strong&gt;Epidural steroid injections&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Nerve blocks&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Joint injections&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Trigger point injections&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Dry needling&lt;/strong&gt;: Usually as part of a larger pain management plan, dry needling is sometimes recommended. The treatment, which can be initially painful, involves placing thin sharp needles through the skin and into what are known as “trigger points,” areas of muscle that have become knotted and tender. The needling can decrease tightness, improve blood flow, and reduce pain. It’s called “dry” because there are no medications in the needle, as with trigger point injections. &lt;strong&gt;Botox&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;strong&gt;Gel injections&lt;/strong&gt; (hyaluronic acid to mimic cushioning fluid in joints): often used for knee pain, especially mild to moderate arthritis. &lt;strong&gt;Prolotherapy injections&lt;/strong&gt; (concentrated sugar water to relieve pain in joints, ligaments, and tendons); &lt;strong&gt;Regenerative medicine&lt;/strong&gt; (orthobiologics): a newer category including injectables made from your own blood or tissue, or application of dressings using biomaterials (such as placenta), used to restore tissue in skin grafts and other wound or surgical sites. &lt;strong&gt;Platelet-rich plasma injections and cell therapy&lt;/strong&gt;: PRP injections involve taking the patient’s blood, isolating and concentrating the platelets, and injecting billions of them into the joint, ligament, or tendon. Some newer injectables, called cell therapies, collect cells and tissues from bone marrow or fat tissue. The cells are collected, cleansed, and injected into the patient’s joint, ligament, or tendon.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li data-editable="items.4.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Others&lt;/strong&gt;﻿, including: &lt;strong&gt;Nitrous oxide&lt;/strong&gt; (laughing gas); &lt;strong&gt;Radiofrequency ablation&lt;/strong&gt;, which treats spine pain by using radio waves to heat and destroy nerve tissue, preventing the associated pain signals from reaching the brain. There’s also pulsed electromagnetic wave therapy, a noninvasive FDA-approved treatment that uses magnetic field pulses to improve blood flow to a localized area of pain, such as that from rheumatoid arthritis. &lt;strong&gt;Transcranial magnetic stimulation&lt;/strong&gt; (TMS) is performed by placing a coil on the head to send magnetic pulses that can change the brain’s activity in areas associated with pain. A recent trial showed that the treatment, typically daily sessions for four to six weeks, results in about half of fibromyalgia patients experiencing a meaningful reduction in pain. &lt;strong&gt;Extracorporeal shock wave therapy&lt;/strong&gt;: Think of it as using high-energy sound waves through the skin right on top of the painful area. This type of therapy seems to trigger the body’s natural healing mechanisms, break down scar tissue, and stimulate the formation of new blood vessels.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li data-editable="items.5.text" class="factbox__item inline-placeholder"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surgery&lt;/strong&gt;. This can effectively relieve some kinds of pain, primarily that caused by structural issues. Most pain is not caused by structural issues, however, and in those cases, an operation not only won’t resolve the pain, it may even make things worse.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In the chaos,  agency experts felt restrained from talking openly with local public health workers, according to interviews with seven CDC officials with direct knowledge of events, as well as local health department emails obtained by KFF Health News through public records requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“CDC hasn’t reached out to us locally,” Katherine Wells, the public health director in Lubbock, Texas, wrote in a Feb. 5 email exchange with a colleague two weeks after children with measles were hospitalized in Lubbock. “My staff feels like we are out here all alone,” &lt;a class="link" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/170_4ea49e.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;she added&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A child would die before CDC scientists contacted Wells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All of us at CDC train for this moment, a massive outbreak,” one CDC researcher told KFF Health News, which agreed not to name CDC officials who fear retaliation for speaking with the press. “All this training and then we weren’t allowed to do anything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delays have catastrophic consequences when measles spreads in undervaccinated communities, including many in west Texas. If a person with measles is in the same room with 10 unvaccinated people, nine will be infected, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;researchers estimate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If those nine go about their lives in public spaces, numbers multiply exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak that unfolded in west Texas illustrates the danger the country faces under the Trump administration as vaccination &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;rates drop&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, misinformation flourishes, public health budgets are cut, and science agencies are subject to political manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the Trump administration stifled CDC communications, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fueled doubt&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about vaccines and exaggerated &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-on-vitamin-a-unsupported-therapies-for-measles/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the ability of vitamins&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to ward off disease. Suffering followed: The &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-2025" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Texas outbreak&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; spread to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nmhealth.org/about/erd/ideb/mog/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;New Mexico&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="link" href="https://oklahoma.gov/health/health-education/acute-disease-service/rash-illness/measles.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2314/Measles-Outbreak-Data" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Kansas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="link" href="https://cdphe.colorado.gov/press-release/public-health-officials-release-information-on-potential-measles-exposures" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Colorado&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.gob.mx/salud/documentos/situacion-epidemiologica-de-enfermedades-prevenibles-por-vacunacion" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mexico’s Chihuahua state&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — at minimum. Together these &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/74/wr/mm7414a1.htm" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;linked outbreaks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have sickened more than 4,500 people, killed at least 16, and levied exorbitant costs on hospitals, health departments, and those paying medical bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is absolutely outrageous,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University. “When you’re battling contagious diseases, time is everything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="the-cdc-is-stressed-currently" class="subhead"&gt;‘The CDC Is “Stressed” Currently’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells was anxious the moment she learned that two unvaccinated children hospitalized in &lt;a class="link" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/texas-measles-outbreak-gaines-county-public-health-measles-vaccine/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;late January&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had the measles. Hospitals are legally required to report measles cases to health departments and the CDC, but Wells worried many children weren’t getting tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I think this may be very large,” she wrote in a &lt;a class="link" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/124_125.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Feb. 3 email&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the Texas Department of State Health Services. Wells relayed in &lt;a class="link" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/124_125.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;another email&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; what she’d learned from conversations around town: “According to one of the women I spoke with 55 children were absent from one school on 1/24. The women reported that there were sick children with measles symptoms as early as November.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that email &lt;a class="link" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/251.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;and others&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Wells asked state health officials to put her in touch with CDC experts who could answer complicated questions on testing, how to care for infants exposed to measles, and more. What transpired was a plodding game of telephone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/164.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;One email&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; asked whether clinics could decontaminate rooms where people with measles had just been if the clinics were too small to follow the CDC’s recommendation to keep those rooms empty for two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Would it be possible to arrange a consultation with the CDC?” Wells wrote on Feb. 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It never hurts to ask the CDC,” said Scott Milton, a medical officer at the Texas health department. About 25 minutes later, he told Wells that an information specialist at the CDC had echoed the guidelines advising two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I asked him to escalate this question to someone more qualified,” &lt;a class="link" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/163.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Milton wrote&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Of course, we know the CDC is ‘stressed’ currently.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2f0c37b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1824x658+0+0/resize/320x115!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4c%2Fdc%2Fcc2e2f8e4497a30ab0a88261c008%2Ftear-sheet-163.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/aa57b48/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1824x658+0+0/resize/568x205!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4c%2Fdc%2Fcc2e2f8e4497a30ab0a88261c008%2Ftear-sheet-163.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b860b99/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1824x658+0+0/resize/768x277!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4c%2Fdc%2Fcc2e2f8e4497a30ab0a88261c008%2Ftear-sheet-163.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d9bb3c6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1824x658+0+0/resize/1024x369!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4c%2Fdc%2Fcc2e2f8e4497a30ab0a88261c008%2Ftear-sheet-163.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/961302d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1824x658+0+0/resize/1200x433!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4c%2Fdc%2Fcc2e2f8e4497a30ab0a88261c008%2Ftear-sheet-163.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="A Feb. 5 email from Texas health official Scott Milton, obtained through a public records request.

He wanted to reach scientists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who could answer urgent questions about measles from front-line workers in west Texas. Emails have been redacted to protect the privacy of individuals and facilities. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Screenshot by KFF Health News)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local officials resorted to advice from doctors and researchers outside the government, including those at the &lt;a class="link" href="https://immunizeusa.org/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Immunization Partnership&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a Texas nonprofit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The CDC had gone dark,” said Terri Burke, executive director of the partnership. “We had anticipated a measles outbreak, but we didn’t expect the federal government to be in collapse when it hit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically, the Trump administration’s &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25502931-acting-hhs-secretary-communications-memo-1-21-25/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;freeze on federal communications&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had ended Feb. 1. However, CDC scientists told KFF Health News that they could not speak freely for weeks after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There was a lot of confusion and nonanswers over what communications were allowed,” one CDC scientist said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Assn., said the situation was not unique to measles. “Like most public health organizations, we weren’t able to get ahold of our program people in February,” he said. Information trickled out through the CDC’s communications office, but CDC scientists gave no news briefings and went dark on their closest partners across the country. “The CDC was gagged,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through private conversations, Benjamin learned that CDC experts were being diverted to remove information from websites to comply with executive orders. And they were afraid to resume communication without a green light from their directors or the Department of Health and Human Services as they watched the Trump administration &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/02/14/nx-s1-5297913/cdc-layoffs-hhs-trump-doge" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lay off&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; CDC staffers in droves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s not that the CDC was delinquent,” Benjamin said. “It’s that they had their hands tied behind their backs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To work on the ground, the CDC needs an invitation from the state. But Anne Schuchat, a former CDC deputy director, said that during her 33 years with the agency, federal health officials didn’t need special permission to talk freely with local health departments during outbreaks. “We would always offer a conversation and ask if there’s anything we could do,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lara Anton, a press officer at the Texas health department, said the state never prevented the CDC from calling county officials. To learn more about the state’s correspondences with the CDC, KFF Health News filed a public records request to the Texas health department. The department refused to release the records. Anton called the records “confidential under the Texas Health and Safety Code.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anton said the state sent vaccines, testing supplies, and staff to assist west Texas in the early weeks of February. That’s &lt;a class="link" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/Email-State-Vaccines-To-Holbrooks_Redacted.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;corroborated in emails&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the South Plains Public Health District, which oversees Gaines County, the area hit hardest by measles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Texas will try to handle what it needs to before it goes to the CDC,” Zach Holbrooks, the health district’s executive director, told KFF Health News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responding to an outbreak in an undervaccinated community, however, requires enormous effort. To keep numbers from exploding, public health workers ideally would notify all people exposed to an infected person and ask them to get vaccinated immediately if they weren’t already. If they declined, officials would try to persuade them to avoid public spaces for three weeks so that they wouldn’t spread measles to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holbrooks said this was nearly impossible. Cases were concentrated in &lt;a class="link" href="https://anabaptistworld.org/texas-measles-outbreak-draws-attention-to-traditionalist-mennonite-community/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;close-knit Mennonite communities&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where people relied on home remedies before seeking medical care. He said many people didn’t want to be tested, didn’t want to name their contacts, and didn’t want to talk with the health department. “It doesn’t matter what resources I have if people won’t avail themselves of it,” Holbrooks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, Mennonites faced persecution in other countries, making them leery of interacting with authorities, Holbrooks said. A backlash against COVID-19 pandemic restrictions deepened that mistrust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another reason Mennonites may seek to avoid authorities is that some &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.thefp.com/p/the-illegal-immigrants-who-love-trump" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;live in the U.S. illegally&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, having immigrated to Texas from Canada, Mexico and Bolivia in waves over the last 50 years. &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.thefp.com/p/the-illegal-immigrants-who-love-trump" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Locals guess&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the population of Seminole, the main city in Gaines County, is &lt;a class="link" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/124_125.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;far larger&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than the &lt;a class="link" href="https://demographics.texas.gov/Resources/TDC/Conference/b5dd2dd3-e840-45db-9e1d-8b450bd37c74/20230524_2020CensusUndercountEngagingTexas.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;U.S. &lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;c&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;ensus&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have no idea how many cases we might have missed, since I don’t know how many people are in the community,” Holbrooks said. “There’s a lot of people in the shadows out here.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Public health experts say the situation in Gaines sounds tough but familiar. Measles tends to take hold in undervaccinated communities, and therefore public health workers must overcome mistrust, misinformation, language barriers and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="enhancement" data-click="enhancement" data-align-center&gt;&lt;figure class="figure"&gt; &lt;picture&gt;    &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/66b5a5b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1022x362+0+0/resize/320x113!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc8%2F5c%2F08978e8b45ff84d229973dfe2051%2Ftear-sheet-124.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ab86021/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1022x362+0+0/resize/568x201!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc8%2F5c%2F08978e8b45ff84d229973dfe2051%2Ftear-sheet-124.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5d7b878/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1022x362+0+0/resize/768x272!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc8%2F5c%2F08978e8b45ff84d229973dfe2051%2Ftear-sheet-124.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/65c5c1c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1022x362+0+0/resize/1024x363!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc8%2F5c%2F08978e8b45ff84d229973dfe2051%2Ftear-sheet-124.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0c840e2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1022x362+0+0/resize/1200x425!/format/webp/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc8%2F5c%2F08978e8b45ff84d229973dfe2051%2Ftear-sheet-124.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;       &lt;img class="image" alt="A Feb. 3 email from Katherine Wells to Texas state health official Imelda Garcia warning of a far larger measles outbreak " srcset="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cbab11b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1022x362+0+0/resize/320x113!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc8%2F5c%2F08978e8b45ff84d229973dfe2051%2Ftear-sheet-124.jpg 320w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/be1c3bf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1022x362+0+0/resize/568x201!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc8%2F5c%2F08978e8b45ff84d229973dfe2051%2Ftear-sheet-124.jpg 568w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bfd1082/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1022x362+0+0/resize/768x272!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc8%2F5c%2F08978e8b45ff84d229973dfe2051%2Ftear-sheet-124.jpg 768w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d3ea8f9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1022x362+0+0/resize/1024x363!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc8%2F5c%2F08978e8b45ff84d229973dfe2051%2Ftear-sheet-124.jpg 1024w,https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/47b82a1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1022x362+0+0/resize/1200x425!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc8%2F5c%2F08978e8b45ff84d229973dfe2051%2Ftear-sheet-124.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw" src="https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/47b82a1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1022x362+0+0/resize/1200x425!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc8%2F5c%2F08978e8b45ff84d229973dfe2051%2Ftear-sheet-124.jpg" decoding="async" loading="lazy"&gt;   &lt;/picture&gt;   &lt;div class="figure-content"&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-caption"&gt;A Feb. 3 email from Katherine Wells to a Texas state health official, Imelda Garcia, warning of a far larger measles outbreak than case numbers suggested. KFF Health News obtained emails through Freedom of Information Act requests to local health departments. The emails have been redacted to protect the privacy of individuals and facilities. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="figure-credit"&gt;(Screenshot by KFF Health News)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/figure&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 450 people — including local health officials, CDC scientists, nurses and volunteers — helped control a measles outbreak in an Eastern European immigrant community in &lt;a class="link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9004490/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Clark County&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Wash., in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan Melnick, Clark County’s public health director, said his team spoke with hundreds of unvaccinated people who were exposed. “We were calling them basically every day to see how they were doing and ask them not to go out in public,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melnick spoke with CDC scientists from the start, and the intensity of the response was buoyed by emergency declarations by the county and the state. Within a couple of months, the outbreak was largely contained. No one died, and only two people were hospitalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1912514" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;New York&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, hundreds of people in the city’s health department responded to a larger measles outbreak in 2018 and 2019 concentrated among Orthodox Jewish communities. The work included meeting with dozens of rabbis and distributing booklets to nearly 30,000 households to combat vaccine misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The effort cost more than $7 million, but Jane Zucker, New York City’s assistant health commissioner at the time, said it yielded immense savings. The average medical bill for measles hospitalizations is roughly $18,500, according to &lt;a class="link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8103967/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;data from prior&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33712549/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;outbreaks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Then there’s the cost of diverting hospital resources, of children missing school, of parents staying home from work to care for sick kids, and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay6485" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the lasting toll&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of some measles infections, including &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/opinion/vaccine-hesitancy.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;deafness or worse&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I don’t think there’s a price tag to put on a child’s death that would otherwise be prevented,” Zucker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local health departments in west Texas were understaffed from the start. About 18 people work at the South Plains health department, which oversees four vast rural counties. About 50 staff the department in Lubbock, where patients were hospitalized and health workers struggled to figure out who was exposed. In mid-February, Wells &lt;a class="link" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/401.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;emailed a colleague&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “I’m so overwhelmed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="a-death-ignites-a-response" class="subhead"&gt;A Death Ignites a Response&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 26, Texas announced that &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-first-death-measles-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a 6-year-old child had died&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of measles. Wells heard from CDC scientists for the first time the following day. Also that day, the CDC issued a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2025/2025-cdc-statement-on-measles-outbreak.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;brief notice&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the outbreak. The notice recommended vaccines, but it worried public health specialists because it also promoted vitamin A as a treatment under medical supervision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/278_46af73.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;In emails&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Texas health officials privately discussed how the CDC’s notice might exacerbate &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.idsociety.org/science-speaks-blog/2025/talking-to-patients-about-measles-vitamin-a-and-the-importance-of-vaccination/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a problem&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Doctors were &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.tpr.org/public-health/2025-03-27/west-texas-children-treated-for-vitamin-a-toxicity-as-medical-disinformation-spreads-alongside-measles-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;treating children&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with measles for toxic levels of vitamin A, suggesting that parents were delaying medical care and administering the supplements at home.

We haven’t seen those babies born yet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another CDC official said they’ve had to “walk a fine line” between protecting the public based on scientific evidence and aligning with  Health and Human Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While CDC scientists held their tongues, Kennedy exaggerated the power of nutrition and vitamin A while furthering mistrust in vaccines. “We’re providing vitamin A,” Kennedy said in an interview on &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369907937112" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fox News&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “There are many studies, some showing 87% effectiveness,” he claimed, “against serious disease and death.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="link" href="https://methods.cochrane.org/equity/vitamin-measles#:~:text=for%20disadvantaged%20communities-,Vitamin%20A%20reduces%20the%20risk%20of%20death%20from%20measles%20by,measles%2Drelated%20deaths%20and%20complications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;studies Kennedy referenced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were conducted in low-income countries where children are malnourished.

It does cause deaths every year,” he said. “It causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes, encephalitis and blindness, etc.” There is &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/03/rfk-jr-misleads-about-measles-vaccine-in-hannity-interview/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;no evidence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that measles vaccines “cause deaths every year.” Scores of studies show that the vaccine &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004407.pub5/full" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;doesn’t cause&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; encephalitis, that most potential side effects resolve quickly on their own, and serious adverse reactions are far rarer than measles complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/rfk-jr-mmr-vaccine-fetus-b2742886.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;another interview,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Kennedy said, “The MMR vaccine contains a lot of aborted fetus debris.” The measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, vaccine &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.aap.org/en/news-room/fact-checked/fact-checked-vaccines-do-not-contain-fetal-cells-thimerosal/?srsltid=AfmBOooFb-cjKAkF4bdqTZQGSfABTYTou4a103IbBEydq3cDgzmGs1xo" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;does not contain&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; an iota of fetal cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon and spokespeople at the CDC did not respond to queries from KFF Health News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 id="staff-are-exhausted" class="subhead"&gt;‘Staff Are Exhausted’&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite national attention after the country’s first measles death in a decade, west Texas was overwhelmed. In late February and March, hospital administrators and health officials exchanged emails about how to lobby for resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Local hospitals are at capacity,” &lt;a class="link" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/257_bdb6df.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;wrote Jeffrey Hill&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a senior vice president at the University Medical Center Health System in Lubbock. “The state reports emergency funds that typically cover a response like the measles outbreak are not available from the federal government right now,” &lt;a class="link" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/260.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;he added.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am writing to express our urgent need for additional staff and funding,” Ronald Cook, medical director for Lubbock, said in &lt;a class="link" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/104.png" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;an email&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, drafted with other Lubbock health authorities, to the deputy city manager. “Our Capacity is Stretched Thin: The health department has been operating seven days a week since February 2nd. Staff are exhausted.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city of Lubbock fronted money to help the local health department hire temporary staff. The state did not provide money, but it asked the CDC to send epidemiologists. Some came to Texas in early March. Then Texas requested federal funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None arrived, even as the outbreak approached 500 cases. It &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/measles-takes-root-mexico" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;spread to Mexico&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when an unvaccinated Mennonite child returned home after visiting family in Seminole. This would fuel the largest outbreak Mexico has seen &lt;a class="link" href="https://liberties.aljazeera.com/en/mexico-grapples-with-its-worst-measles-outbreak-in-decades/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in decades&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with at least 3,700 cases and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.gob.mx/salud/documentos/situacion-epidemiologica-de-enfermedades-prevenibles-por-vacunacion" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;13 deaths&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the state of Chihuahua.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then another child in west Texas &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-second-death-measles-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;died of measles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a rare moment of openness, CDC scientist David Sugarman mentioned the outbreak at a vaccine &lt;a class="link" href="https://tinalexander.github.io/notes/2025/04" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;advisory meeting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in late April. “There are quite a number of resource requests coming in, in particular from Texas,” Sugarman said. “We are scraping to find the resources and personnel needed to provide support to Texas and other jurisdictions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal funds arrived in Texas on May 21, said Anton, the state health department spokesperson. By then, the crisis was fading. The outbreak seemed to have spread until every unvaccinated person in Seminole was infected, said Richard Eby, a doctor at Permian Regional Medical Center who treated some measles patients. Hundreds, if not thousands, of cases have probably gone undetected, he said. “A lot of people presumed their kids had measles,” he said, “and didn’t see the need to confirm it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Aug. 18, health officials declared the west Texas &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-end-west-texas-measles-outbreak" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;outbreak over&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but the consequences of the catastrophe will be lasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreaks it sparked across the U.S. and Mexico are still spreading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More are inevitable, Nuzzo said. A growing number of parents are deciding &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/measles-elimination-status-what-it-is-and-how-the-u-s-could-lose-it/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;to not vaccinate&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; their kids, worried over unfounded rumors about the shots. Misinformation is flourishing, especially after Kennedy fired vaccine experts who advise the CDC and replaced them with doctors and researchers &lt;a class="link" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/kennedy-rfk-vaccine-panel-acip-cdc-hhs-immunizations/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;on the fringes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the scientific establishment. For example, one of his recent appointees, Robert Malone, &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/RWMaloneMD/status/1908665463279677915" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;blamed the deaths of children&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with measles on “medical mismanagement,” &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/04/16/texas-measles-misinformation-vaccines/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;without evidence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, states are downsizing programs for emergency response, disease surveillance, and immunization after the Trump administration clawed back more than &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/26/health/trump-state-health-grants-cuts.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$11 billion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in public health funds this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid Lubbock’s toughest months, Wells sent &lt;a class="link" href="https://kffhealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/253.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;an email&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the department’s exhausted staff. “The future is uncertain, and I know this is an unsettling time for many of us,” she wrote. “Every day we show up and do our jobs is an act of resilience.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Maxmen&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;writes for KFF Health News, a national newsroom focused on in-depth journalism about health issues and a core program of &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.kff.org/about-us/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;KFF&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, a nonprofit organization specializing in health policy research, polling, and journalism.

That’s usually caused by an infection, but her tests came back normal. High dose steroids, a standard treatment, weren’t effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;By that point, the girl’s brain was so swollen physicians had to remove part of her skull to relieve the pressure, which had put her at risk of brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;She was “critically ill,” recalled Whitney Reid, an immunologist and one of her doctors at CHOP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Frustrated and lacking answers, her doctors sequenced her DNA. They found she had an ultra-rare genetic disorder in which the immune system becomes dysfunctional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;The disorder, complement factor I deficiency, is caused by mutations in a gene that would normally regulate part of the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;It can cause harmful inflammation, particularly in the brain and spinal cord. That can present as a fever, nausea, confusion, dizziness, and even numbness. The condition also leads to recurrent bacterial infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Complement factor I deficiency is so rare it affects fewer than one in a million people born worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;The discovery spurred the Clinic for Special Children, an independent clinic in Lancaster County dedicated to treating patients with rare genetic disorders, to test several more Amish patients for the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Soon, physicians had identified a cluster of cases, leading doctors at CHOP and the Clinic to another surprising finding: Among the Old Order Amish, the largest group of Amish people, the disorder is estimated to affect as many as 1 in 730 people. That’s because mutations causing the disorder are more than 4,500 times more common in this group than in the general population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;This statistic, &lt;a class="relative z-1 text-blue-mid hover:shadow-lightmode" data-link-type="article-body" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674925006980" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674925006980"&gt;reported in a new study&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology&lt;/i&gt;, led doctors to revisit past instances of brain inflammation in Amish patients, and ultimately solve a yearslong medical mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=" relative w-fit mt-6 mb-0 font-inquirer-headline text-primary"&gt;&lt;h3 class="block font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-5 leading-5 sm:text-8 sm:leading-8 lg:text-9 lg:leading-9"&gt;An undiagnosed mystery&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Amish patients had been showing up at the Clinic for Special Children and nearby hospitals with brain inflammation for years. Doctors couldn’t figure out what was causing it. They would simply treat the patients and send them home once the symptoms resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Many likely had complement factor I deficiency, but were undiagnosed, said Vincent Carson, a pediatric neurologist at the Clinic and co-senior author on the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;“Nobody was looking for it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;After&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;CHOP diagnosed the Amish girl in 2021 with the disorder, doctors began to test symptomatic Amish patients&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;for the disorder. Carson&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;even sent messages out to colleagues around the country alerting them to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;“When they identified this in the first patient, that then made us look at anybody from the Amish community through a different lens,” Carson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;This isn’t the first genetic disorder to be overrepresented in the Amish community. The Clinic was specifically founded in 1989 in response to higher rates of rare genetic diseases in Amish and Mennonite people. Some of the most notable are a type of dwarfism called Ellis-van Creveld syndrome and assorted metabolic disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;The reason for this comes down to a phenomenon called the “founder effect,” which happens when a small number of individuals isolate from the larger population. Over generations, this leads to less&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;genetic diversity, with the genes of the “founders” becoming disproportionately present in the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;It’s kind of like if you took a crayon pack, picked just a few colors, and threw the rest away. All your drawings will be some combination of those colors from now on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Most of the approximately &lt;a class="relative z-1 text-blue-mid hover:shadow-lightmode" data-link-type="article-body" href="https://groups.etown.edu/amishstudies/population-2024/" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://groups.etown.edu/amishstudies/population-2024/"&gt;400,000 Amish people&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;in America&lt;/a&gt; descend from just a few hundred settlers who immigrated to the United States in the 18th century. Any errors in the genetic code of those original members were more likely to spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;That includes the genetic mutation that causes complement factor I deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=" relative w-fit mt-6 mb-0 font-inquirer-headline text-primary"&gt;&lt;h3 class="block font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-5 leading-5 sm:text-8 sm:leading-8 lg:text-9 lg:leading-9"&gt;A dysfunctional immune system&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;The disorder affects&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;a group of proteins in the immune system that help clear bacteria and viruses from the body. Known as “the complement system,” it helps fight infection, but should only be turned on when there’s an active threat. Otherwise, it could cause damage to healthy cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;People with the disorder lack a protein called “complement factor I,” which normally turns the system off when it’s not needed. This results in the complement system running wild, like a car without a brake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;“If a patient is missing that protein, they could be predisposed to having that part of the immune system attack their own bodies,” said Reid, who was first author on the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Amish families would often share stories of kids being more sick than their siblings, and having a history of pneumonia, ear infections, and even infections that turned fatal, Carson said. Those were likely undiagnosed cases of the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Reid and Carson recently held a family education day at the Clinic for the Amish community to learn more about complement factor I deficiency. They emphasized the importance of couples with a family history doing genetic testing to see if they have the mutation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Knowing you have the disease could help families watch out for potentially dangerous symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;For example, doctors can give families an emergency plan if their child has a fever, including antibiotics to use at home. Additional vaccines could be given to help prevent dangerous infections caused by pneumococcal and meningococcal bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;They could also warn parents to seek care quickly if a child has a bad headache or is more tired than usual, because that could indicate inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;For unknown reasons, this symptom seems to occur mostly in females, starting in their teenage years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;The Amish girl at CHOP was only 17 when brain inflammation landed her in the intensive care unit. In addition to getting skull surgery and steroids, she received therapeutic cooling and blood plasma exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;At first, these treatments seemed to work, but then her symptoms returned, including a fever, vomiting, altered mental status, and dizziness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Once doctors found out she had complement factor I deficiency, that helped them find the right medicine to treat her. They chose a drug called eculizumab, which inhibits the complement system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;Within a day or two, she recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;“She is perfectly fine, and is a schoolteacher living her life very happily,” said Reid, who saw her a few weeks ago along with Carson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="inq-p text-primary  "&gt;“You wouldn’t even know that she went through such an ordeal,” Carson added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="lazyload-placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Inquirer.com</author><pubDate>Tue, 26 Aug 2025 09:00:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivgFBVV95cUxNbHhyd28tSFktMi1KZVR2SXdQT2llV3dmblRLXzlnVXowajNCTC03RlgtTS14ZVAxc24wR0dpWVRHeURCYVVLXzJVNk5SM2xaSGFfeTc1ampERk5Pem50LXN1SWh6alVTYjk0WjRmWTZvdzcyYkZmbFFJZW1PSXR0Njh5cm5LRFQyeDZncTFYSkIxU2RSVUtLcEJheDNlUmVJYTRyLWZBUS1QR0kxOE8wekZrQU9PVDl4MU93eU53</guid></item><item><title>担心微塑料？以下是如何从水中去除高达90 ％的微塑料-食品和葡萄酒</title><link>https://www.foodandwine.com/boiling-water-removes-microplastics-study-11796372</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Findings published by researchers in China reveal that boiling water can be an effective way to remove microplastics from the liquid.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When water is boiled, naturally occurring minerals like calcium carbonate form crystals and trap nano- and microplastic particles, causing them to precipitate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This makes it easy to separate the particles from the water and could potentially remove up to 90% of microplastics from mineral-rich, hard tap waters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Although they're tiny, microplastics are becoming big news. In the 20 years since scientists first used the term &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adl2746" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;microplastics&lt;/a&gt; — a word that describes small plastic particles less than five millimeters in length — a growing body of research has revealed how omnipresent they are, floating in our &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/microplastics-in-seafood-study-8773102" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;oceans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/plastic-planet-how-tiny-plastic-particles-are-polluting-our-soil" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;soil&lt;/a&gt;, and even in the &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03453-1" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="4" rel="nofollow"&gt;human brain&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; As we become more aware of where microplastics are and the effects they can have on human health, we're also learning about how we can reduce our exposure to them. And according to new research, when it comes to our drinking water, that may be easier than you think.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In early 2024, researchers from Guangzhou Medical University and Jinan University in China published the findings of a study on eliminating microplastics from tap water in the peer-reviewed scientific journal &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.4c00081" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Environmental Science &amp;amp; Technology Letters&lt;/a&gt;, and the solution might come down to one simple step: boiling water. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block foodandwine-sc-block-embed mntl-sc-block-universal-embed mntl-sc-block-embed--youtube"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To analyze the effects of boiling water that contains microplastics, the team spiked tap water with three common plastics: polystyrene, polyethylene, and polypropylene. The researchers observed that when the water hit a roiling boil, naturally occurring minerals like calcium carbonate began forming solid crystals. Those crystals surrounded and trapped the plastic particles in the water before settling at the bottom of the liquid. Scientists then allowed the water to cool and separated out the deposits of minerals and microplastics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to their findings, boiling and filtering out these crystals can remove up to 90% of the nano- and microplastic particles (NMPs) present. However, it's critical to note that the water needed to have a high mineral content — defined as "hard water" — for the boiling to prove this effective. In soft water with a lower mineral content, the team saw reductions of around 25% of microplastics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; "This simple boiling-water strategy can 'decontaminate' NMPs from household tap water and has the potential for harmlessly alleviating human intake of NMPs through water consumption," the authors explained.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Because the mineral content and amount of microplastics in tap water can vary so greatly around the world, researchers approximated that the amount of microplastics ingested on a daily basis from boiled water could range between two to five times less than that of regular tap water, depending on where the water is sourced from.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; These results present a promising and affordable way to reduce microplastic exposure around the world. Although more research with a greater sample size is needed, scientists pointed out that, "our results have ratified a highly feasible strategy to reduce human NMP exposure and established the foundation for further investigations..."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you're worried about exposure to microplastics through food and drink, there are a few other simple steps you can take to diminish the presence of these particles in your kitchen, including swapping out plastic cutting boards for &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/best-wooden-cutting-boards-8628824" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;wooden cutting boards&lt;/a&gt; or replacing plastic utensils with materials like metal, wood, and silicone.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Another easy substitution? Check the material makeup of your cleaning rags. As Lisa Erdle, PhD — a biologist, ecotoxicologist, and the director of science and innovation at the &lt;a href="https://www.5gyres.org/team" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;5 Gyres Institute&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit focused on reducing plastic pollution — previously advised, “opting for &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/how-to-reduce-microplastics-in-the-kitchen-11760233" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;home textiles&lt;/a&gt; made from natural fibers [like cotton] instead of synthetic” is an easy way to lessen the spread of microplastics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While we await more research on the impact of microplastics and how to avoid them, at least existing information shows that many of us can easily implement a few strategies to decrease the presence of these particles at home.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to reduce your exposure without putting in a ton of work? Here are a few simple swaps to start with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replace nonstick pans: &lt;/strong&gt;While artificially nonstick pans may be easier to clean, they're often coated in polytetrafluoroethylene, a plastic coating that degrades and releases particles into your food over time. Instead, you can opt for materials like cast iron, stainless steel, carbon steel, and some ceramic skillets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swap single-use plastic storage:&lt;/strong&gt; Invest in glass or stainless steel storage containers and ditch those single-use plastic storage bags for your leftovers. This will reduce your exposure to microplastics and save you money in the long run.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid takeout containers:&lt;/strong&gt; Whenever possible, avoid plastic takeout containers, which not only shed microplastics but may also leach chemicals that could be harmful to your &lt;a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/plastic-food-containers-heart-failure-study-11684440" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 3 clinical trial results from Scripps Research and its collaborators supported FDA approval of ENCELTO, the first cell-based treatment for the neurodegenerative retinal disease known as MacTel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For individuals with macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel), a rare retinal disease that steadily erodes central vision, no approved therapies had previously existed. Now, a study led by investigators at Scripps Research and the &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;National Institutes of Health&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the primary agency of the United States government responsible for biomedical and public health research. Founded in 1887, it is a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The NIH conducts its own scientific research through its Intramural Research Program (IRP) and provides major biomedical research funding to non-NIH research facilities through its Extramural Research Program. With 27 different institutes and centers under its umbrella, the NIH covers a broad spectrum of health-related research, including specific diseases, population health, clinical research, and fundamental biological processes. Its mission is to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;National Institutes of Health&lt;/span&gt; (NIH), and sponsored by Neurotech Pharmaceuticals, provides strong evidence that a neuroprotective surgical implant can slow the progression of vision loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a step toward redefining how we think about vision loss,” says Professor Martin Friedlander of Scripps Research, one of the study’s corresponding authors. “Instead of waiting for cells to die, we’re learning how to protect and preserve them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research, published in &lt;em&gt;NEJM&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Evidence&lt;/em&gt; on July 22, 2025, presents findings from two phase 3 clinical trials of ENCELTO (revakinagene taroretcel-lwey), an implanted device that steadily releases a therapeutic protein to help maintain vision. The trials, conducted over 24 months at 47 sites worldwide, enrolled 228 people with MacTel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coordinated through a global collaboration of clinicians and scientists, with contributions from the NIH’s National Eye Institute, the Lowy Medical Research Institute, and Neurotech Pharmaceuticals, the trials provided the critical data that supported the US Food and Drug Administration’s March 2025 approval of ENCELTO. This decision marked the first approved therapy for MacTel and the first cell-based neuroprotective treatment for any neurodegenerative retinal or central nervous system disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Consistent preservation of vision across trials&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two trials were designed in the same way but involved participants recruited at different times and locations. Both demonstrated that ENCELTO slowed the decline of light-sensing retinal cells, though one trial showed a stronger effect, likely reflecting differences in disease severity and other variables among participants. Taken together, the findings strongly support the implant’s ability to help preserve vision in individuals with MacTel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the first time we’ve seen a therapy meaningfully alter the course of MacTel,” says Friedlander. “It confirms that neuroprotection can be a powerful strategy to preserve vision in degenerative retinal conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure id="attachment_490839" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-490839" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Healthy-Retina-and-MacTel-Affected-Retina-Images.jpg"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" class="size-large wp-image-490839" src="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Healthy-Retina-and-MacTel-Affected-Retina-Images-673x1200.jpg" alt="Healthy Retina and MacTel Affected Retina Images" srcset="https://scitechdaily.com/images/Healthy-Retina-and-MacTel-Affected-Retina-Images-673x1200.jpg 673w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Healthy-Retina-and-MacTel-Affected-Retina-Images-337x600.jpg 337w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Healthy-Retina-and-MacTel-Affected-Retina-Images-768x1369.jpg 768w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Healthy-Retina-and-MacTel-Affected-Retina-Images-150x267.jpg 150w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Healthy-Retina-and-MacTel-Affected-Retina-Images-450x802.jpg 450w, https://scitechdaily.com/images/Healthy-Retina-and-MacTel-Affected-Retina-Images.jpg 777w" sizes="(max-width: 673px) 100vw, 673px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-490839" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Images of a healthy retina (top) and a retina affected by macular telangiectasia type 2 (bottom). Credit: Scripps Research&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedlander, who also serves as president of the Lowy Medical Research Institute, has studied MacTel for nearly 20 years and helped build the scientific foundation for ENCELTO. The implant delivers ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), a natural protein known to protect retinal neurons. It consists of genetically engineered retinal pigment epithelial cells, which provide essential support to the retina, enclosed in a small collagen-based capsule implanted at the back of the eye. This capsule shields the cells from immune attack while allowing them to release CNTF continuously, enabling long-term, localized treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Significant reduction in photoreceptor loss&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research showed that ENCELTO substantially slowed the degeneration of photoreceptors—light-detecting nerve cells essential for central vision—compared with sham-treated eyes that underwent a simulated surgery without receiving the implant. In one trial, the implant reduced the rate of ellipsoid zone loss, a marker of photoreceptor damage, by 54.8%. The second trial demonstrated a 30.6% reduction, smaller in magnitude but still statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond structural changes, the study assessed multiple measures of visual function, including microperimetry (a sensitive test of retinal light response) and reading speed. Microperimetry results indicated a clear slowing of functional decline, especially in the trial that showed stronger photoreceptor preservation. However, outcomes for reading speed and retinal sensitivity were mixed, with one trial showing improvement while the other found no significant difference compared with controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These differences highlight just how complex it is to measure functional vision loss in a slow-progressing disease like MacTel,” points out Friedlander. “If you look at certain functional outcomes from just one of the trials, they’re not statistically significant. But when you pool data from both trials—which were conducted the same way—then you see statistically significant results, so we’ll continue to investigate what’s driving that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Benefits with early intervention&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the variability, the overall trend across both trials supports ENCELTO’s long-term benefit, particularly when treatment is initiated before extensive cell loss. Participants tolerated the implant well, with minimal side effects. Furthermore, ENCELTO was effective regardless of the participant’s baseline vision or disease stage, suggesting that earlier intervention may help preserve more functional vision as MacTel progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, Friedlander and his team will assess whether benefits continue or even improve beyond 24 months. There are also plans to explore why some individuals experienced greater gains than others, which may help identify patient subgroups that are most likely to benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The consistency in preserving retinal cells across both trials gives us confidence in the mechanism,” says Friedlander. “As we refine how and when to treat MacTel, we expect even greater improvements in vision over time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, because ENCELTO delivers sustained, targeted doses of therapeutic proteins directly to the retina, it represents a versatile platform technology. This same approach could potentially be adapted to treat a wide range of neurovascular degenerative diseases beyond MacTel, including other blinding conditions where protecting vulnerable nerve cells is key.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Stock&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two bacteria working in harmony show powerful antitumor effects. The approach could transform treatment for immunocompromised patients.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A research team led by Professor Eijiro Miyako at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST), working in collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd. and the University of Tsukuba, has created a pioneering bacterial therapy for cancer that operates independently of the immune system. This new approach relies on a specially designed microbial consortium called AUN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of bacterial cancer therapy dates back to 1868, when German physician Busch reported that intentionally infecting a patient with bacteria led to tumor regression. Later, in 1893, Dr. William Coley proposed bacterial injections as a treatment, laying the foundation for cancer immunotherapy. Over the past 150 years, these early ideas evolved into advanced treatments such as checkpoint inhibitors and CAR-T cells. While effective for some, these therapies all depend on immune cell activity, which limits their effectiveness in patients whose immune systems are weakened by chemotherapy or radiotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

Credit: Eijiro Miyako from JAIST&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new AUN therapy overcomes this challenge by combining two naturally occurring bacterial strains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proteus mirabilis (A-gyo), a microbe that thrives within tumors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhodopseudomonas palustris (UN-gyo), a photosynthetic bacterium&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Mechanisms of tumor eradication&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working in close cooperation, the “AUN” bacterial pair achieved remarkable tumor clearance in both mouse and human cancer models, even under immunocompromised conditions—all without relying on immune cells. The therapy demonstrated strong biocompatibility and very limited side effects, notably preventing cytokine release syndrome (CRS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this study, AUN’s potent antitumor activity was driven by several coordinated bacterial mechanisms, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Harmony between bacterial partners&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, UN-gyo functions as a regulatory partner only when coexisting with A-gyo, helping to suppress the pathogenicity of both strains while simultaneously enhancing their tumor-specific cytotoxicity. This “cooperation of labor” mirrors the Japanese philosophical concept of “AUN”—perfect harmony between opposites. It is this delicate and dynamic interplay between the two bacterial &lt;span class="glossaryLink" aria-describedby="tt" data-cmtooltip="&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemTitle&amp;gt;species&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;div class=glossaryItemBody&amp;gt;A species is a group of living organisms that share a set of common characteristics and are able to breed and produce fertile offspring. The concept of a species is important in biology as it is used to classify and organize the diversity of life. There are different ways to define a species, but the most widely accepted one is the biological species concept, which defines a species as a group of organisms that can interbreed and produce viable offspring in nature. This definition is widely used in evolutionary biology and ecology to identify and classify living organisms.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" data-gt-translate-attributes='[{"attribute":"data-cmtooltip", "format":"html"}]' tabindex="0" role="link"&gt;species&lt;/span&gt; that unlocks the remarkable antitumor efficacy—a feat previously unattainable through conventional therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To accelerate the social implementation of this research, we are preparing to launch a startup and aim to begin clinical trials within six years,” said Professor Eijiro Miyako, lead author of the study.&lt;br&gt;
“A new chapter in bacteria-based cancer therapy—pursued for over 150 years—is finally beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This revolutionary approach represents a paradigm shift for immunocompromised cancer patients. It offers a long-awaited therapeutic solution in cases where conventional immunotherapies fail—ushering in the dawn of truly immune-independent cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
