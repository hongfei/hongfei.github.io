          &lt;p&gt;I havent\’t seen this anywhere except locally.  Bird flu got into Hickman Farms egg production facilities. The lost 6 million chickens so far and had to lay off many workers. &lt;/p&gt;

There were times when they thought they might lose Max. Throughout that period, in and out of the NICU watching their tiny baby, Rogut took “the very male supporting role”. He supported his wife. He was the point of contact if anyone needed to know what was going on. But it felt as though he was in a sensory deprivation tank.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;He became detached from everything and anything. “I was very much in survival mode – but trying to keep everyone else sort of above water.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Staff would check in and ask, “How’s mum doing today?” No one asked about how Rogut was doing unless his forthright wife told them to. His friends would get in touch, but there wasn’t much they could do. About halfway through the 121 days Max spent in hospital, his wife was diagnosed with postnatal depression, which helped her access support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="91d9d7d9-0b7e-404b-9383-1355f8de8773" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":4,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"‘I didn’t even know men could get it’: the hidden impact of male postnatal depression","elementId":"91d9d7d9-0b7e-404b-9383-1355f8de8773","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/may/22/i-didnt-even-know-men-could-get-it-the-hidden-impact-of-male-postnatal-depression"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“But yeah, there was nothing really for me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Max was born in March. He came home around July. The new family got into a routine. Rogut was problem solving, helping his wife. He had friends around him. It would have looked to the outside world that he was doing OK. That he was being a good dad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“I didn’t realise how bad I was until about November, December when I hit the wall.” He became clinically depressed, suicidal. He checked into a hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; baby is a beautiful thing. But for decades, after years of advocacy, researchers and health systems have recognised that the arrival of a baby can also be a challenging, traumatic, disorienting thing for new mothers. &lt;a href="https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/mothers-babies/perinatal-mental-health-screening-australia/contents/what-is-perinatal-mental-health" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Up to one in five mothers&lt;/a&gt; experience perinatal anxiety or depression. As a result, women are screened for their mental health at metronomic points throughout the orchestrated health path from confirmation of pregnancy through to their infant’s routine immunisations. Maternal mental health remains a serious problem, but one for which a system exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There is no such system for fathers. And an increasing body of research shows about one in 10 fathers experience serious mental health issues in the period before and after their child is born. It is also showing that the impacts of this are not just devastating for the fathers, but for their partners and their children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“We don’t have a community where we wrap our arms around fathers in the same way that we do around mothers in the early stages,” says Deakin University Associate Professor Jacqui Macdonald, convener of the Australian Fatherhood Research Consortium. “Instead the language is around fathers being a support for the mother. There’s not a discussion about who the support is for fathers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It means that fathers, like Rogut – but not limited to those who have had traumatic experiences – can&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;slip through the cracks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When you think about the challenges facing a first-time father, says Associate Professor Richard Fletcher, who leads the Fathers and Families Research Program at the University of Newcastle, “the context for him having the baby is one that’s like being in a desert and not even being aware of how thirsty you are, but there’s no water anywhere”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The dads are isolated from pretty well everything.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It is not a phenomenon limited to Australia. Dr Sharin Baldwin conducted a systematic review on perinatal mental health in the UK in 2018. “What stands out most is how often men feel invisible or excluded in the perinatal period,” she says. Meanwhile, they were dealing with challenges associated with changes in identity and their relationship, financial pressures and work-life balance.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Not much has changed since then, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Many men suffer in silence during one of the most significant transitions in their lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Families don’t work as individuals, they work as systems. So if one part of that system is really struggling, the rest of the system isn’t going to be working as well,” Macdonald says. “If we can care for the father, then the father does provide a better source of care. The father becomes a partner of the healthcare system in supporting the mother and child, but that’s not possible if we haven’t cared for the father as well.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;he figure of 10% of new fathers experiencing mental health difficulties, such as anxiety and depression, is an estimation. One reason, says Macdonald, is “we don’t really have proper screening anywhere for new fathers”. The second is that male depression often looks quite different from perinatal depression in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“What we do find is very high correlations between feelings of anger. It doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re aggressive, it just means that there’s an internalised sense of anger,” she says. It may be adaptive, “a sense [in fathers] that there’s an energy there to manage; to fight against this feeling of depression and sadness – but it needs support.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside data-spacefinder-role="supporting" class="dcr-1eyan6r"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 22 14" class="dcr-scql1j"&gt;&lt;path d="M5.255 0h4.75c-.572 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941H0C.792 9.104 2.44 4.53 5.255 0Zm11.061 0H21c-.506 4.53-1.077 8.972-1.297 13.941h-8.686c.902-4.837 2.485-9.411 5.3-13.941Z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;blockquote class="dcr-zzndwp"&gt;There’s been this lifetime of socialisation towards motherhood for women, and less so of that for men&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;footer&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Associate Professor Jacqui Macdonald&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33975226/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recent systematic review of paternal coping&lt;/a&gt; identified in fathers a cohort of what Macdonald calls “dual copers” – men who look as if they are doing really well but have underlying unaddressed unease. “These dual copers in men often are also engaging in avoidant behaviours. Things that are distracting, things that will reduce the emotional intensity of the feelings that they’re having, and that may include things like alcohol use.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The review echoes findings from Baldwin in the UK: “For fathers, distress may show up as anger, irritability, or conflict, and through avoidant behaviours like working excessively, smoking, gambling or increased focus on activities like sports or sex.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;When Macdonald and a team tracked a Covid cohort of dual copers, the study found higher rates of depression over time than among other fathers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“But everyone looks at them and thinks ‘Oh, you seem to be doing alright … We won’t dig any deeper,’” she says. “And my fear is that’s where we start to see risk for suicide.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="a19a9cc4-1d19-4d30-b94f-750dd23f4467" data-spacefinder-role="showcase" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement" class="dcr-5h0uf4"&gt;&lt;figcaption data-spacefinder-role="inline" class="dcr-16a696t"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1inf02i"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 18 13"&gt;&lt;path d="M18 3.5v8l-1.5 1.5h-15l-1.5-1.5v-8l1.5-1.5h3.5l2-2h4l2 2h3.5l1.5 1.5zm-9 7.5c1.9 0 3.5-1.6 3.5-3.5s-1.6-3.5-3.5-3.5-3.5 1.6-3.5 3.5 1.6 3.5 3.5 3.5z"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1qvd3m6"&gt;Men frequently take longer to bond with their babies than women.&lt;/span&gt; Illustration: Victoria Hart&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 id="egalitarian-dreams" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;Egalitarian dreams&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The way society expects fathers to engage in domestic life has undergone a fundamental shift within the last 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Couples before birth say what they want is a more egalitarian arrangement,” says Fletcher. “The community’s changed quite a bit but the system around dads hasn’t changed. That makes it hard for them to be clear about ‘Well, what’s my role, exactly?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The message to fathers about the role they are expected to play, from antenatal care to the way Australia structures parental leave, Fletcher says is: “Well, we think it’s pretty small.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure data-spacefinder-role="inline" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.NewsletterSignupBlockElement" class="dcr-173mewl"&gt;&lt;a data-ignore="global-link-styling" href="#EmailSignup-skip-link-32" class="dcr-jzxpee"&gt;skip past newsletter promotion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;aside aria-label="newsletter promotion" class="dcr-av5vqf"&gt;&lt;div class="dcr-10et71f"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1sbse14"&gt;Sign up to &lt;span&gt;Five Great Reads&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-1xjndtj"&gt;Each week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

This can make the transition to parenthood difficult for men. It is well established that men frequently take longer to bond with their babies than women. But the work of addressing that, says Fletcher, cannot be left up to individual men, operating in a vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“People think we’ve really got to get those dads to change their attitudes and be more egalitarian. That’s the task. Whereas I would say we’ve got to change the system surrounding conception, pregnancy and birth so that it’s assumed he’s part of it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Caring and earning dynamics established early in family life can be difficult to untangle, and can&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;cause long-term conflict when the reality of the division of caring does not cohere with the vision parents had when entering parenthood. Both parties can feel disappointed, says Fletcher – though women often more so, left literally holding the baby if their partner retreats into work, or hobbies, or alcohol as a way of coping with their own distress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The chasm between parents’ expectation and experience, between fathers’ needs and support, leaves families fumbling. They’re asking, says Macdonald: &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why does the system not respond to what we do as a family and what we need?” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“My hope is that we’re seeing a potential tipping point … where we see the family as a system; where we see both parents as providers, not just fathers, which means both parents are also protectors, both parents are carers, emotional caregivers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;But that needs intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="theyre-not-thinking-oh-what-about-me" class="dcr-12ibh7f"&gt;‘They’re not thinking, “Oh, what about me?”’&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The simple thing” that governments could do, says Fletcher, is screen new fathers for anxiety and depression. “I think that’s a basic fundamental thing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/02/nhs-to-introduce-mental-health-checks-for-new-fathers" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;NHS in the UK introduced screening for fathers&lt;/a&gt; by health visitors when their partners had already been identified as having perinatal mental health problems. Baldwin says it is a positive step, but is only part of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“What we really need is a broader cultural and systemic shift that normalises support for fathers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Often when one asks new fathers how they are doing, they are reluctant to identify that they are struggling. Their response, says Fletcher, is: “‘No, look after her.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;It is a mistake to attribute this to the father’s sense of the need to preserve a stoic masculinity, he argues. “The evidence says that they’re not so much thinking about that they want to be tough and super masculine, but they care for their partner.” They can see that their partner’s needs are most acute. “They’re not thinking, ‘Oh, what about me?’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This means the need for services which are specifically targeted towards fathers. A recent trial of an app which asked fathers to track their moods and offered cognitive behavioural therapy interventions, developed by Dr Sam Teague at James Cook University, found an improvement in fathers with anxiety, stress and even those with severe depression. Fathers also reported improved relationships with their partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Likewise Fletcher, with a team, developed a father-specific mobile-based information support service called SMS4dads which has more than 18,000 fathers signed up. A &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6796445/#:~:text=Four%20positive%20outcomes%20of%20SMS4dads,relationship%20with%20partners%20%5B41%5D." data-link-name="in body link"&gt;feasibility study for the service &lt;/a&gt;in 2019 found that fathers using the app improved their relationship with their baby and partner, and reduced their sense of isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Fletcher and Macdonald say the field of advocates and researchers invested in fatherhood is growing, but efforts to support fathers and their families are still often quite piecemeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Macdonald advocates using the universal GP system, and encouraging men in the early stages of fatherhood to attend routine mental and physical health checks – “just full-on dad checks across that period of time”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="9864e8c7-d6d6-4228-b43b-ee911399f6f0" data-spacefinder-role="richLink" data-spacefinder-type="model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement" class="dcr-1your1i"&gt;&lt;gu-island name="RichLinkComponent" priority="feature" deferuntil="idle" props='{"richLinkIndex":51,"element":{"_type":"model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.RichLinkBlockElement","prefix":"Related: ","text":"Why more men are joining the ranks of therapists: ‘We’re rushing to a place we’re needed’","elementId":"9864e8c7-d6d6-4228-b43b-ee911399f6f0","role":"richLink","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2023/dec/15/finding-male-therapists-mens-mental-health"},"ajaxUrl":"https://api.nextgen.guardianapps.co.uk","format":{"design":10,"display":2,"theme":0}}'&gt;&lt;/gu-island&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“A number of practitioners have told us they don’t feel as confident working with fathers, but once there’s training to do this, they feel very confident,” she says. One program working to skill up health practitioners, including GPs, &lt;a href="https://meninmind.movember.com/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Men in Mind&lt;/a&gt;, has recently been given funding to expand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Both Macdonald and Fletcher also say restructuring the parental leave system to allow fathers to be primary caregiver for a period is fundamental to the health of fathers and the families they are part of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-z9ge1j"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-15rw6c2"&gt;D&lt;/span&gt;ean Rogut’s son is now a teenager. With the passage of time, Rogut has become able to share his experience. For a few years, around the time of his son’s birthday, tensions would be high in his home, the relationship would struggle. Now, he is a community champion for &lt;a href="https://www.panda.org.au/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;perinatal mental health service Panda&lt;/a&gt;, and even as he trawls through the darkest of his memories, he comes across as confident, open.

He may have received support before he reached his crisis point. “It’s all those kinds of things that we look back on and think, ‘If only’.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 20:00:06 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxNVVpNOFlXaERnLWZaQkg3LWhXVGxfVkY0S1BiWmU3cnYwNGFiVUg3Q1Z3bHRBSzhNTnpXWlNVR3FOZF9KMDEzQlB1RUtPSFplLTkydXBFS25idGtCTGY5OXRBTDk4bVpRSkR3a3l5NHFwcS1xdzEyN2Z0TjZNSXMwWWRIT2FMcmFIRXczR05LUGNsY1RDTlo1UjVBZTEycGktbWFTbg</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，如果你患有糖尿病，你应该吃6种“坏”高蛋白食物来获得肌肉- EatingWell | 6 "Bad" High-Protein Foods You Should Eat to Gain Muscle If You Have Diabetes, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMikAFBVV95cUxOV2ZyOHRRcU1wX1drazNzNkQyd1ZOR3BqLTAwbnhVRGhlMXhlcXdkdWdHV2MxQlRZcWhzZld1VlAzb3ZkdTI2RnlhTk9LTmRKWHhfS3htWk1sR3VfQ0Y2Y3gzR2N4MWtsSTVXazVNQWJoZ0k5SUdlT3gxMlRWZmNRbzNQU01IOURTTGE3VFRQb2k?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-callout--summary mntl-sc-block-universal-callout--tips mntl-sc-block-universal-callout theme-summary callout--bordered" data-text="Key Points" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout" data-tracking-container="true"&gt;
&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein can help build muscle, improve insulin sensitivity and help manage blood sugar. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Some high-protein foods have been unfairly categorized as off-limits for diabetes. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dietitians say many of these muscle-building proteins may have diabetes benefits.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you’ve been diagnosed with diabetes, it can often feel like you’re on a diet of don'ts. A nagging voice in your head might constantly warn you away from a slew of foods that are high in sugar, carbs or even fat. Yet many foods traditionally thought of as “bad” for diabetes are actually loaded with &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-is-protein-and-its-benefits-11732679" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;high-quality protein&lt;/a&gt; that can help you build muscle. And since more muscle mass means better insulin sensitivity and a stronger,&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8053663/the-sneaky-way-diabetes-affects-metabolism-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt; faster metabolism&lt;/a&gt;, getting plenty of protein is a key part of a healthy diabetes diet.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; If you have diabetes and have been avoiding these protein-rich foods, dietitians say it’s time to welcome them back to the table.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Depending on the nutrition advice you’ve received, you might believe that eating anything but low-fat dairy is a big no-no for diabetes. But diabetes expert&lt;a href="https://erinpalinski.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; Erin Palinski-Wade, RD, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;, says a higher fat percentage in yogurt isn’t as worrisome as you might think. “People with diabetes are often told to opt for non-fat dairy,” she says. However, full-fat &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8015607/greek-yogurt-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;Greek yogurt's&lt;/a&gt; combo of slowly-digested fat plus roughly 21 grams of protein per cup can make it a filling option that helps &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291843/these-are-the-fastest-ways-to-stabilize-your-blood-sugar-if-you-have-diabetes/" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;stabilize blood sugar&lt;/a&gt;, she says.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In fact, some studies have shown people who consume more calories from dairy fat may have a lower risk of diabetes, especially when compared to calories from carbohydrates.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Gone are the days when health experts recommended steering clear of nuts due to their fat content. Current evidence shows that nuts are an excellent choice in a diabetes-friendly diet. One top-notch option:&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-eat-pistachios-regularly-8687923" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; pistachios&lt;/a&gt;.

A 2-ounce serving of pistachios delivers roughly 12 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; One small study found that volunteers with prediabetes who consumed 2 daily ounces of pistachios (1 ounce before breakfast and another ounce before dinner) for 12 weeks experienced improvements in blood sugar, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/habit-you-should-start-to-lose-visceral-fat-11698263#:~:text=Visceral%20fat%2C%20or%20belly%20fat,antioxidants%20and%20promoting%20gut%20health." class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;visceral fat&lt;/a&gt; and markers of heart health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Despite its generally positive reputation, shellfish has received criticism for its high cholesterol content, says&lt;a href="https://sheridietitian.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt; Sheri Gaw, RDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. This has led some people with diabetes (and, therefore, increased risk of heart disease) to avoid shellfish like crab, clams, shrimp and oysters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, Gaw says people with diabetes can say yes to shellfish on a regular basis. “Shellfish is a &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/swap-to-lower-risk-of-heart-disease-and-diabetes-8679543" link-destination-recommendation-ai="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;low-saturated fat&lt;/a&gt;, high-quality protein that promotes blood sugar control,” she explains. There’s more good news. One study found that two weekly servings of fish or shellfish may help protect people with a history of cardiovascular disease from future cardiac events and cardiovascular disease-related death.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Try a 3-ounce serving of canned crab for 15 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Believe it or not, beef can be beneficial for health, even for people with diabetes. It all comes down to choosing the right cut. While fatty cuts aren’t advised, Gaw says the high protein content of a&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7826527/500-calorie-beef-dinner-recipes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt; lean cut of beef&lt;/a&gt; like chuck, sirloin, round or top loin can help build muscle while keeping dietary fat to a minimum. Three ounces of trimmed sirloin steak, for example, contains roughly 17 grams of protein with a reasonable 3 grams of saturated fat.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Ever heard that soy is a bad actor for your health? While rumors abound that soy increases breast cancer risk, impairs mineral absorption or adversely affects male sex hormones, research has shown that these &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/myths-about-soy-you-need-to-stop-believing-11706042" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;soy myths&lt;/a&gt; simply aren’t true.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; ,&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Truth is, soy is actually a healthy choice for muscle-building, especially if you prefer a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7826129/plant-based-meal-plan-for-beginners/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based meal plan&lt;/a&gt;. “Soy foods are sometimes avoided for containing phytoestrogens and being processed, but foods like tofu are a great source of plant-based protein,” says diabetes expert&lt;a href="http://vandanasheth.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt; Vandana Sheth, RDN, CDCES&lt;/a&gt;. “Tofu contains all the essential amino acids and supports muscle growth without blood sugar spikes.” One cup of cubed &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/gallery/7904929/tofu-recipes-for-beginners/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="3"&gt;tofu&lt;/a&gt; contains an impressive 18 grams of protein.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to diabetes, there’s a lot of confusion around beans and lentils. Their relatively high carb content can give the impression that they’re off-limits for people with blood sugar issues. But Shah says these legumes have a unique saving grace, specifically their fiber. “While they are higher in carbs, they have a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/low-glycemic-diet-vs-low-carb-diet-which-is-healthier-8559250" class="pseudoStyle" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;lower glycemic load&lt;/a&gt; because of their high fiber content,” she explains. This means they won’t raise your blood sugar quickly. In fact, many dietitians consider beans to be among &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7994446/best-high-fiber-foods-for-diabetes/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;the best high-fiber foods for diabetes&lt;/a&gt;. Try a cup of cooked lentils for 18 grams of plant-based protein plus a bonus 16 grams of blood sugar-regulating fiber.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Research has found that reducing visceral fat may promote better insulin sensitivity.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Research reveals that lean protein may help build muscle, manage weight, and improve insulin sensitivity and blood sugar control. Dietitians say that some of the high-protein foods people with diabetes sometimes avoid–such as full-fat yogurt, nuts, shellfish, beef, soy, beans and lentils—can actually be a part of a healthy eating plan for diabetes and can help build the muscle you need.

&lt;p&gt;Late-night scrolling isn’t the only thing sabotaging your slumber.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-025-08090-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;New research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that a common daily habit may send your brain into overdrive while you sleep — even if you do it hours before bedtime.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists warn the disruption could interfere with the brain’s overnight recovery processes, potentially taking a toll on your &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/04/health/why-tossing-and-turning-at-night-could-increase-risk-of-cognitive-decline-study/"&gt;cognitive health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Caffeine is a stimulant that can make it hard to fall asleep, but it might also affect your brain once you doze off.   &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Rido – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the study, Canadian researchers had 40 healthy adults spend two nonconsecutive nights in a sleep lab.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On one night, participants consumed 200 milligrams of caffeine — the equivalent of about two cups of coffee — a few hours before bed. On the other, they were given a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;While most people know caffeine can &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/13/health/sleep-expert-says-drinking-coffee-after-noon-causes-insomnia/"&gt;make it harder to fall asleep&lt;/a&gt;, researchers used EEG scans to track brain activity after participants dozed off and found it kept their brains in a heightened state of alertness long after they shut their eyes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They found, for the first time, that the stimulant pushed the brain into a state of “criticality,” making it more awake, alert and reactive than it should be while catching Zzz’s.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“While this is useful during the day for concentration, this state could interfere with rest at night: the brain would neither relax nor recover properly,” &lt;a href="https://nouvelles.umontreal.ca/en/article/2025/05/29/how-does-coffee-affect-a-sleeping-brain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Dr. &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Julie-Carrier-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Julie Carrier&lt;/a&gt;, a psychology professor at the University of Montreal and co-author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The majority of Americans drink at least one caffeinated beverage daily.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;sebra – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team used artificial intelligence to detect subtle changes in neuronal activity and found that caffeine increased the complexity of brain signals, preventing the brain from fully powering down during sleep.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The effect was especially strong during non-REM sleep — the deep stage critical for memory and cognitive recovery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers also observed changes in brain wave patterns. Slow waves linked to deep, restorative rest were reduced, while faster waves associated with wakefulness and mental activity increased.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These changes suggest that even during sleep, the brain remains in a more activated, less restorative state under the influence of caffeine,” said&lt;a href="http://www.karimjerbi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt; Dr. Karim Jerbi&lt;/a&gt;, a psychology professor at the University of Montreal and researcher at the Mila Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute, who co-authored the study.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This change in the brain’s rhythmic activity may help explain why caffeine affects the efficiency with which the brain recovers during the night, with potential consequences for &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/14/health/sleep-could-help-erase-bad-memories-therapy-for-our-emotions/#!"&gt;memory processing&lt;/a&gt;,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Caffeine increased neural activity during sleep and suppressed slow waves linked to deep, restorative rest.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Maryna – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Notably, the stimulant’s effect’s were far more pronounced in participants aged 20 to 27 compared to those aged 41 to 58 — especially during REM sleep, the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/18/health/why-its-easier-for-some-people-to-remember-dreams-than-others/"&gt;dreaming phase&lt;/a&gt; tied to emotional and cognitive processing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers believe younger adults responded more strongly due to having more adenosine receptors. These molecules gradually accumulate in the brain throughout the day, triggering fatigue. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Adenosine receptors naturally decrease with age, reducing caffeine’s ability to block them and improve brain complexity, which may partly explain the reduced effect of caffeine observed in middle-aged participants,” Carrier said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest younger brains may be especially vulnerable to caffeine’s hidden impact on rest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Caffiene might have an event greater impact on the sleeping brain’s of young people.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Svitlana – stock.adobe.com&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychoactive drug in the world, commonly found in products such as coffee, tea, chocolate, sodas and energy drinks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-news/94-percent-of-us-drink-caffeinated-beverages" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2023 Sleep Foundation survey&lt;/a&gt; found that 94% of US adults consume caffeinated beverages, and 64% drink them daily. Of those, 40% said they didn’t think it affected their sleep.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/spilling-beans-how-much-caffeine-too-much" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;While the &lt;/a&gt;FDA says up to 400 milligrams of caffeine per day is generally safe for healthy adults, the study suggests it could still be interfering with sleep quality — even hours after your last sip.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The scientists are calling for further research exploring how these nighttime brain changes affect day-to-day functioning and cognitive health. This, they said, could one day shape personalized caffeine recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

However, he said the feeling had spread to his toes by the following day, and he was feeling an overall listlessness in his body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was carrying my eldest down the stairs and I just felt weak, and I thought I was going to drop him,” the father of two told the outlet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His partner, Alix, 31, insisted that he go to the local emergency room, where he was diagnosed with &lt;a href="https://people.com/health/surviving-guillain-barre-syndrome-people-writer/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Guillain-Barré Syndrome;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Guillain-Barré Syndrome&lt;/a&gt; (GBS) — a rare condition in which the immune system attacks a person’s nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pickering did not leave the hospital for 94 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcus Brandt/picture alliance via Getty &lt;/p&gt; A hospital worker pushing bed (stock image)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I thought I'd be coming back out soon, but as the week progressed, I just got weaker and weaker.

However, his health continued to deteriorate and he was transferred to the intensive care unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I could feel myself getting worse. I prepared myself to say my goodbyes to my family, but I wasn't willing to say it. I just said, ‘See you later,’ ” he told The Independent, adding that Alix brought their 2-year-old son and newborn baby to visit every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I was really hard on myself at the time, but the only way I was going to be happy was by getting home. I was determined to get out and walk again,” he recalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third round of IVIG was successful, and Pickering was transferred out of the ICU and into a rehabilitation center just before Christmas 2023. He was able to walk again by February 2024, though he noted that it wasn’t an easy path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I knew my body wasn’t ready for it, but you just have to keep doing it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty&lt;/p&gt; A man in physical therapy (stock image)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pickering — who said he still can’t feel his toes — has been home for about a year and is able to live life mostly normally these days. However, he said that the small chance that the condition &lt;a href="https://people.com/colin-egglesfield-says-life-hasn-t-been-the-easiest-as-he-reveals-his-cancer-has-returned-for-a-third-time-8779547" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:could return;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;could return&lt;/a&gt; keeps him up at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If I wake up in the middle of the night with pins and needles, that's it. I'm awake all night because I think it's happening again,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his experience, Pickering became a brand ambassador and volunteer for the &lt;a href="https://nationalrehabilitationcentre.nhs.uk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:National Rehabilitation Centre (NRC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;National Rehabilitation Centre (NRC&lt;/a&gt;), a new 70-bed rehabilitation facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I just wanted to give back.

For most people, body weakness typically peaks around three weeks after the initial onset of symptoms and then begins to improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GBS usually affects people between the ages of 30 and 50, and often occurs after a viral infection, which in turn triggers an overactive immune response in the patient, according to the clinic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/fathers-tingling-hands-ends-in-him-becoming-paralyzed-guillain-barre-syndrome-11745985" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 19:01:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidEFVX3lxTE00RURhcE1PdXZSR191SHRLYzlHMTdTemh1aTExN2ZrUWpfYVJMMVpaWDY1bTRCNENXQy1iMXRXb0tRbDJobXdnVUVMeElHLTVfendDd0lFWlE2SjVXcTFVU2FUcDdTYVlyeFpaMlBGRHF5OV9l</guid></item><item><title>抗击影响数百万人的致命疾病的疫苗竞赛遭受毁灭性打击-每日邮报 | Devastating blow in race for vaccine against deadly disease that affects millions - Daily Mail</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxOSnhNSWJHSVJlSnN1Qlg4NGItRVlzTzg3Rkx5VUNhQlFINHNPVjlVd0YyNTlVMmU2c3drRElZUWwtQlh6N292T253QlVKeV9jSVBhVTVGOHdIM01neWVGblJLb3hBXzVnaDNGVml5OTZEblJWOTloVUk0R3pmZUxrOHJSUGlYNlFEcGg0Sm1Sa9IBlAFBVV95cUxNR1k2VDhKcjFJbEJ4WE9XMVpIalRuVWFNWTJlRnU5V2xxVjZKN1NWbDgyRHg0eDNEUjctX05Zb0FSOXFQSHZrOVF3RU1oYWNTako0U2R1dXV4T3ZHWldQcGhvRkxMaWM2azBCNnJJbnBOUV9pbU40LXlJV2pfRDgtMzR4T29uWWNDYXlVbEFCSFVrWlI5?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A major US research program to develop a vaccine against &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/hiv_aids/index.html" id="mol-17de64a0-3e4d-11f0-ac40-af30899e520e"&gt;HIV&lt;/a&gt; has been abruptly canceled by the Trump administration, sparking outrage as prevention efforts stall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The administration's termination of the promising $258million research program stunned scientists, whose years-long project had also benefited the development of treatments for &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/coronavirus/index.html" id="mol-9dfe22d0-3e27-11f0-bc91-d9624054564a"&gt;COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;, autoimmune conditions, and even snakebite antivenom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers at Duke University and the Scripps Research Institute were informed on Friday that their funding would be cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The consortia for HIV/AIDS vaccine development and immunology was reviewed by &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/northern-ireland/index.html" id="mol-9dfc4e10-3e27-11f0-bc91-d9624054564a" class="class"&gt;NIH&lt;/a&gt; leadership, which does not support it moving forward,' a senior official, who asked not to be named, told the &lt;a class="class" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/health/trump-hiv-cuts.html"&gt;New York Times&lt;/a&gt;. 'NIH expects to be shifting its focus toward using currently available approaches to eliminate HIV/AIDS.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I find it very disappointing that at this critical juncture the funding for highly successful HIV vaccine research programs should be pulled,' Dennis Burton, an immunologist who led the program at Scripps, told the New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;More than 1.2million people in the US have HIV with the figure standing at around 110,000 in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Donald Trump cutting funding for the HIV vaccine is as mind blowing as it heart breaking', said Richard Angell, chief executive of HIV charity the Terrence Higgins Trust. 'The holy grail of any virus response and the only things that will eventually keep all Americans safe  is a vaccine.

The NIH has also paused funding for a separate clinical trial of an HIV vaccine developed by &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/moderna/index.html" id="mol-9df76c10-3e27-11f0-bc91-d9624054564a"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;HIV rates remain high.

In Texas, the state's Department of Health Services told grantees to pause HIV prevention activities 'until further notice.' In Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, 10 health department staffers have been laid off. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Across Africa, several countries are reporting major disruptions in prevention work after delays in US aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The HIV pandemic will never be ended without a vaccine, so killing research on one will end up killing people,' John Moore, an HIV researcher at Weill Cornell Medical College, said.

The research shows that adults with ADHD are more likely to struggle with education, employment, and overall social functioning compared to those without the condition. Even when individuals adhered to prescribed medication over a 10-year period, their outcomes did not significantly improve in key areas such as educational attainment or employment by the age of 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ADHD is a developmental condition that affects about 2–3% of children, with symptoms often continuing into adulthood. It is characterized by persistent patterns of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. These behaviors can make it difficult to succeed in academic, social, and workplace settings. While medication is commonly prescribed to manage symptoms, the long-term effects of treatment on real-world outcomes like education and employment have not been well studied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers set out to understand how adults with ADHD are doing by age 30, and whether sticking to prescribed medication during young adulthood helps improve social outcomes. They also aimed to quantify the broader social and economic impact of ADHD, particularly in terms of healthcare costs and the presence of other mental health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team used national data from Denmark’s health and social registries to track individuals diagnosed with ADHD between 1995 and 2016. To be included, patients had to be under 30 years old by 2005 or turn 30 by 2016, which allowed for at least a decade of follow-up data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, 4,897 people with ADHD were matched with 18,931 individuals from the general population. Matching was based on age, gender, and location. The researchers then compared the two groups across a range of outcomes, including education level, employment status, income, healthcare use, and psychiatric comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also examined medication adherence by tracking how consistently ADHD patients filled prescriptions over the 10 years leading up to age 30. Adherence was defined as receiving at least 70% of the defined daily dose in a given year. The researchers then analyzed whether greater adherence led to better social and economic outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, adults with ADHD fared significantly worse than their peers in many areas of life by the time they reached 30. Compared to the control group, individuals with ADHD were more likely to live alone, less likely to have completed higher education, less likely to be employed, more likely to rely on social welfare programs, and more likely to have been diagnosed with additional psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At age 30, only about 35% of adults with ADHD were employed, compared to over 74% in the control group. A striking 34% of those with ADHD were receiving social security benefits, and 12% were on disability pensions — much higher than their non-ADHD peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economic picture was also sobering. Adults with ADHD had lower predicted income from employment and significantly higher healthcare costs. On average, they received more than double the amount of public financial support compared to the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mental health was another key difference. Psychiatric comorbidities were far more common among ADHD patients, including depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders. These additional conditions strongly influenced outcomes: people with more severe psychiatric comorbidities were much less likely to finish school or be employed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the central questions of the study was whether sticking to ADHD medication made a difference. Surprisingly, the answer was no — or at least not in the expected way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adherence to medication between the ages of 21 and 30 did not increase the chances of completing a vocational or college-level education. Nor did it boost the odds of being employed at age 30. In fact, higher adherence to medication was modestly associated with lower odds of being employed, although the researchers believe this may be due to the fact that people with more severe symptoms — and thus worse outcomes — are also the ones who are more likely to stay on medication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Educational outcomes were most strongly predicted by whether the patient’s parents had higher levels of education. Similarly, parental education also influenced whether the individual was employed by age 30. This suggests that family background remains a powerful driver of success, even among those with access to medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers acknowledged several limitations. One key issue is that the data do not capture the full range of non-medication treatments, such as therapy, special education services, or social support programs. These may play an important role in long-term success but were not included in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another challenge is that the study design was observational, which means it cannot prove causation. For example, while medication adherence was not linked to better outcomes, this does not mean that medication is ineffective — it may be that the people who need it most already face serious disadvantages that medication alone cannot overcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also limited information about the age at which patients were first diagnosed. Many participants received their diagnosis as adults, missing out on early intervention that might have changed their life trajectories. The researchers note that earlier diagnosis and a combination of treatments might lead to better long-term results, but more studies are needed to test this idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2025.01.016" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Long-term effects of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) on social functioning and health care outcomes&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Poul Jennum, Anne Virring Sørensen, Lone Baandrup, Michael Ibsen, Rikke Ibsen, and Jakob Kjellberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>PsyPost</author><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 18:03:24 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivAFBVV95cUxNZTcwbGpDaXNPaElzR2pEcWprM2d4QU9YX19SbEs1Q29tWlV3TGlFc0I3U0ZOcTdmVUhEanBkNDgwWWhXZWFCS2x6Zk96eTJ5NXFqVVNYcmhHU1BkMHNpVUlvT3QzMlVCVW9HMlh2SHpRcUhlYnFRRi1ZMC11SGo2MVBFelpRM0p1VGxlckpoZ3BBOWNGOEhPN2VReWJDNjZXSjExb1V3Y2xSWEdjZzdKWGhSbENYbHp3VURJZQ</guid></item><item><title>TikTok上最常见的心理健康错误信息是什么？ -《卫报》 | What is the most common mental health misinformation on TikTok? - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiswFBVV95cUxNNmYzclVabWt1RlAwaFJnQzl0UlJIeUQwMDlHdjAyNXZhdl80Nl95VE9MZkVjcVRRUm9tRkRZalh5cXpjbHdhZ2lTWEdKOWZpRndqZXMzVWZYZUNVVTUtTG1UMWhwX05tbDNzYWhtZ1FrQkxlNzVsM1JTXzl1NzIwZEdQVjJ3Y1ROVEZycDdkLUdTQ1Bsd2tZMjFodVp5YzRMRy0wdk95QmE0UDRUQ1ZtcndBdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol data-ignore="global-ol-styling"&gt;&lt;li data-spacefinder-role="nested" class="dcr-566m6o"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-dhro9s"&gt;&lt;h2 id="pathologising-normal-emotions" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1378exm"&gt;1. &lt;/span&gt;Pathologising normal emotions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Several videos about borderline personality disorder suggest symptoms that are everyday experiences – such as feeling anxiety when people change plans, experiencing mood swings, a fear of abandonment and mirroring people’s behaviour to be liked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Another video purports to show how depression manifests in the workplace as a lack of concentration, feeling tired, having low energy levels, a loss of appetite and irritability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“While some of the ‘symptoms’ overlap with depression, these can be attributed to a range of afflictions and struggles,” said Liam Modlin, a therapist and psychology researcher at King’s College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-spacefinder-role="nested" class="dcr-566m6o"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-dhro9s"&gt;&lt;h2 id="misusing-therapeutic-language" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1378exm"&gt;2. &lt;/span&gt;Misusing therapeutic language&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One video said that people with bipolar disorder experience mood swings because their emotional pendulum swings more widely and rapidly than most. However this is a misunderstanding, since people experience extended mood changes over periods of weeks rather than rapid “mood swings”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This is an example of misappropriating a mental health diagnosis to wrongly explain or justify behaviour,” said Dan Poulter, a former health minister and NHS psychiatrist. “A person with bipolar disorder may find this trivialising of their experience of living with a debilitating and serious mental illness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Another popular video suggests that when someone is about to die by suicide they become “almost bipolar” – “language [that] can further stigmatise mental health”, said Prof Rina Dutta, a consultant psychiatrist and psychiatry professor at King’s College London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Another video claims signs of abuse are constantly apologising; breaking down during small disagreements; needing reassurance; struggling to be open; being hypersensitive to criticism, and hiding feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“The behaviours it describes, while potentially present in abusive dynamics, are not exclusive to abuse and may occur in a variety of other contexts,” said Modlin. “By presenting these signs without sufficient context or diagnostic nuance, the video risks encouraging viewers to self-diagnose or mislabel complex relational struggles as abuse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-spacefinder-role="nested" class="dcr-566m6o"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-dhro9s"&gt;&lt;h2 id="unevidenced-treatments-and-false-claims" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1378exm"&gt;3. &lt;/span&gt;Unevidenced treatments and false claims&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;This was the most common form of misinformation contained in the videos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;One video promotes a method it said was cheaper than therapy and had fewer side effects than antidepressants that could enable people “to heal from trauma in an hour” and involved writing about the traumatic experiences for 15 minutes non-stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“No research suggests this is sufficient for cure, definitely not in an hour, and there is risk of independently forcing oneself back into this traumatic mindset without the support of an experienced therapist,” said Amber Johnston, an accredited psychotherapist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Another clip suggests that crying is self-soothing and good for processing emotions, including by stimulating the release of cortisol. “Cortisol changes related to crying are complex and cannot be distilled down in this way,” said Amy Durden, a psychotherapist. “Crying can bring relief but not always. It can be self-soothing but if the person crying judges their crying negatively, they do not experience this benefit and may feel acute shame.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Several videos featured glib quotations that the experts viewed as unhelpful such as: “If you’re not changing, you’re choosing”, while another popular quotation said: “When you feel like everyone hates you, sleep. When you feel like you hate everyone, eat. When you feel like you hate yourself, shower. And when you feel like everyone hates everyone, go outside.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This is a huge oversimplification of how to address complex emotional states,” said Durden. “It seems to be pulling from behavioural activation in CBT, but without any context or individualisation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;A specific breathing technique for treating anxiety was promoted in another video. “There is no single, universally effective breathing technique that is helpful in all cases,” said David Okai, a consultant neuropsychiatrist. “If performed incorrectly, the exercises can be the equivalent of hyperventilation, which can be extremely unpleasant and exacerbate anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Another video suggests depression is caused by alcohol, tobacco, MSG, caffeine, sugar and hydrolysed wheat. Modlin said that although lifestyle factors can contribute, “this framing is overly simplistic and potentially misleading”, since there are complex interwoven factors, including genetics and neurobiology, psychosocial stressors, childhood adversity, medical conditions and personality styles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Other clips promote supplements including saffron, magnesium glycinate and holy basil extract to ease anxiety. Although the psychiatrist Famia Askari said there are some studies showing benefits to some of these, there is not sufficient consensus for these to have become part of clinical practice – they are also manufactured supplements, in contrast to the “natural” claims that featured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li data-spacefinder-role="nested" class="dcr-566m6o"&gt;&lt;hr class="dcr-dhro9s"&gt;&lt;h2 id="anecdotal-evidence" class="dcr-bry4uv"&gt;&lt;span class="dcr-1378exm"&gt;4. &lt;/span&gt;Anecdotal evidence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Two videos recommend admission to psychiatric units based on personal experience, including one suggesting someone had considerably improved after six days, and another offering a template for children to ask their parents to have them admitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Poulter said this was “misleading” and can “create misconceptions” about the benefits of inpatient admission. “Inpatient admission can in fact create and reinforce maladaptive coping mechanisms,” he said. “It is also very rare that someone would be driving themselves into mental health hospital in the way depicted by the video.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Another video depicts someone in a hospital gown in what appears to be a psychiatric ward stating: “I was too honest with my psychiatrist.” This could be harmful as it is “potentially encouraging people to not be honest and open with healthcare professionals about their mental health”, said Poulter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In another clip, a woman gives her strategies for managing anxiety, including eating an orange in the shower. “There is no evidence-base for eating citrus in the shower as a means to reducing anxiety, and I would worry that this would lead on to an ever-increasing spiral of unusual behaviours,” said Okai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 18:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNNmYzclVabWt1RlAwaFJnQzl0UlJIeUQwMDlHdjAyNXZhdl80Nl95VE9MZkVjcVRRUm9tRkRZalh5cXpjbHdhZ2lTWEdKOWZpRndqZXMzVWZYZUNVVTUtTG1UMWhwX05tbDNzYWhtZ1FrQkxlNzVsM1JTXzl1NzIwZEdQVjJ3Y1ROVEZycDdkLUdTQ1Bsd2tZMjFodVp5YzRMRy0wdk95QmE0UDRUQ1ZtcndBdw</guid></item><item><title>传染病更新2025年5月31日-每日科斯 | Infectious Updates 5/31/2025 - Daily Kos</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMihwFBVV95cUxNVUstcTdVTnZsSGFRSFlBZjI3b2N1UHFNZ1VtQXVZQ0hvWkFUMm1mQkQ0elZrbVI5cHFnRk85MVBjY2s0Zi1wS0tsa1dnWFJuU0dxTlNwUlNldl91bmhIbUdZNHdUZ3E3OVVJSmRXYy1ZNWh6bk9CT0NBb19tc2xrYU5VRlg5R0U?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="story__text"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canada has 2515 cases and counting rapidly, more than twice the confirmed measles cases as the US.  Alberta &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/southern-alberta-measles-cases-tip-of-iceberg-1.7546237" target="_blank" title=""&gt;has 654 confirmed,&lt;/a&gt; concentrated in the south, and doctors report that the patients they see are reporting that other family members have had it recently and not gone to a doctor, so the actual total is much worse. In many ways, Alberta is Canada’s Texas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexico was over 1500 cases at last report, but up-to-date figures are hard to come by.  &lt;a href="https://disa.org/measles-outbreak-challenges-mexico-amidst-public-distrust-and-misinformation/" target="_blank"&gt;They are working hard against misinformation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Measles vaccination rates often do not remain high enough, worldwide, and the Covid pandemic disrupted efforts, which have not recovered in any WHO region. &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-025-01198-3" target="_blank"&gt;Nature.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In practice, however, vaccination coverage often plateaus or declines after substantial initial gains (Supplementary Fig. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-025-01198-3#MOESM1" target="_blank"&gt;1a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;), leaving many countries stalled in moderate control regimes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-025-01198-3#ref-CR4" target="_blank"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;. As a result, resurgence occurs, for example, in 2018–2019, large outbreaks affected several locations including Ukraine, Madagascar and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The COVID-19 pandemic further disrupted control efforts, and as of 2023 no WHO region has regained its pre-pandemic vaccination coverage levels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-025-01198-3#ref-CR3" target="_blank"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;. Consequently, 36 countries experienced large and disruptive outbreaks in 2022, rising to 57 countries in 2023 (ref.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-025-01198-3#ref-CR5" target="_blank"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/norovirus/norovirus-vaccine-produces-mucosal-immunity-phase-2b-trial" target="_blank"&gt;working norovirus vaccine may be on the horizon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;H5N1 continues to simmer, no further shoes have dropped as far as the virus. &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/cambodia-logs-fourth-fatal-h5n1-avian-flu-case-year" target="_blank" title=""&gt;Cambodia reports its fourth fatal case this year&lt;/a&gt;. China had a human case that recovered.  The US is up to 1072 dairy herds affected, and a few more poultry farms added this week. Workers are not being routinely tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So of course, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/28/nx-s1-5414642/trump-vaccine-bird-flu-mrna?utm_id=75768454&amp;amp;orgid=&amp;amp;uniquet=&amp;amp;utm_att1=" target="_blank"&gt;The Tfump admin has cancelled Moderna's contract to develop a vaccine.&lt;/a&gt;  They really want us to die, don't they? RFKJr wants to &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/covid-19/rfk-jr-says-no-covid-vaccines-healthy-children-pregnant-women" target="_blank" title=""&gt;Deny Covid vaccines to healthy children and pregnant women&lt;/a&gt;, despite pregnancy being a high-risk condition for severe disease.  And he wants Moderna and Pfizer to put on their labels that myocarditis is a "common" adverse event which it %$#@ing well isn't.  Disinformation!&lt;/p&gt;

He was unusually lethargic and struggled with breathing. Blood tests revealed dangerously high levels of ammonia, and further testing confirmed a deficiency in the CPS1 enzyme — an extremely rare genetic disorder where one in two patients dies within the first few months of life. Those who survive often experience developmental delays and intellectual disabilities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="cdjrf-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="cdjrf-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="cdjrf-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Once diagnosed, KJ’s doctors immediately began a race to develop a personalized gene therapy to correct the specific error in his genetic code. Remarkably, they succeeded in just six months, making young Muldoon the first person ever to receive a gene-editing therapy tailored exclusively for him. This achievement paves the way for personalized gene therapies for rare genetic disorders that are currently deemed untreatable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="celj1-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide firstImageInArticle firstImageInArticleBody"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.B1lPI9jOzlx" id="image_ArticleImageData.B1lPI9jOzlx"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.B1lPI9jOzlx" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/05/15/SyGpsGCmWgl/SyGpsGCmWgl_0_0_1280_854_0_x-large.jpg" alt="חייו של התינוק קיי-ג'יי מולדון ניצלו בזכות טיפול באמצעות עריכה גנטית" title="Baby KJ is the first person in the world to undergo personalized gene therapy using base editing technology  (Photo: Children's Hospital of Philadelphia) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="mobileView"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.B1lPI9jOzlx" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/05/15/SyGpsGCmWgl/SyGpsGCmWgl_0_0_1280_854_0_x-large.jpg" alt="חייו של התינוק קיי-ג'יי מולדון ניצלו בזכות טיפול באמצעות עריכה גנטית" title="Baby KJ is the first person in the world to undergo personalized gene therapy using base editing technology  (Photo: Children's Hospital of Philadelphia) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="ImageDetails"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCaption"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Baby KJ is the first person in the world to undergo personalized gene therapy using base editing technology &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCredit"&gt;(&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Photo: Children's Hospital of Philadelphia&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="710s5-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="710s5-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="710s5-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;KJ, the fourth child of Kyle and Nicole Muldoon, was born a few weeks early in Pennsylvania and initially appeared healthy. However, shortly after birth, he began showing symptoms that led doctors to suspect meningitis or sepsis — a severe and life-threatening response to a blood infection. Thanks to the vigilance of his caregivers, dangerously high levels of ammonia were detected in his blood, and the doctors quickly realized that his critical condition was not caused by an infection.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="c9t0e-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="c9t0e-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="c9t0e-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The infant was transferred to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), where the medical team began treatment to remove the excess ammonia from his body. At the hospital, KJ’s genome was sequenced, revealing a defect in both copies of the gene responsible for producing the CPS1 enzyme. This meant his body could not produce the enzyme, which plays a crucial role in the urea cycle — the body's process of eliminating ammonia, a toxic byproduct of protein breakdown, by converting it into urea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="7l32m-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="7l32m-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="7l32m-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;In healthy individuals, ammonia is converted into urea in the liver, enters the bloodstream and is then filtered by the kidneys and excreted in the urine. But for those lacking a functioning CPS1 enzyme, ammonia accumulates in the body to toxic levels. This condition is life-threatening because ammonia is especially harmful to nerve cells and can cause brain damage, coma and death. It is also an extremely rare condition, affecting only one in every 1.3 million newborns.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="a566k-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="a566k-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="a566k-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Treatment for CPS1 deficiency typically involves reducing protein intake in the patient’s diet and administering medications that help eliminate ammonia — until the child is old enough for a liver transplant with a functioning urea cycle. However, during this time, spikes in ammonia levels — such as those triggered by infections — can lead to irreversible brain damage or death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="a30np-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="a30np-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="a30np-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“When we Googled CPS1 deficiency, we saw there were two likely outcomes – a liver transplant or death,” said Nicole, KJ’s mother. “We were in shock.” Faced with this devastating reality, she and her partner decided to keep KJ hospitalized for as long as necessary, so he could receive round-the-clock care to maximize his chances of survival. Due to his critical condition, KJ was placed on the liver transplant waiting list at just five months old — a transplant that might arrive too late.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="2rlr9-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="66s6i-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="66s6i-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="66s6i-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Meanwhile, KJ’s medical team began working on a potential treatment that might be able to repair one of the defective copies of his gene in the liver. Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas, a physician and researcher at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and Kiran Musunuru, a doctor and geneticist at the University of Pennsylvania, along with their colleagues, described the race to develop the gene therapy in a paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="bmo9-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="bmo9-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="bmo9-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Ahrens-Nicklas and Musunuru have been collaborating for several years in an effort to find ways to correct genetic errors — mutations — in the livers of children suffering from urea cycle disorders. Their focus was on base editing, a CRISPR-based gene-editing enables the alteration of a single base, or “letter”, in DNA. The CRISPR system, which scientists began using only in the past decade, has revolutionized genetic engineering. It enables easy and rapid gene editing and is often described as "genetic scissors" that cut both strands of the DNA. In contrast, base editing is more like using an eraser and pencil — it makes a small nick in one DNA strand, enabling the replacement of a single base.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="c35i8-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="c35i8-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="c35i8-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;To help children born with urea cycle disorders, mutations must be corrected as early as possible, before irreversible damage occurs. To that end, Ahrens-Nicklas and Musunuru developed a workflow to accelerate the production of a personalized base-editing system from the moment a patient’s disease-causing mutation is identified. The researchers had practiced the process, selecting a known genetic error that causes a urea cycle disorder and working as fast as possible to develop a suitable editor. In each trial, they managed to reduce the time required to find a solution — from over a year to just a few months.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="5260b-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="5260b-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="5260b-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;KJ’s mutation was the seventh they attempted to rapidly correct — but this time, it wasn’t just a lab exercise. This time, it was a real, sick baby.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="6nver-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="6nver-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="6nver-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Ahrens-Nicklas, Musunuru and their team — in collaboration with researchers from the Innovative Genomics Institute (IGI) at the University of California, Berkeley, several biotechnology companies and with federal funding from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) — developed a gene therapy for KJ in record time. They worked almost nonstop, including through holidays. By the time KJ was one month old, the researchers had already grown cell cultures carrying his specific mutation to test the treatment. A month later, they had a working base-editing system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="96atv-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.BJgxacidGll" id="image_ArticleImageData.BJgxacidGll"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.BJgxacidGll" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/05/20/Syc2Oz511ll/Syc2Oz511ll_0_0_3000_1800_0_x-large.jpg" alt="עריכת DNA" title="CRISPR  (Illustration: Shutterstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="mobileView"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.BJgxacidGll" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/05/20/Syc2Oz511ll/Syc2Oz511ll_0_0_3000_1800_0_x-large.jpg" alt="עריכת DNA" title="CRISPR  (Illustration: Shutterstock) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="ImageDetails"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCaption"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;CRISPR &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCredit"&gt;(&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Illustration: Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="67thd-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="67thd-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="67thd-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The system is encased in a tiny fatty bubble (lipid nanoparticle) that protects it and helps it enter liver cells. Inside the bubble are the instructions for producing the editor, along with a small genetic sequence (gRNA) that guides the editor precisely to the location where the incorrect letter in one copy of KJ’s gene needs to be corrected. This sequence was named “kayjayguran” after the baby.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="chrra-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="chrra-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="chrra-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;COVID-19 vaccines use similar lipid bubbles, though they don’t carry instructions to alter genetic sequences.

The treatment successfully corrected the mutation. However, as it often happens with the CRISPR system, it also caused some unintended changes in other regions of the DNA. Fortunately, testing showed that these off-target genetic changes did not cause harm. It is similar in a way to correcting a typo in the sentence “Cats have many supestitions,” so it reads “Kats have many superstitions” after the correction. The change outside the word “superstitions” doesn’t alter the meaning of the sentence and, therefore, is harmless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="a8mo8-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="a8mo8-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="a8mo8-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;At the same time, the researchers were also testing the therapy’s safety in a macaque monkey. When KJ was six months old, the researchers submitted the test results and an application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval of the therapy as an investigational new drug for a single patient. The FDA approved the request within a week, and several biotech companies collaborated to produce the treatment at cost and at a quality suitable for human use.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="2oqmd-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="2oqmd-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="2oqmd-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Once the researchers knew they had an approved treatment, Ahrens-Nicklas finally told KJ’s parents that she might have good news. “My biggest fear in all of this was giving false hope to a family,” she said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="6ad7s-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.SJeHJsoOzxe" id="image_ArticleImageData.SJeHJsoOzxe"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.SJeHJsoOzxe" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/05/20/S1g53uMcZgx/S1g53uMcZgx_0_0_1000_667_0_x-large.jpg" alt="עריכת DNA" title="Illustration: Shutterstock" aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="mobileView"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.SJeHJsoOzxe" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/05/20/S1g53uMcZgx/S1g53uMcZgx_0_0_1000_667_0_x-large.jpg" alt="עריכת DNA" title="Illustration: Shutterstock" aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="ImageDetails"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCaption"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCredit"&gt;(&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Illustration: Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="55ncq-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="55ncq-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="55ncq-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Nicole and Kyle chose to go ahead with the treatment. “Our child was sick.

In March and late April, he received two more infusions at higher doses. His condition improved almost immediately: he was able to eat more protein, his medication dose was cut in half and even viral infections didn’t cause spikes in his blood ammonia levels — a typical reaction for patients like him. He also gained weight, jumping from the 7th percentile just before the first infusion to the 40th percentile now, at 9.5 months old. In addition, KJ is currently no longer on the liver transplant list, although it’s still uncertain if he might need one in the future.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="b6977-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="b6977-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="b6977-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The treatment did not cure him, but it significantly reduced the severity of his disease. “While KJ will need to be monitored carefully for the rest of his life, our initial findings are quite promising,” Ahrens-Nicklas said in a press release.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="4gpp9-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="4gpp9-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="4gpp9-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Only a few weeks have passed since his last infusion, and it’s still too early to determine whether KJ’s improvement will be sustained over time, whether there will be any long-term side effects, or whether he will eventually be able to stop taking ammonia-clearing medications. Additionally, there is no way to determine the exact success rate of the gene editing in KJ’s liver or whether any unintended genetic changes occurred. To assess this, researchers would need to perform a liver biopsy, which is too risky for a baby of his age.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="6m4i2-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="6m4i2-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="6m4i2-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Still, thanks to the treatment and his dramatic improvement, KJ no longer requires full-time hospitalization and will soon be going home. “We’re so excited that we’ll finally all be together at home,” said Kyle. “So that KJ can be with his siblings — and we can finally breathe again.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="6gmi9-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="6gmi9-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="6gmi9-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The treatment KJ received is specifically tailored for him, designed to address the single mutation in his CPS1 gene. It cannot help other patients with the same enzyme deficiency if their disease is caused by a different mutation in the gene. However, its success offers hope that this method can be adapted for the rapid development of personalized gene therapies for patients with rare diseases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="cc63l-0-0" contenteditable="false"&gt;&lt;div class="ArticleImageComponenta full_wide"&gt;&lt;a class="gelleryOpener" aria-label="open article gallery" data-image-id="ArticleImageData.ryeQesiuzee" id="image_ArticleImageData.ryeQesiuzee"&gt;&lt;p class="galleryCounterExpand"&gt;&lt;span class="numOfImg"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt; View gallery &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="expand" aria-hidden="true"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.ryeQesiuzee" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/05/15/SylajfCmZel/SylajfCmZel_0_0_1280_854_0_x-large.jpg" alt="חייו של התינוק קיי-ג'יי מולדון ניצלו בזכות טיפול באמצעות עריכה גנטית" title="KJ and Kyle Muldoon  (Photo: Children's Hospital of Philadelphia) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="mobileView"&gt;&lt;img id="ReduxEditableImage_ArticleImageData.ryeQesiuzee" src="https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto/picserver6/crop_images/2025/05/15/SylajfCmZel/SylajfCmZel_0_0_1280_854_0_x-large.jpg" alt="חייו של התינוק קיי-ג'יי מולדון ניצלו בזכות טיפול באמצעות עריכה גנטית" title="KJ and Kyle Muldoon  (Photo: Children's Hospital of Philadelphia) " aria-hidden="false"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="ImageDetails"&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCaption"&gt;&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;KJ and Kyle Muldoon &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="ImageCredit"&gt;(&lt;span disabled class="" contenteditable="false"&gt;Photo: Children's Hospital of Philadelphia&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="f9ntd-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="f9ntd-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="f9ntd-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;Estimates suggest there are over 10,000 rare diseases. While each one is individually rare, together they affect about 300 million people worldwide as of 2024. More than 80% of rare diseases are genetic, and the majority affect children. A very large portion of these diseases currently lacks treatment, partly because it has not been financially viable for companies to invest the time and resources required to develop drugs for such small patient populations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="20a50-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="20a50-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="20a50-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The hope of KJ’s medical team — and of other groups working on similar therapies — is that most components of the gene therapy could remain the same, while certain elements, like the small genetic sequence that directs the editor to its target, could be personalized for each patient. This approach could potentially bypass some regulatory steps currently required for treatment approval, further shortening development time and reducing costs.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="d7591-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="d7591-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="d7591-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;How much does it cost to develop such a treatment? It's hard to say. The development budget for KJ’s therapy was part of a larger NIH-funded research project. Musunuru told MIT Technology Review that the development effort involved more than 45 physicians and scientists, along with pro bono assistance from several biotechnology companies. He estimates the eventual cost of gene-editing treatments might be similar to that of liver transplants — around $800,000.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="abl2o-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="abl2o-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="abl2o-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The development of KJ’s treatment was also made possible by the openness of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which is responsible for regulating such therapies. In an editorial published alongside the article by Ahrens-Nicklas, Musunuru and their colleagues, the center’s director, Peter Marks, wrote that he had adopted “an advanced regulatory approach aimed at safely accelerating the development and availability of life-saving drugs.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="a6ipq-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="a6ipq-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="a6ipq-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;However, in March of this year, Marks was forced to resign after attempting to defend the FDA against actions taken by U.S. Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It is now unclear whether the center will continue to support personalized gene therapies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="p43f-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="p43f-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="p43f-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The administration’s cuts to research funding and the NIH budget also raise concerns about the future of gene therapies in particular, and the future of scientific research in the U.S. more broadly. KJ’s treatment would not have been possible without federal investment — both in the treatment itself and in the many years of research that preceded it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="df7ao-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="df7ao-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="df7ao-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;The CRISPR system was discovered through basic research— federally funded — on the immune system of bacteria against viruses. The development of CRISPR into a gene-editing tool was also largely supported by public investment. Federally funded research also led to the sequencing of the human genome and the development of base editing — both essential capabilities for creating KJ’s treatment. Even the search for and development of the therapy were funded by federal government budgets.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="text_editor_paragraph ltr" data-block="true" data-editor="ddo38" data-offset-key="e2lam-0-0"&gt;&lt;p data-offset-key="e2lam-0-0" class="public-DraftStyleDefault-block public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr"&gt;&lt;span data-offset-key="e2lam-0-0"&gt;&lt;span data-text="true"&gt;“This provides a compelling and timely lesson of the value of long-term investments in biomedical research, now under significant attack in the United States,” concluded Francis Collins, former director of the NIH, in an interview with The Washington Post. “The breathtaking campaign to save the life of this baby boy would never have been possible without strong research universities and decades of government support of fundamental and translational research by NIH and FDA.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Ynetnews</author><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 16:17:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTFB6M1E3VkdaYXJaaEczWkZMUmRraDUwMllaSVJwZ1pSME9rc3FlNUNoeVFPX0RiSGFwSUNHS3FpbXlkd2VqVkgwYU9Rc0lZRGdiUDRxMXY0dC1ndUxtYW5vbmJJdWhHbHlhalE</guid></item><item><title>如果您服用Ozempic可能会导致非常不愉快的副作用，医生警告您不要吃流行的食物- LADbible | Doctors warn against eating popular food if you're on Ozempic that could cause very unpleasant side effect - LADbible</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMioAFBVV95cUxOcTNGR3k5SmVDMkJEVlpXWGVvc3kxdFRkaExKN21NU0RCVUxSVHFiWjlQTlRTRGdpSXNuSkRwak9jaElRUUhRR3NVYm81Nm1YclNobkdXRHZ3M2tHcUZSV1VMWGRKUVdWb3l4YmgtSjVWeG1rVUlLaXpjd2ZjaUtOQ3oxT2dQTkh6a016clJQZTd0NnBaUkV6bkZCSjNMYUNV?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Medics have issued a warning about eating a popular food if you're taking Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;In case you've been living under a rock, &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/health"&gt;Ozempic&lt;/a&gt; is a medication that helps to bring down a person's blood sugar levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;It's primarily used for those with type 2 diabetes, but many people, including &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/celebrity"&gt;celebrities&lt;/a&gt;, have been using it - or similar &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/what-happens-when-you-stop-taking-ozempic-499614-20250507"&gt;weight loss jabs&lt;/a&gt; such as Wegovy - to drop the pounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="floating-video-player_container__u4D9_"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;With the use of Ozempic increasing in the last few years, doctors have been warning against some of the side effects reported by those using the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;For example, a number of &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/news/health/ozempic-side-effects-simulation-celebrities-971954-20250503"&gt;celebrities have spoken about their experiences&lt;/a&gt;, with the likes of &lt;a class="anchor_link__6t7IO" href="https://www.ladbible.com/jeremy-clarkson"&gt;Jeremy Clarkson&lt;/a&gt; explaining he suffered from severe nausea, while Amy Schumer reported vomiting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Now, medics have explained that eating certain foods while taking Ozempic can increase the chance of 'Ozempic burps'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are 'Ozempic burps'?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="article-image_articleImage__eyzAn"&gt;&lt;cite class="image-credit_imageCredit__YMlqS"&gt;People have started taking Ozempic for weight loss (Getty Stock Photo)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;Over on WebMD, an article reviewed by one doctor, Shruthi N, MD, explains that Ozempic can have some gastrointestinal side effects, including Ozempic burps, caused by a build-up of sulphur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="text_text__nEn66"&gt;"When your digestion slows down with Ozempic, sulphur can build up in your gut and cause your burps to smell and taste like rotten eggs.

This practice has been linked to better management of blood sugar, especially for those living with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These recommendations gained fresh attention from Dr. Ifabunmi Oduyemi Osonuga at &lt;a href="https://web.oouagoiwoye.edu.ng/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Olabisi Onabanjo University&lt;/a&gt;, Nigeria. His work looked at how increasing water intake might influence glucose parameters and other metabolic factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-understanding-insulin-resistance"&gt;Understanding insulin resistance&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insulin resistance happens when the body does not respond well to &lt;a href="https://diabetes.org/health-wellness/medication/insulin-basics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;insulin&lt;/a&gt;, a hormone responsible for helping cells absorb sugar from the bloodstream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poor response to insulin can lead to elevated blood glucose levels and complications tied to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/about/about-type-2-diabetes.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studies have mentioned that good hydration may help with insulin action by lowering the concentration of certain hormones that affect sugar metabolism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the body has less fluid, it can produce &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526069/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;vasopressin&lt;/a&gt;, which research shows can negatively impact glucose regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-the-impact-of-water-on-blood-glucose"&gt;The impact of water on blood glucose&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some experts note that dehydration could raise the risk of higher blood sugar. One &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5197923/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; found glucose concentrations dropped notably in non-diabetic individuals after a set period of increased water intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Improved hydration supports kidney function so the body can eliminate extra sugar more effectively. This process may aid those dealing with insulin resistance who are looking to optimize glucose levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-tips-for-daily-water-consumption"&gt;Tips for daily water consumption&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suggestions from the &lt;a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/10925/chapter/6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;U.S. Institute of Medicine&lt;/a&gt; say adult men should aim for about 3.7 liters of fluid daily from all sources, while adult women should aim for about 2.7 liters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least half of that total should come from pure water, which means focusing on beverages without added sugars or artificial sweeteners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts often advise drinking water before meals to help reduce unnecessary calories. Those with insulin resistance might benefit from planning their water intake throughout the day to maintain steady hydration levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-happens-when-you-don-t-drink-enough"&gt;What happens when you don’t drink enough&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skipping &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/mars-water-reservoir-discovered-medusae-fossae-formation-two-miles-deep/"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; too often may trigger a hormonal response that works against blood sugar balance. When the body senses dehydration, it produces more vasopressin, a hormone that helps the kidneys retain water but also influences how sugar is processed in the liver and pancreas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher vasopressin levels are linked to increased blood sugar and poorer insulin response. This makes dehydration a quiet contributor to glucose spikes, especially in people who are already managing type 2 diabetes or prediabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-possible-advantages-for-appetite-control"&gt;Possible advantages for appetite control&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have noted that drinking water can help curb hunger by preventing confusion between thirst and hunger signals. Taking a glass of water soon after waking and regularly over the course of the day can help reduce overeating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This practice seems especially relevant for anyone managing insulin resistance, where weight regulation is key. Even small habits like consistent water intake may add up over time when paired with a balanced diet and regular activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-connecting-hydration-with-kidney-health"&gt;Connecting hydration with kidney health&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kidneys play a vital role in clearing excess glucose from the blood. When a person is well hydrated, the kidneys filter more efficiently, helping to excrete extra sugar through urine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without enough &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/unidentified-chemical-found-in-tap-water-across-the-u-s/"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;, this system slows down. That can lead to higher concentrations of glucose in the blood, placing extra strain on the body and increasing the risk of complications in individuals with diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-how-hydration-ties-into-lifestyle-changes"&gt;How hydration ties into lifestyle changes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialists emphasize that hydration alone cannot reverse insulin resistance. They see it as one piece of a bigger plan that includes balanced nutrition, regular exercise, and medical monitoring as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A supportive lifestyle often yields gradual improvements in insulin sensitivity. Good hydration, healthier food choices, and consistent physical movement can work together to keep blood sugar levels more stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-where-more-research-is-heading"&gt;Where more research is heading&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The evidence that short-duration exposure to plain &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/water-molecule-discovery-will-force-textbooks-to-be-rewritten/"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; intake can improve glycemic parameters in diabetic patients is limited,” remarked Dr. Osonuga. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigators have observed that short-term trials linking plain water intake to better glycemic measures show promise, especially in individuals who do not yet have diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longer and broader studies are planned to explore whether these improvements translate to lasting changes in people already diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers hope this approach might guide personalized water-consumption advice for different groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-practical-reminders"&gt;Practical reminders&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinicians suggest checking the color of one’s urine as a quick gauge of hydration, aiming for a light yellow shade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Individuals should consider other health factors, such as kidney conditions or cardiovascular issues, before making drastic changes to fluid intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who struggle with daily water consumption might try flavor-infused water using slices of fruit for variety without adding sugary ingredients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others may prefer consistent sipping throughout the day to stay hydrated without feeling overloaded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-final-thoughts-on-hydration-habits"&gt;Final thoughts on hydration habits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;People diagnosed with diabetes need strategies to keep their blood sugar in a healthier range. Drinking eight to 10 glasses of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/new-discovery-water-molecules-will-force-chemistry-textbooks-to-be-rewritten/"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; daily could be a helpful step, but it is only one part of the puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focusing on the whole lifestyle picture offers the best results. With careful planning, consistent monitoring, and professional advice, water intake may play a meaningful role in supporting balanced glucose levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468227624000590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scientific African&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 16:04:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMivwFBVV95cUxQc1pfRHhURXB2YTFJMlI5OUpPV2k2SHZxUUFzcm81bjlWN0hqRHhyTTI2UnRIRHdJcHRjbjF1TlBhNFNtY1ZUT0FIRlh2U3I0djVSNzZ3QXc4c3FiUDZOUGNRZTVhd2RDS1JsMTJEdkJfTHVQV3hRNzc4VTA3c2dHblRMc1dDRGJPUnI4QkxycUdhWkRjeWhITEk2RjkzOWlXVWw5SVpRQVdJVE5QTDE4RUFYTnRoMXdMakdZZjVOTQ</guid></item><item><title>另一位健美运动员刚刚死于可怕的死亡- futurism.com | Another Bodybuilder Just Died a Horrible Death - futurism.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieEFVX3lxTE40cVBId1pmNkhQOGVxY09weW9PcmE5Wmp5M3hTMGZLSVdvSWRNWWRUWUtuV2tIaWhfbUdseVR5ekd4bElkdmJfd093OVp3M2pvbTNFeUtmaGw4VkczUlRoZ2J4MlNLdXh6VWtMSXVYVEx3S0ZDZlVUeg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section id="incArticle" class="post-content z-50 w-full p-3 space-y-4 bg-white border lg:-mt-6 md:p-4 md:border-gray-900 lg:ml-3 lg:w-2/3 font-b text-3"&gt;&lt;div class="space-y-4 lg:space-y-0"&gt;&lt;p class="block text-xs text-gray-500 uppercase lg:hidden font-c"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Image by @tkachyk_1990 via Instagram / Futurism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After quitting the bizarre injections that puffed up his muscles, a Russian bodybuilder has become the latest in a long and unfortunate line of pro weightlifters to meet untimely demises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/35073298/bodybuilding-star-nikita-tkachuk-dead-muscle-growth-injections/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, 35-year-old Nikita Tkachuk hadn't injected synthol — a so-called "&lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-synthol-and-why-are-bodybuilders-injecting-it-into-their-muscles-237528" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;site enhancement oil&lt;/a&gt;" primarily made up of oils like paraffin or sesame alongside a local anesthetic and benzoyl alcohol that makes muscles appear bulkier without actually causing any strength or fitness benefits — before he died of a heart attack in a St. Petersburg hospital last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story of how he got there is tragic, even for the &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/fitness-influencer-death" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;morbid world of weightlifting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After winning "Master of Sports" in Russia at 21, Tkachuk began injecting synthol to appear beefier. That practice is known as "&lt;a href="https://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/575932/2/Synthol_Hall_Grogan_Gough.pdf" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;fluffing&lt;/a&gt;," and it produces muscles that appear, as &lt;em&gt;Iron Man&lt;/em&gt; magazine put it back in 2013, "&lt;a href="https://www.ironmanmagazine.com/inject-to-grow/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;comically inflated&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Tkachuk signed a deal with a pharmaceutical company that contractually obligated him to keep taking the shots — a deal that turned out to be deadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After initially being diagnosed with sarcoidosis, a disorder involving tiny granules of immune cells forming on his organs, the strain from all that "fluffing" ultimately led to kidney and lung failure, and then a heart attack, his widow, Maria Tkachuk, said, per &lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There were many trials over the years," said the widow Tkachuk, who is also a bodybuilder. "[His] resources ran out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though a lot remains unclear about the man's death, including why he finally succumbed years after quitting the injections, his regret over the use of synthol — which in a 2022 video he called his "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10xuvEOBWSc" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;biggest mistake&lt;/a&gt;" — is plain as day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If your arm is 18 inches or 20 inches, what will it change in your life?" Tkachuk said ahead of his death, per &lt;em&gt;The Sun&lt;/em&gt;. "You're going to lose a lot of health. It's not worth it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I could back to 2015-2016, I would not do it," he continued. "I basically ruined my whole sporting career."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though he's joined in death by a &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/another-young-bodybuilder-died" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;long line of young bodybuilders&lt;/a&gt; who died too soon after taking various substances to either lose weight or get swole, Tkachuk's story is especially tragic because he spoke out against the injections that ultimately killed him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, his wife is left to pick up the pieces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are no other words for now," his widow said.

The oils are extracted from the seeds of plants, like canola oil from canola — or rapeseed — plant seeds. The other seed oils of concern are corn, cottonseed, grapeseed, sunflower, safflower and rice bran oils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Seed oils are primarily polyunsaturated fats, which are less chemically stable than saturated fats, the main lipid in animal fats.

That hydrofluorosilicic acid also contains more arsenic than sodium fluoride is also true, &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2013-19486/p-32" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:according to the EPA;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;according to the EPA&lt;/a&gt;, which has also said it limits the amount of arsenic allowed in water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“Toxic Nation” sources added that fluoride can block thyroid receptors and cause dental fluorosis. This is a cosmetic change in children’s tooth enamel caused by ingesting excessive fluoride while their permanent teeth are still forming underneath their gums, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oral-health/about/about-dental-fluorosis.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The background: &lt;/strong&gt;Medical organizations or institutions such as the &lt;a href="https://www.ada.org/resources/community-initiatives/fluoride-in-water/fluoridation-faqs" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Dental Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American Dental Association&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/faq/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:the CDC;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;the CDC&lt;/a&gt; continue to support water fluoridation and use of fluoride toothpaste. Most of the documentary sources acknowledged that sodium fluoride can strengthen enamel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The research: &lt;/strong&gt;Studies prove that “water fluoridation continues to be effective in reducing dental decay by at least 25% in children and adults, even in the of era widespread availability of fluoride from other sources, such as fluoride toothpaste,” according to the &lt;a href="https://www.ada.org/resources/community-initiatives/fluoride-in-water/fluoridation-faqs" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Dental Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American Dental Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;A new study &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/30/health/fluoride-removal-excess-cavities-study?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:published in;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;published in&lt;/a&gt; the journal JAMA affirms this.

And research on adults is scarce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you can do&lt;/strong&gt;: If you want to avoid fluoride intake, you can buy water filters that filter out fluoride. They should be independently certified, such as by the National Sanitation Foundation or another official lab. Also ensure your kids don’t swallow toothpaste that contains fluoride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;To help prevent cavities, brush and floss your teeth daily and nightly, and limit your intake of sugary foods and beverages, the &lt;a href="https://www.mouthhealthy.org/dental-care/how-do-we-prevent-cavities" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Dental Association;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;American Dental Association&lt;/a&gt; recommends.

            Ultraprocessed foods, seed oils, pesticides and fluoride: They’re all targets of the “Make America Healthy Again” movement, whose chief proponent is US Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/27/health/covid-vaccine-pregnant-women-children-recommendation"&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&lt;/a&gt;

            Now, MAHA Films, a production company dedicated to promoting &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/12/politics/rfk-trump-health-influencers"&gt;the movement’s values&lt;/a&gt;, has released its first documentary.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Toxic Nation: From Fluoride to Seed Oils — How We Got Here, Who Profits, and What You Can Do” highlights those four food- and environmental-related issues that Kennedy’s nonprofit MAHA Action, an advocacy partner for the film, says “silently endanger millions of Americans every day.” &lt;a href="https://rka9exdbb.cc.rs6.net/tn.jsp?f=001tZooA0RZeZZd3ESBpK13tT9Et8brE4sosAMhAVJaoASRw6Iu4gu-4XfiwelvYFk8TaHGOVcGJ_qY5F2orDzNws11WxZKryJK_BPzTnds1jaqLj1xoUDTlNuDzyPPuM_9Q4rdQ4rAkZAhtebEUn3UcA==&amp;amp;c=PEXIr4Ve566P7F1V4Zm8K1slXbvRa6aL9rC-9oJbJ8T7fWoMVNFpWg==&amp;amp;ch=fCWt771tjNapjpiFfA66ZZ50-Ju5XUsJxO8uSLFjsbH1ddwuiX0LXg==" target="_blank"&gt;Released online Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, the film is the first in a planned four-part series.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “If we can love our children more than we hate each other, we can solve the chronic disease epidemic affecting them,” producer and director Jeff Hays said in a news release, &lt;a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/e22JSr2g7mo?si=lPY3kHcJr8zdXPnC" target="_blank"&gt;quoting Kennedy’s ethos&lt;/a&gt;. “‘Toxic Nation’ is our love letter to that vision, a call to create an America where families can finally thrive in true health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The documentary’s release follows the May 22 publication of the first MAHA Commission report, which &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/22/politics/maha-rfk-report-medicines-processed-foods-pesticides"&gt;lays the groundwork&lt;/a&gt; for an overhaul of federal policy to reduce the burden of chronic disease on American children. Still, Kennedy’s agenda to overhaul food systems, pharmaceuticals and environmental toxins may run into roadblocks due to significant budget and staffing &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/27/health/hhs-rfk-job-cuts"&gt;cuts at HHS&lt;/a&gt; and the US Environmental Protection Agency.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The Trump Administration can’t have it both ways,” Scott Faber, senior vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit environmental health organization, wrote in an email. (Although there is substantial overlap with some issues that have become Kennedy’s focus at HHS, the documentary was not released by the federal government.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “On the one hand, they’re sounding the alarm about diet-related disease and the illnesses caused by dangerous chemicals,” Faber added. “On the other hand, they’re making it &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/01/health/staff-cuts-at-federal-health-agencies-have-begun"&gt;harder for people&lt;/a&gt; to build healthy diets and eliminating the safeguards that protect us from &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/14/health/forever-chemicals-epa-regulation"&gt;toxins like PFAS&lt;/a&gt; and pathogens.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Although some experts have long talked about the effects of what we consume on our risk of disease, when it comes to specifics, there is some controversy around the potential dangers, benefits or neutrality, if any.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;The claim:&lt;/strong&gt; The documentary calls out ultraprocessed foods as one of the roots of chronic disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb75egd000h3b6mr9vh5j8w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;The background:&lt;/strong&gt; Composing &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/26/health/ultraprocessed-hyperpalatable-foods-wellness"&gt;up to 70%&lt;/a&gt; of the US food supply, ultraprocessed foods are made with industrial techniques and ingredients “never or rarely used in kitchens, or classes of additives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,” according to the &lt;a href="https://www.fao.org/3/ca5644en/ca5644en.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Ultraprocessed foods are typically low in fiber; are high in calories, added sugar, refined grains and fats, and sodium; and include additives such as preservatives, flavor enhancers &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/17/health/red-40-food-dyes-wellness"&gt;or dyes&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;The research:&lt;/strong&gt; Numerous studies over decades have linked consumption of ultraprocessed foods to diseases or health issues &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/08/health/ultraprocessed-food-additives-harm-wellness"&gt;including type 2 diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/28/health/ultraprocessed-food-health-risks-study-wellness"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;, obesity, premature death, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/31/health/ultraprocessed-foods-cancer-wellness"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, depression, cognitive decline, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/22/health/ultraprocessed-food-stroke-cognitive-decline-wellness"&gt;stroke&lt;/a&gt; and sleep disorders.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The harms could be partly due to ultraprocessed foods’ effects on metabolism, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/05/health/high-cholesterol-triglycerides-alzheimers-dementia-risk-wellness"&gt;experts have said&lt;/a&gt; — since without fiber, for example, refined carbohydrates can raise triglycerides and spike blood glucose levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb75egd000l3b6ml7fh92bc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;QUIZ: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2023/11/health/ultraprocessed-foods-health-wellness/"&gt;How much ultraprocessed food are you eating?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;What you can do&lt;/strong&gt;: Limit your intake of ultraprocessed foods by increasing your consumption of whole fruits, veggies, grains, nuts and seeds, and legumes. Read ingredient labels and be aware of how much sodium you’re eating and how certain foods make you feel; ultraprocessed foods can keep you wanting more, whereas whole foods are more satiating.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;The claim:&lt;/strong&gt; The documentary challenges the long-held guidance that for heart health, cooks should replace saturated fats from animal products such as beef tallow, pig lard and butter with seed oils. (Kennedy applauded &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/25/health/beef-tallow-healthy-seed-oils-rfk-wellness"&gt;Steak ‘n Shake’s switchover&lt;/a&gt; from seed oils to beef tallow for frying its french fries, calling it a healthier choice.)
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb75egd000p3b6m2h3bd3p3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;The background:&lt;/strong&gt; Vegetable and seed oils became popular in the mid-20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, when scientists began looking into animal fat as&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the culprit behind the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/04/health/cardiovascular-disease-report-2050/index.html"&gt;uptick in cardiovascular issues&lt;/a&gt; and promoted oils as heart-healthy alternatives.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb75egd000q3b6mk7woy822@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some experts’ concerns about seed oils are based on their chemistry, the industrial production involving various chemicals and the behavior of seed oils when they’re exposed to heat, air and light. The oils are extracted from the seeds of plants, like canola oil from canola — or rapeseed — plant seeds. The other seed oils of concern are corn, cottonseed, grapeseed, sunflower, safflower and rice bran oils.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb75egd000r3b6mw18qcbkr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Seed oils are primarily polyunsaturated fats, which are less chemically stable than saturated fats, the main lipid in animal fats. Polyunsaturated fats are thus prone &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4066722/" target="_blank"&gt;to faster peroxidation&lt;/a&gt; when exposed to oxygen or cooked, which can produce molecules linked to cellular damage and oxidative stress, Dr. Daisy Zamora, an associate professor at the University of North Carolina’s School of Medicine, told CNN in March.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmbb75egd000s3b6mh85ai9w5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;The research:&lt;/strong&gt; Over the past few decades and continuing today, scientists have published copious data showing that diets &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/06/health/butter-seed-oils-reduced-death-wellness/index.html"&gt;higher in plant fats&lt;/a&gt; result in &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/09/health/fat-stroke-risk-wellness/index.html"&gt;better health outcomes&lt;/a&gt; than diets higher in animal fats, Dr. Alice H.

            The research on seed oils has picked up over the past decade , including Zamora’s &lt;a href="https://journals.lww.com/pain/abstract/2013/11000/targeted_alteration_of_dietary_n_3_and_n_6_fatty.27.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; that found limiting seed oils improved &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/374/bmj.n1448" target="_blank"&gt;participants’ chronic pain&lt;/a&gt;. Other studies have linked seed oil intake with atherosclerosis or &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5422895/#Sec18" target="_blank"&gt;biomarkers of fat&lt;/a&gt; buildup in arteries. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

            The risk of harmful degradation products may not come into play unless the oils are cooked too hot, used repeatedly or kept for too long, and it’s possible that some food companies, restaurants and individuals may be doing those things, Dr. Eric Decker, a professor of food science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, told CNN in a previous story.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;What you can do&lt;/strong&gt;: If you’re concerned about seed oils, you can try substituting &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/19/health/olive-oil-healthiest-quality-wellness"&gt;extra virgin olive oil&lt;/a&gt; or avocado oil, experts said. Experts also recommend that any fat you consume should be in moderation.

            &lt;strong&gt;The claim:&lt;/strong&gt; The film raises concerns about the herbicide glyphosate, citing previously documented links to cancer. Sources also said glyphosate may &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/29/health/endocrine-disrupting-chemicals-wellness"&gt;cause endocrine disruption&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/23/health/microbiome-health-wellness"&gt;damaged gut microbiomes&lt;/a&gt;, with the latter potentially increasing risk for irritable bowel diseases and celiac disease.

            &lt;strong&gt;The research:&lt;/strong&gt; Research on the effects of glyphosate on the human gut microbiome is in the early stages, although harm in rats has been found. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/02/14/health/us-glyphosate-cancer-study-scli-intl"&gt;A 2019 analysis&lt;/a&gt; of studies on thousands of people and animals found that exposure to glyphosate was associated with a 41% higher risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer of the immune system.

            The US Food and Drug Administration’s role is to ensure that pesticide or herbicide residues on or in domestic and imported foods don’t exceed limits set by the EPA, at levels the EPA determines to “provide a reasonable certainty of no harm,” &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/pesticides/questions-and-answers-glyphosate" target="_blank"&gt;according to the FDA&lt;/a&gt;.

            The &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/pesticides/epa-releases-draft-risk-assessments-glyphosate" target="_blank"&gt;EPA has said&lt;/a&gt; that glyphosate isn’t likely to be carcinogenic for humans and that it &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/01/health/epa-says-glyphosate-is-safe"&gt;continues to find&lt;/a&gt; “no risks to public health when glyphosate is used in accordance with its current label.”

            The EPA’s conclusion contradicts the &lt;a href="https://www.iarc.who.int/featured-news/media-centre-iarc-news-glyphosate/" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization’s stance&lt;/a&gt;, although the latter &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/who-iarc-glyphosate/" target="_blank"&gt;has been controversial&lt;/a&gt;   among both industry and some health experts. The decision was followed by &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/01/29/us/roundup-cancer-verdict-philadelphia-bayer-monsanto"&gt;thousands of lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; — against the leading producer of glyphosate-based weed killers — claiming that glyphosate exposure caused plaintiffs’ cancer. Some have been successful to varying degrees, including a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/10/health/monsanto-johnson-trial-verdict"&gt;high-profile case&lt;/a&gt; partly argued by Kennedy when he was an environmental lawyer.

            &lt;strong&gt;What you can do:&lt;/strong&gt; You can limit your consumption of herbicides (as well as pesticides) by eating mostly or only organic foods. Since that’s not feasible for many people, you can still make an impact by reducing your intake of the foods on the Environmental Working Group’s &lt;a href="https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/dirty-dozen.php" target="_blank"&gt;“Dirty Dozen” list&lt;/a&gt; and increasing your intake of &lt;a href="https://www.ewg.org/2024foodnews/clean-fifteen.php" target="_blank"&gt;its “Clean Fifteen”&lt;/a&gt; foods. The lists refer to conventionally grown fruits and vegetables with the most or least amount of pesticide residues, respectively.

            Still, the &lt;a href="https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/faq.php" target="_blank"&gt;EWG also says&lt;/a&gt; the health benefits of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables outweigh the risks of pesticide exposure, so don’t let perfection be the enemy of the good.

            &lt;strong&gt;The claim: &lt;/strong&gt;Documentary sources claimed that the type of fluoride predominantly used in drinking water for most of the US population differs from dental sodium fluoride. That’s a problem, they say, because it’s hydrofluorosilicic acid, &lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/halogen" target="_blank"&gt;a chemical byproduct&lt;/a&gt; of the phosphate fertilizer industry, and contains heavy metals &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/15/health/arsenic-cadmium-rice-wellness"&gt;such as arsenic&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            It’s true that hydrofluorosilicic acid is the fluoridation &lt;a href="https://www.nih.gov/sites/default/files/institutes/foia/58947-tranche-6.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;agent of choice&lt;/a&gt; for many municipalities . That hydrofluorosilicic acid also contains more arsenic than sodium fluoride is also true, &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2013-19486/p-32" target="_blank"&gt;according to the EPA&lt;/a&gt;, which has also said it limits the amount of arsenic allowed in water.

            “Toxic Nation” sources&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;added that fluoride can block thyroid receptors and cause dental fluorosis. This is a cosmetic change in children’s tooth enamel caused by ingesting excessive fluoride while their permanent teeth are still forming underneath their gums, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/oral-health/about/about-dental-fluorosis.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

Most of the documentary sources acknowledged that sodium fluoride can strengthen enamel.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;The research: &lt;/strong&gt;Studies prove that “water fluoridation continues to be effective in reducing dental decay by at least 25% in children and adults, even in the of era widespread availability of fluoride from other sources, such as fluoride toothpaste,” according to the &lt;a href="https://www.ada.org/resources/community-initiatives/fluoride-in-water/fluoridation-faqs" target="_blank"&gt;American Dental Association&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

It estimated that eliminating fluoride from public water systems would be associated with a 7.5% increase in tooth decay, according to data on 8,484 children with an average age of 9.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            But &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/11/03/health/rfk-jr-fluoride-science"&gt;a few studies&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/publications/monographs/mgraph08" target="_blank"&gt;a federal review&lt;/a&gt; published in August, have supported concerns about higher levels of fluoride in water affecting children’s intellectual development. Some have also found only slight dental benefits of fluoridating water. But the federal review noted that associations between normal levels of fluoride and children’s IQ are less consistent. And research on adults is scarce.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;strong&gt;What you can do&lt;/strong&gt;: If you want to avoid fluoride intake, you can buy water filters that filter out fluoride. They should be independently certified, such as by the National Sanitation Foundation or another official lab. Also ensure your kids don’t swallow toothpaste that contains fluoride.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

            To help prevent cavities, brush and floss your teeth daily and nightly, and limit your intake of sugary foods and beverages, the &lt;a href="https://www.mouthhealthy.org/dental-care/how-do-we-prevent-cavities" target="_blank"&gt;American Dental Association&lt;/a&gt; recommends. If you do eat them, do so at mealtimes. You should also visit your dentist regularly.

    &lt;p&gt;Last week, the World Health Organization designated NB.1.8.1, a new strain of COVID-19 that’s been rising in frequency lately, as a “variant under monitoring.” Now, Washington state has its first case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case was detected by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance program at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, according to a statement sent to McClatchy by the Washington State Department of Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There appears to be a single detection of NB.1.8.1 in Washington state,” the statement said. “The sample was collected on May 15th 2025 by Ginko Bioworks, the industry partner for CDC’s Traveler Genomic Surveillance Program. This means this sample was captured via a CDC program, not a WA surveillance system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington is one of four states where airport screening has detected the new variant, along with California, New York and Virginia. Reports suggest that only a handful of states have detected the variant, which has yet to become common enough for the CDC to include it on its COVID-19 variant tracking dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The variant has been linked to a recent spike in COVID-19 cases in China, leading to concerns it could spread quickly in the U.S. However, officials say the early indications are that the variant doesn’t pose much of a threat. Here’s what to know about NB.1.8.1 in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is NB.1.8.1?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to WHO, the frequency of NB.1.8.1 cases quadrupled during April. The variant accounted for 2.5% of COVID-19 samples obtained over the week ending April 6. By April 27, that number had risen to 10.7%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite the sharp rise, health officials say that the case doesn’t necessarily pose a threat to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to WHO, there isn’t much evidence that NB.1.8.1 is any more dangerous than existing variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The additional public health risk posed by NB.1.8.1 is evaluated as low,” WHO’s latest report on the strain says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s largely due to the fact that early evidence indicates available COVID vaccines protect against the severe illness in patients with the new variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;NB.1.8.1 risk in WA&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO did note that some countries have seen an increase in cases and hospitalizations as NB.1.8.1 spread. However, WHO’s latest update on the variant states that “current data do not indicate that this variant leads to more severe illness than other variants in circulation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO also noted that little information is available about the variant right now, and that these conclusions are drawn from preliminary observations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state health department echoed WHO, saying that there’s no evidence the variant poses significant risk to the public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOH noted that the case was detected in the airport, making it unclear whether or not the person who tested positive is a Washington resident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Because this is a Traveler Genomic Surveillance collection, the collection site would be SEA-TAC airport; however, that doesn’t mean that the case is necessarily a Washington resident, meaning county may not be a relevant field,” the DOH statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;COVID-19 cases in WA&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 case counts have fallen in Washington so far this year. Through mid-May, the state has seen 399 COVID-19 deaths, according to DOH’s respiratory illness dashboard. That’s less than half of the 897 deaths seen at this point last year, and around 25% of the number seen in 2023. The disease currently accounts for 0.5% of Washington hospital visits, compared to 0.9% last May and 1.5% in May of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p id="userMessagingIn-story"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In mouse models with a rare mutation that causes dopamine to leak abnormally, KOR blockers reduced this leakage and restored normal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach could offer safer treatment alternatives for conditions like ADHD, bipolar disorder, and autism, which are often linked to disrupted dopamine signaling. Importantly, the treatment did not affect animals without the mutation, suggesting targeted therapeutic potential with fewer side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeted Action:&lt;/strong&gt; Blocking KOR reduces dopamine transporter leakage in mice with the DAT Val559 mutation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Restoration:&lt;/strong&gt; KOR blockers reversed cognitive and compulsive symptoms without affecting healthy animals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings offer a potential new pathway for treating multiple dopamine-related brain disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;FAU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dopamine, a small molecule derived from the amino acid tyrosine, plays a significant role in regulating multiple essential brain functions including movement, mood and motivation as well as multiple cognitive functions including attention and memory. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dopamine signaling in the brain is a complex process, with many mechanisms in place to accelerate or slow down dopamine’s effects. When dopamine is released from nerve cells, its efficient removal to limit signaling occurs through the activity of special proteins called “transporters,” ensuring a shorter action of dopamine in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110552"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/dopamine-opioid-receptor-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The researchers believe that further work on KOR blockers may give individuals affected with brain disorders that display these alterations better treatment options than what is currently available today. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disruptions in dopamine signaling have been linked to several neuropsychiatric disorders, including ADHD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, substance use disorder and addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current treatments for dopamine-related conditions use agents that can either block or enhance dopamine signaling such as stimulants used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder including amphetamines, which can have unwanted side effects or lead to addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The power of dopamine to regulate brain mechanisms of thought, mood and reward has kept scientists searching for better ways to control its actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a newly published study in the journal &lt;em&gt;Molecular Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;, researchers from Florida Atlantic University and their collaborators have discovered a potentially safer yet effective treatment for multiple disorders that display altered dopamine signaling. The “key?” A molecule that targets a specific protein called the kappa opioid receptor (KOR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opioids are commonly known as powerful painkillers with strong psychoactive effects. They increase dopamine signaling in the brain, producing pleasurable sensations that can encourage repeated use and, over time, lead to addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both endogenous and illicit opioid molecules act on signaling proteins termed receptors. But all opioid receptors are not the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current study, the researchers targeted KOR, a subtype of opioid receptor that when activated can decrease synaptic dopamine levels by decreasing dopamine release and increasing the availability of synaptic dopamine transporters, thereby halting the dopamine signal. Instead of activating KOR, scientists used a drug that can block it. But wouldn’t this cause addiction by elevating dopamine?   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It all depends on whether dopamine levels are elevated or suppressed by the insult that produces the disorder to begin with,” said Randy D. Blakely, Ph.D., senior author,  executive director of the FAU Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute, the David J.S. Nicholson Distinguished Professor in Neuroscience, and a professor of biomedical science in FAU’s Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For some people, a rare genetic mutation known as DAT Val559 causes the dopamine transporter to ‘run backward,’ leaking dopamine into the synapse rather than sucking it away, turning the transporter from an efficient nano-vacuum cleaner into a nano-leaky faucet.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But shouldn’t a leaking dopamine into the synapses elevate dopamine in the synapse and lead to addiction?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Blakely, unlike the sharp rise in dopamine that triggers euphoria and can lead to addiction, dopamine that dribbles out through a leaky transporter makes it hard for a receptive brain cell to detect the normal rapid rise in dopamine that acts to fine tune our thinking and emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The DAT Val559 genetic variant has been found in individuals with diagnoses of ADHD, ASD and BPD,” said Blakely. “This led us to ponder whether blocking KORs could reduce the expression of leaky dopamine transporters and thereby actually normalize dopamine signaling and restore normal cognition and behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results of the study reveal that this is indeed the case. More than a decade ago, Blakely’s team and collaborators demonstrated that mice engineered to express the mutation show altered behaviors that can be aligned with features seen in individuals with cognitive and compulsive disorders and altered psychostimulant responses, interestingly, in a sex-dependent manner.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers administered a long-acting KOR blocking drug to these mice, they found that the agent reduced the expression of the mutant transporter on the cell surface where it normally encounters dopamine, preventing dopamine leaks from reaching dopamine receptors and correcting multiple behavioral deficits seen in the mutant mice.&lt;strong&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our studies indicate that when there’s an issue with how DAT is expressed, activated or inhibited, the brain can have altered states of dopamine availability, creating the traits that psychiatrists describe as inattention or compulsivity as well as altered patterns of reactivity and emotion,” said Felix P. Mayer, Ph.D., first author and a former post-doctoral researcher in the Blakely lab, who is now a faculty member at the University of Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayer says that by blocking KOR, they have found a way to help fix this issue, at least in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Since the DAT mutation is rare, our findings might be considered of limited medical significance,” said Blakely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“However, we and others have found that DAT proteins are sensitively regulated by multiple pathways inside cells. Changes in any one of these pathways, as well as changes that regulate how dopamine is released and acts, could cause behavioral disorders that would benefit from KOR blockers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blakely notes however that antagonizing KOR could have opposite effects if dysregulation of dopamine signaling is not the issue underlying the diagnosis. The key will be defining the type of dopamine change that contributes to the disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, for the behaviors assessed in the study, animals with normal DAT protein failed to show behavioral changes when exposed to the KOR antagonist at the doses given, suggesting a degree of protection against side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers believe that further work on KOR blockers may give individuals affected with brain disorders that display these alterations better treatment options than what is currently available today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And although the DAT Val559 mutation produces sex-dependent behavioral changes, blocking KOR improved the distinct alterations seen in males and females, suggesting that utility of KOR blockers, at least in mice, is not limited by sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The discovery of genetic variation in proteins that tightly regulate brain dopamine signaling, like DAT Val559, no matter how rare, can still offer insights into more common disease mechanisms,” said Sammanda Ramamoorthy, Ph.D., co-corresponding author on the study and a professor of pharmacology and toxicology at Virginia Commonwealth University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study co-authors are Adele Stewart, Ph.D., FAU Schmidt College of Medicine and Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute; Durairaj Ragu Varman, Ph.D., and Lankupalle D.

DAT Val559, like several other disease-associated variants of DAT, exhibits anomalous DA efflux (ADE) that can be blocked by d-amphetamine and methylphenidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kappa opioid receptors (KORs) are expressed by DA neurons and modulate DA release and clearance, suggesting that targeting KORs might also provide an alternative approach to normalizing DA-signaling disrupted by perturbed DAT function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we demonstrate that KOR stimulation leads to enhanced surface trafficking and phosphorylation of Thr53 in wildtype DAT, effects achieved constitutively by the Val559 mutant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, these effects can be rescued by KOR antagonism of DAT Val559 in ex vivo preparations. Importantly, KOR antagonism also corrected in vivo DA release as well as sex-dependent behavioral abnormalities observed in DAT Val559 mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given their low abuse liability, our studies with a construct valid model of human DA associated disorders reinforce considerations of KOR antagonism as a pharmacological strategy to treat DA associated brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 15:31:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMibkFVX3lxTE4zWXBoRjFoZFZ1TkNGRjlLOEpsdDJkdTM2XzktRkNTbTQ4dFJQVGlLQWRSbWtzNXk2ZTl3UEJCTVlFYV8zSmhkeGVBMDZYZzlxam50RnZnUmtzNTNtc3RTc2NwbFhfREc2aFllN0JR</guid></item><item><title>大幅削减削弱了美国公共卫生系统的基础，结束了进步，威胁到更糟糕的未来-美联社新闻 | Deep cuts erode the foundations of US public health system, end progress, threaten worse to come - AP News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMinAFBVV95cUxPZldOSDFzREJjSUtZbnpKbHlQSTRPS3J0cERYbVRqODdUNWV1VWNQa2RLS3l2WkFQNDMteHRxMk9PdUtpVUtMc1hfVUk2SFAtdDY2cERaVzkwLWZfb0F5WW9BS2k2bUJJQWwtODlPT3hMcE9FUzhNcUFBTU5EVnhDZ0QzWlRINFRCRHhkR2c5bDI3REliRXdCdHgtdmY?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="main-content"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;p class="h2"&gt;&lt;span id="challenge-error-text"&gt;Enable JavaScript and cookies to continue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AP News</author><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 15:03:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMinAFBVV95cUxPZldOSDFzREJjSUtZbnpKbHlQSTRPS3J0cERYbVRqODdUNWV1VWNQa2RLS3l2WkFQNDMteHRxMk9PdUtpVUtMc1hfVUk2SFAtdDY2cERaVzkwLWZfb0F5WW9BS2k2bUJJQWwtODlPT3hMcE9FUzhNcUFBTU5EVnhDZ0QzWlRINFRCRHhkR2c5bDI3REliRXdCdHgtdmY</guid></item><item><title>7种可能破坏你身体的酸奶-吃这个不是那个 | 7 Yogurts That May Wreck Your Body - Eat This Not That</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYkFVX3lxTE84WGNCU2hRdjFleEZUTGxNODRyamk0M1VMMjlxeXltQkd3TGJMRExsSHItdzhfSHQyZHhmRUVHcXJpWmx6T2J6SDlqaWlFdGxFRmRnMG9jUUFkWTQ1bEJFcEpR?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content single-post-content"&gt;
										
					
					
					&lt;p&gt;Yogurt is one of the best things you can enjoy for your health—rich in protein (especially for Greek yogurt), calcium, and probiotics, yogurt is a delicious and versatile ingredient to enjoy at any time of the day. Not all yogurts are created equal, though. For every limited-ingredient, high-quality option at the store there are several more packed with unnecessary sugars and additives, turning what should be a simple, nutrient-dense food into an ultraprocessed disaster. Here are seven yogurts that could negatively impact your health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoplait &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.yoplait.com/products/light-single-serve-strawberry" target="_blank"&gt;Light Strawberry&lt;/a&gt; contains a laundry list of additives—including food colorings like Red #40—artificial sweeteners, and more. One 6 oz container has 9 g of sugar and 80 calories, which is a positive element for those counting calories. Overall there isn’t really any way this yogurt could be considered a healthy option when it’s highly processed and contains dubious ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="karma_unit karma_unit--distinct inline karma_unit--mobile hide-desktop karma_unit--sliding htlad-lazy-mob-square-fixed karma_unit--halfpage"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YoCrunch LowFat &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://www.yocrunch.com/yogurt-with-toppings/m-and-m-yogurt/" target="_blank"&gt;Vanilla with M&amp;amp;M’s&lt;/a&gt; is marketed towards children, and it certainly looks bright and fun until you look at the label: One 6 oz container has 26 g of sugar—more than is recommended for an adult woman—which includes 20 g of added sugar. This dessert (because that’s exactly what it is) also contains a long list of additives and food colorings. Not even close to a healthy treat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;La Yogurt’s Probiotic &lt;a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://layogurt.com/yogurts/rich-creamy-lowfat/" target="_blank"&gt;Pumpkin Pie Yogurt&lt;/a&gt; is, according to the company, “kid approved”, but with 29 g of sugar per 170 g container I would be wary about that.

The chemical messenger FLP-11 activates a receptor called DMSR-1 in different neurons to either silence wakefulness or shut down sleep, acting as a biological on-off switch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dual function helps regulate not just sleep initiation but also its duration. The discovery could inform future research on sleep disorders like insomnia and narcolepsy in humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single Molecule, Dual Role:&lt;/strong&gt; FLP-11 both induces and ends sleep in &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; by acting on different neurons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Receptor Discovery:&lt;/strong&gt; The receptor DMSR-1 is essential for interpreting FLP-11’s sleep commands.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Relevance:&lt;/strong&gt; Though studied in worms, this mechanism may reveal conserved sleep pathways across species, including humans.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;TUD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People spend about a third of their life asleep. Yet, surprisingly little is known about how our brains control falling asleep and waking up. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, researchers led by Prof. Henrik Bringmann at the Biotechnology Center (BIOTEC) of TUD Dresden University of Technology discovered another piece of this puzzle. The team showed that a single brain signal acts like a biological switch – both triggering sleep and ending it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110544"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-molecule-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-molecule-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-molecule-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-molecule-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-molecule-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-molecule-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-molecule-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-molecule-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-molecule-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-molecule-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-molecule-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-molecule-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-molecule-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-molecule-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/sleep-molecule-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This research sheds light on one of the fundamental questions in biology: how organisms regulate sleep and wakefulness. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their findings, published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;, were made possible by studying a tiny roundworm C. elegans, a powerful model organism in biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is really important to be able to fall asleep, but just as important to wake up too!,” says Prof. Bringmann, research group leader at BIOTEC who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that falling asleep and waking up is controlled by a special set of brain cells, called sleep neurons. However, we don’t know how exactly they control the downstream molecular pathways to make us fall asleep and wake up again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bringmann group turned to &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt;, a tiny roundworm to answer these questions. In contrast to humans, who have thousands of sleep neurons that control sleep, &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; needs just one neuron to do this job. This simplicity makes it a perfect model organism to study the principal molecular pathways controlling sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research sheds light on one of the fundamental questions in biology: how organisms regulate sleep and wakefulness. By understanding the fundamental molecular machinery behind sleep, researchers can better understand sleep disorders such as narcolepsy and insomnia that that have a major impact on quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings also add to the growing body of evidence that even simple model organisms can reveal fundamental mechanisms that govern life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;One Molecule, Two Jobs&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team focused on a chemical messenger called FLP-11. When a sleep neuron activates, it releases FLP-11. Such chemical messengers work like molecular “notes” that are passed between brain cells to deliver different commands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We knew that FLP-11 is essential to sleep but we didn’t know what message it delivers and to whom,” explains Prof. Bringmann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through genetic screening, the researchers identified a key receptor, called DMSR-1, that FLP-11 binds to deliver its message. If this receptor was missing from the brain, researchers observed that the worms slept significantly less. DMSR-1 turned out to be present in different types of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on which neuron received the message, the results were dramatically different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We discovered that FLP-11 activates DMSR-1 receptors in two completely different types of neurons,” says Lorenzo Rossi, a PhD student who conducted the experiments in the lab of Prof. Bringmann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found the receptor present in neurons that promote wakefulness. When activated by FLP-11, the receptor turns off the wakefulness neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This, in turn, helps the worm fall asleep. On the other hand, the receptor is also present in the sleep neuron itself. Here, it also turns it off, which ultimately wakes the animal back up,” explains Lorenzo Rossi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, the same chemical that puts the worm to sleep also helps wake it up again, simply by targeting different cells in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is an efficient mechanism that controls the start of sleep while also keeping its duration in check,” adds Prof. Bringmann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Universal Principle?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Unlike humans, &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; have much shorter sleep phases that last only around 20 minutes. However, sleep is such a fundamental biological process that many molecules and mechanisms involved in sleep are shared across species,” says Prof. Bringmann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We don’t yet know if the same sleep switch exists in humans, but it provides a promising clue in the search for mechanisms that control sleep in our species.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this sleep and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://tu-dresden.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Magdalena Gonciarz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://tu-dresden.de/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;TUD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Magdalena Gonciarz – TUD&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2025.03.039" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;The neuropeptide FLP-11 induces and self-inhibits sleep through the receptor DMSR-1 in &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” by Henrik Bringmann et al. &lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The neuropeptide FLP-11 induces and self-inhibits sleep through the receptor DMSR-1 in &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep is caused by the depolarization of sleep-active neurons, which secrete gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and neuropeptides such as conserved RFamide (c-terminal Arg-Phe-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; motif) neuropeptides to dictate when an organism falls asleep and when it wakes up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the mechanisms by which neurotransmission from sleep-active neurons induces sleep and determines the duration of sleep remain poorly understood. Sleep in &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt; crucially requires the single sleep-active RIS neuron, which induces sleep via the release of FLP-11 RFamide neuropeptides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, how RIS and FLP-11 control sleep is not well understood, as the receptor through which FLP-11 acts has yet to be identified. In this study, we discovered that RIS and FLP-11 control sleep through the G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt;-protein coupled receptor DroMyoSuppressin receptor related 1 (DMSR-1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using cell-specific knockdowns, we demonstrate that &lt;em&gt;dmsr-1&lt;/em&gt; induces sleep by acting in cholinergic neurons downstream of RIS activation. Pharmacological intervention indicates that inhibiting cholinergic signaling is necessary for sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consistently, DMSR-1 expression in cholinergic neurons is essential for core sleep functions, including protective gene expression and survival. In contrast, we found that &lt;em&gt;dmsr-1&lt;/em&gt; in RIS mediates negative feedback control during sleep that limits RIS calcium activation and the duration of sleep. Consequently, &lt;em&gt;dmsr-1&lt;/em&gt; in RIS inhibits protective gene expression and survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, DMSR-1 controls both the initiation and limitation of sleep, effectively coupling sleep induction with a sleep-stop signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RFamide neuropeptide-GPCR signaling might underlie similar dual mechanisms of sleep control in other species, and self-inhibition of sleep-active neurons might represent a conserved mechanism for limiting the duration of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 14:26:08 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMicEFVX3lxTE5Bb3ZYd3R3TEE5UkxUTVV4Y2lxUXhGenVJWnlmTGNaT1pTbTZ3MDRGZHVXUHNNTFlkWmFtVHlBY1FnT1BqeVFiUFpNdnJ5cGFqRDBNU0hyemxiakZ3RU9oNTZsMV8wQWd5WVJ0aEM2NG0</guid></item><item><title>神经科学家发现对杏仁核刺激的记忆反应存在个体差异- PsyPost | Neuroscientists find individual differences in memory response to amygdala stimulation - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMisAFBVV95cUxPMUxneDVIc1dNSVQwMTlKWkJ3ZTVrLUNvRnIwRTJPMUl4MGN4bjVBZDZxUXczcHNUVFFCNmUzbkp5OVF5eGNQREdGM1Y0c1RZMkx0MFJ6b2c4ZVJaTmhYUElzUXc4YkRSemJ3RXRLUzBheXJVNmViQU41T1Ita253RlRmdE5NZWJSM3owck5FRWMwYjFFbHF0MlVIR2R6VXItenhKZ2daMTRic2RFb2ZRTg?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13415-024-01250-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Cognitive, Affective, &amp;amp; Behavioral Neuroscience&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; provides evidence that electrical stimulation of the amygdala during learning can enhance long-term memory for neutral images—but only after a delay and not for everyone. The researchers found that this stimulation can help prioritize memories for later recall, but the effect varies widely across individuals. In fact, some participants experienced memory enhancement, while others saw a decline. The best predictor of whether stimulation helped or hurt was each person’s baseline memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study builds on a growing body of work exploring how the amygdala influences memory. While it’s well known that emotional events tend to be remembered better than neutral ones, this isn’t only because of their emotional content. It’s also because the brain, especially the amygdala, plays a role in prioritizing these memories for long-term storage. This prioritization process interacts with the hippocampus and other nearby regions that are responsible for encoding the details of experiences. But the researchers behind this study wanted to know whether it’s possible to stimulate the amygdala to improve memory even when emotional arousal isn’t involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a previous study, the same research team showed that stimulating the basolateral amygdala (BLA) at low electrical levels—levels that didn’t produce any conscious emotional sensation—could enhance memory for neutral images after 24 hours. That finding suggested it might be possible to separate the memory-boosting power of the amygdala from its usual role in processing emotions. The new study set out to test this idea in a larger sample and to examine why some people benefit from stimulation while others do not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, the researchers recruited 31 adults who were undergoing brain monitoring for treatment-resistant epilepsy. These patients had already undergone a procedure in which depth electrodes were implanted into various brain regions, including the amygdala, to help identify the origin of their seizures. This setup gave the research team a rare opportunity to directly stimulate the amygdala while participants were awake and performing memory tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant was shown a series of neutral images—pictures of objects—and asked to judge whether the object was more often found indoors or outdoors. On half of the trials, while the image was being shown, the researchers delivered a short burst of electrical stimulation to the BLA. On the other half, there was no stimulation. Importantly, the stimulation was below the threshold of awareness, and none of the participants reported feeling anything during the trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After viewing the images, participants were tested twice: once immediately after the session, and again 24 hours later. In line with the researchers’ predictions, there was no significant difference in memory performance at the immediate test. But at the 24-hour mark, the researchers found that participants remembered the stimulated images better than the non-stimulated ones—at least on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average, however, masked a striking degree of individual variation. Some participants showed strong memory enhancement after amygdala stimulation, others showed no change, and a few actually performed worse on stimulated trials. This led the researchers to investigate what personal factors might be driving these differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most consistent predictor was each person’s baseline memory performance, assessed before surgery using standard neuropsychological tests. People who scored lower on these baseline tests were more likely to experience a strong effect—whether positive or negative—from the stimulation. In contrast, individuals with high baseline memory tended to show little or no change. This suggests that stimulation may interact with existing memory function, enhancing weak systems or disrupting already well-functioning ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other factors also played a role. There were hints of sex differences, with males more likely to show strong memory enhancement and females more likely to show no effect or even impairment. However, these sex differences did not reach statistical significance in all analyses. Additionally, participants who showed more frequent abnormal brain activity (known as interictal epileptiform discharges, or IEDs) during the task tended to show greater variability in response to stimulation. This could mean that the brain’s baseline state during learning—its electrical activity and susceptibility to interference—affects how well stimulation works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The location of the stimulation electrode within the amygdala and its distance from nearby brain structures such as the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and perirhinal cortex was also examined. However, the researchers found no consistent relationship between proximity to these regions and memory outcomes. This was somewhat unexpected, given that past research has shown that stimulating certain parts of the medial temporal lobe can either help or harm memory, depending on the precise target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study’s findings point to the importance of personalizing neuromodulation strategies. While amygdala stimulation appears to hold promise as a tool for enhancing memory, especially in people with memory impairments, it’s clear that one-size-fits-all approaches are unlikely to be effective. Instead, understanding who is most likely to benefit—and under what conditions—will be key to developing safe and effective therapeutic uses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with any study involving neurosurgical patients, there are limitations. All of the participants had epilepsy, and many were taking medications that can affect memory. The sample size, while larger than previous work in this area, was still relatively small. Additionally, the researchers combined data from three slightly different sub-experiments that varied in how and when stimulation was delivered. Although this allowed them to examine a wider range of stimulation conditions, it also added complexity to the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also note that while their stimulation protocol did not produce subjective emotional effects, they can’t entirely rule out the possibility that it influenced unconscious emotional processes. Future studies could explore whether adjusting the intensity or timing of stimulation can further optimize memory outcomes, and whether these methods can be safely used in non-epileptic populations, including older adults or individuals with memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13415-024-01250-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Exploring individual differences in amygdala-mediated memory modulation&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Martina K.

If losing weight takes forever but you gain weight seemingly overnight, you might actually have health problems that are thwarting your efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angie Ehrenzweig is a good example of how necessary it is to overcome health problems first. Yes, she lost 100 pounds in one year — but the weight came off very slowly at first. When she showed up at &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=100lbs-April25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt;, she was struggling with fibromyalgia, extreme fatigue, insulin resistance, depression, systemic inflammation and metabolic syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After work, she had so little energy left that she would go home and sit in her recliner the rest of the evening. She could no longer go on hikes with her friends or spend quality time with her husband and children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Her first appointment and scan&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At her first appointment, Dr. Whit Roberts, D.C. of &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=100lbs-April25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; ran a specialized scan on her body. The scan is a non-invasive functional state assessment of the body which provides an immediate overview of the patient's physiology, stress, fatigue, risk factors, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts was immediately able to see many physiological challenges Angie was dealing with.  Reporting her impressions of the scan Angie said, "I was blown away. I couldn't believe how much information I got and how much I learned about my health. I doubt I would have learned more with 20 blood tests and an MRI."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to every appointment at Health Utah, patients fill out a proprietary questionnaire that can identify additional health problems that contribute to stubborn weight. The questionnaire is the result of Roberts' 28 years of experience and research. There is almost always a perfect correlation between the results of the scan and the questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts uses both of these to guide him through a 40-minute consultation and evaluation. Why so long? Roberts says, "The art of reviewing someone's health history is almost completely lost to medicine these days. If a test or image can't show a problem, doctors often ignore the patient's symptoms. This is really too bad. A wealth of information can be derived from listening to the patient. It simply takes a while to hear and see everything the patient has to share."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armed with all the information he needed, Roberts prescribed a protocol of health care and weight loss for Angie. Fortunately, most of the time, his protocols can address everything he identifies in the scan, the questionnaire and the consultation. This was the case with Angie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt; Photo: Health Utah&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time she had finished her care, she no longer suffered with the debilitating pain from fibromyalgia or struggled with crippling exhaustion. Her depression was gone. The inflammation all over her body and swelling in her legs were gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These were signs that the more serious health concerns of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome were resolved. Without resolving health issues first, such as insulin resistance, weight loss is very difficult. This is why Angie lost relatively little weight in the beginning of her program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is the program?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;How Roberts and his team at Health Utah addressed all of Angie's conditions is beyond the scope of this article. However, Roberts explained some of the protocols that can be employed for one of her conditions, that of insulin resistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With insulin resistance, receptors on the outside of every cell literally change shape and no longer allow insulin to attach. This is a problem since glucose, which fuels the cell, can only enter the cell if insulin attaches," Roberts says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With insulin resistance, the sugar that is supposed to enter the cells, instead stays in the bloodstream where it causes damage. In an effort to prevent this damage, the body takes the excess sugar and stores it as fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is why you gain weight and have a hard time losing weight with insulin resistance. It's also why you have to resolve it before you spend thousands of dollars and hours of effort to lose weight," Roberts continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many different causes of insulin resistance such as smoking and other lifestyle choices, poor diet, stress, toxins and metabolic disorders. As such there are many ways to address it. To address toxins, for example, Roberts and his team use herbs that upregulate phase one and phase two detoxification of the liver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplements are also often used to keep blood sugars and insulin levels from spiking in response to food and/or stress. For certain metabolic disorders, increasing the production of the enzyme AMP can help. AMP kinase, for example, can help to resensitize insulin receptors to insulin. "We do this through the use of infrared red light and heat therapy. Since the inflammatory responses of the body can increase the production and release of stress chemicals, the use of inflammation-lowering herbs can mitigate stress," Roberts says. This is also done by identifying and removing foods that are inflammatory from the diet. Roberts also recommends occasional fasting. If you can go longer periods of time with low levels of sugar and insulin in your blood, your receptors tend to become more receptive to insulin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;First steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roberts and his staff set aside over an hour for testing, evaluation and consultation. To discourage reserving a time and then not showing up, a small fee of $59 is collected prior to the appointment. Your first step then is to either call (801) 609-3478 or visit &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=100lbs-April25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; today to schedule your testing, evaluation and consultation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Special offer&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In any health or weight loss journey, it is essential to have the help of family and friends. In a British study, researchers found that both men and women had almost twice as much success losing weight when they did it with a partner. So Health Utah is offering this, their most popular weight loss package, for $59 for two people.  You and a friend can get tested, receive a 17-page report, take the proprietary survey and get a consultation with Dr. Roberts. The scan alone is normally $300 for one person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Call  (801) 609-3478 or visit &lt;a href="https://utcountyhealth.com/2-for-1-weight-loss?UTM_source=100lbs-April25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"&gt;Health Utah&lt;/a&gt; today to schedule your appointment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The opinions and conclusions expressed in this article are the sponsor's own and do not reflect the views or opinions of KSL.com.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are among the most well-known neurodevelopmental conditions, estimated to affect approximately 1–3% and 5–7% of the global population, respectively. While people diagnosed with ASD can experience difficulties with social communication, repetitive behaviors and a heightened sensitivity to sensory stimuli (e.g., lights, sounds, etc.), those diagnosed with ADHD are often prone to hyperactivity, impulsivity and inattention, which makes it harder for them to focus on tasks for extended periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;ADHD and autism often co-occur, with statistics estimating that 50–70% of individuals with ASD also present symptoms of ADHD. While several past neuroscience studies investigated these two distinct neurodevelopmental conditions, the similarities and differences between their neurobiological underpinnings remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the National Institutes of Health and King's College London recently carried out a large-scale &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/statistical+analysis/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;statistical analysis&lt;/a&gt; aimed at comparing the patterns of communication between different regions in the brains of individuals diagnosed with ASD with those observed in the brains of individuals with ADHD. Their findings, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44220-025-00431-5" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Nature Mental Health&lt;/i&gt;, suggest that although ASD and ADHD can appear together, they are associated with different brain connectivity patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Autism spectrum disorder (autism) and attention-deficit/&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/hyperactivity+disorder/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;hyperactivity disorder&lt;/a&gt; (ADHD) often co-occur, although it remains unclear whether these conditions share common neurobiological foundations or exhibit distinct alterations in resting-state brain connectivity," wrote Luke J. Norman, Gustavo Sudre and their colleagues in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We conducted a cross-sectional mega-analytic comparison of functional connectivity patterns linked to autism and ADHD traits in children and adolescents (ages 6–19 years; n = 10,168), with follow-up analyses considering autism (n = 764 autistic; n = 893 neurotypical) and ADHD (n = 2,026 ADHD; n = 2,409 neurotypical) diagnoses."&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;As part of their study, the researchers analyzed large amounts of clinical and brain imaging data collected as part of previous studies. This data was collected from over 12,732 children and adolescents diagnosed with either one or both developmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers looked at differences and similarities in various regions of the brains of individuals with ASD and ADHD, including the thalamus (a central relay station for sensory and motor signals) and the putamen (known to contribute to movement and learning), as well as various other networks of regions coordinating attention, emotions and self-awareness. Interestingly, they found that ASD was associated with weaker connections between some of these regions and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/neural+networks/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;neural networks&lt;/a&gt;, while ADHD was linked to stronger connections between the same regions and networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Autism traits and diagnosis were associated with reduced connectivity between the thalamus, putamen, salience/ventral attention and frontoparietal networks, whereas ADHD traits showed the opposite pattern," wrote Norman, Sudre and their colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Hyperconnectivity between the default mode and dorsal attention networks was observed in both autistic and ADHD groups relative to neurotypical individuals and associated with ADHD traits. Despite frequent co-occurrence, autism and ADHD traits exhibit distinct neural signatures, with small effect sizes indicating subtle associations."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the results of the large-scale analysis carried out by this research team suggest that although people with ASD can often also exhibit symptoms of ADHD, the two neurodevelopmental conditions have different neural signatures. This key observation could inform future studies focusing on the co-occurrence of the two neurodevelopmental disorders, while also potentially guiding the development of diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies that account for their different underlying functional connectivity patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

Over 48 months, patients who received targeted care saw a 15% reduction in dementia and a 16% drop in cognitive impairment risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intervention involved community healthcare workers helping patients reach blood pressure goals under 130/80 mm Hg. These findings support wider adoption of intensive blood pressure control to help combat the global dementia crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Significant Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; Intensive blood pressure reduction led to a 15% lower risk of dementia.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Widespread Study:&lt;/strong&gt; Over 33,000 people across 326 villages were included in the trial.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community-Based Strategy:&lt;/strong&gt; Non-physician healthcare workers helped patients meet target BP goals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Liaoning Clinical Research Center for Hypertensive Diseases&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dementia is the fifth leading cause of death across the globe. In the absence of curative treatments, the primary prevention of dementia through the reduction of risk factors has become a public health priority. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, definitive evidence supporting BP reduction for the primary prevention of dementia in hypertensive patients remains insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers from multiple universities have come together to form the China Rural Hypertension Control Project Phase-3 (CRHCP-3),which is one of the largest randomized effectiveness trials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing high blood pressure substantially lowers the risk of dementia and cognitive impairment without dementia, according to the 48-month results .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight the potential importance of widespread adoption of more intensive blood pressure control among patients with hypertension to reduce the global disease burden of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study comprised 33,995 individuals across 326 villages in rural China, with 17,407individuals in the “intervention” group and 16,588 in the usual care group being studied and followed up for after 48 months. Those in the intervention group were adopted&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the non-physician community healthcare providers (NPCHP) led multifaceted implementation strategy to reduce their blood pressure with the goal of reaching a systolic blood pressure (SBP, the first number in a blood pressure reading) of below 130 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure (DBP, the second number in a blood pressure reading) to under 80 mm Hg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers published their results in &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt; in April 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dementia has become a global public health crisis due to its high prevalence, increased mortality, and the significant financial and emotional burdens it places on patients, caregivers, and society as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Only a few randomized controlled trials have tested the effect of medications that reduce blood pressure on the risk of dementia, and none have looked at it as a primary trial endpoint, except for the SPRINT-MIND trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Intensive blood pressure reduction was associated with a non-significant 17% reduction in dementia events among SPRINT-MIND participants.” said Yingxian Sun, professor at the First Hospital of China Medical University and author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the 48-month-long study showed a reduction of 22.0 mm Hg in the SBP of those who were in the intervention group and 9.3 mm Hg in the DBP compared to the group who received usual care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This translates to around a 15% decrease in risk of all-cause dementia and a 16% lower risk for cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These findings provide additional motivation for patients with hypertension to reduce their blood pressure—not only to prevent cardiovascular disease, but also to lower their risk of dementia,” said Sun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the future, we will harness big data and artificial intelligence to enable early prediction of dementia and optimize individualized prevention and therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jiang He of the Department of Epidemiology, Department of Internal Medicine, Department of Neurology and the Peter O’Donnell Jr. Brain Institute, all at the UT Southwestern Medical Center, Chuansheng Zhao, Shanshan Zhong, Huayan Liu, Weiyu Teng and Xu Liu of the Department of Neurology at the First Hospital of China Medical University, Nanxiang Ouyang, Guozhe Sun, Lixia Qiao, Chang Wang, Songyue Liu and Yingxian Sun of the Department of Cardiology at the First Hospital of China Medical University, Ruihai Yang of the Hanzhong People’s Hospital, Chunxia Zhao of the Divison of Cardiology at the Tongji Medical College of Huazhong Univeristy of Science and Technology, Chung-Shiuan Chen of the Tulan University Translational Science Institute and Jeff D.

95% CI 0.76 to 0.95; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0035).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, serious adverse events occurred less frequently in the intervention group (risk ratio: 0.94; 95% CI 0.91 to 0.98; &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.0006).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This cluster-randomized trial indicates that intensive BP reduction is effective in lowering the risk of all-cause dementia in patients with hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03527719.&lt;/p&gt;

Dr Boidin says he also has evidence that vaping impairs people’s levels of fitness, even in young vapers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Paragraph_paragraph-text__PVKlh "&gt;He believes vaping can actually be more dangerous than smoking because it’s much harder to know when to stop. “Smokers tend to go outside and smoke, and once a cigarette is finished they have to light up another to keep going.

&lt;p&gt;A breakthrough study led by the &lt;em&gt;National Institutes of Health (NIH)&lt;/em&gt; reveals a powerful new tool for tracking the consumption of ultra-processed foods — not by food diaries or interviews, but through the molecular whispers in our blood and urine.  The method relies on what might seem like a routine test but quietly unveils more than participants may realize — offering a biochemical glimpse into diets dominated by junk food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-5"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="code-block code-block-2"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="5777932750" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1004560&amp;amp;utm_source=pr&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=plos006" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Published on May 20, 2025, in &lt;em&gt;PLOS Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the study — &lt;em&gt;Identification and validation of poly-metabolite scores for diets high in ultra-processed food: An observational study and post-hoc randomized controlled crossover-feeding trial&lt;/em&gt; — introduces a method to quantify diet quality with biological precision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Molecules Tell the Truth When Memory Fails&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a sweeping investigation, NIH researchers developed poly-metabolite scores — composite molecular fingerprints from blood and urine samples — capable of estimating how much energy an individual derives from ultra-processed foods (UPFs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Their approach draws from two datasets:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 12-month observational study involving 718 U.S. adults aged 50 to 74, who provided biospecimens and detailed food logs.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A controlled feeding trial at the &lt;em&gt;NIH Clinical Center&lt;/em&gt; involving 20 adult volunteers, who alternated between two-week diets consisting of either 80% UPFs or 0% UPFs, while living on-site under medical supervision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;strong&gt;machine learning&lt;/strong&gt;, the team analyzed over &lt;strong&gt;1,000 distinct metabolites&lt;/strong&gt; — byproducts of metabolism — and discovered recurring chemical signatures associated with high UPF intake.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Junk Food Leaves a Chemical Trail&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers showed that poly-metabolite scores could accurately distinguish between ultra-processed and unprocessed diet phases within the same individual, with no need for subjective reporting. These biological markers do not track specific products — like sodas or frozen meals — but instead identify &lt;strong&gt;metabolic patterns predictive of habitual UPF consumption&lt;/strong&gt;. As Dr. &lt;em&gt;Erikka Loftfield&lt;/em&gt;, lead investigator from the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/" data-type="link" data-id="https://www.cancer.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, explains:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;


&lt;ins class="adsbygoogle" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6966113680805338" data-ad-slot="4788484402" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;We found this signature that was sort of predictive of this dietary pattern that’s high in ultraprocessed food and not just a specific food item here and there.&lt;/em&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;UPFs, defined in the study as industrially manufactured, ready-to-eat or ready-to-heat products, are typically high in calories but low in essential nutrients. In the United States, they now account for nearly 60% of total caloric intake.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Paving the Way for Smarter Nutrition Science&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/the-oldest-human-construction-ever-discovered-is-3x-older-than-egypts-great-pyramid-at-least-23000-years-old/" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="80857" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Traditional diet research&lt;/a&gt; often depends on &lt;strong&gt;self-reported data&lt;/strong&gt;, which can be skewed by poor memory or misreporting. As Loftfield emphasizes:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Metabolomics provides an exciting opportunity to not only improve our methods for objectively measuring complex exposures like diet and intake of ultra-processed foods, but also to understand the mechanisms by which diet might be impacting health.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;There’s a need for both a more objective measure and potentially also a more accurate measure.&lt;/em&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research offers a path forward for analyzing archived biospecimens from earlier studies, enabling a &lt;strong&gt;retrospective assessment&lt;/strong&gt; of diet quality, even when food logs were incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="code-block code-block-3"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Decoding Junk Food’s Long-Term Impact Through Blood Science&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also opens the door for evaluating associations between UPF consumption and long-term health risks — such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease — although this particular study did not aim to prove causality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers recommend extending the analysis to younger age groups and non-Western diets, to ensure the score’s reliability across food cultures and levels of processing. The work forms part of the &lt;em&gt;intramural program&lt;/em&gt; at the NIH’s &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/terrorism-as-a-cancer-does-this-metaphor-work-for-india/" data-type="post" data-id="61776" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;, conducted within the NIH Clinical Center — the world’s largest dedicated biomedical research hospital. As more of the world shifts toward &lt;strong&gt;industrialized food systems&lt;/strong&gt;, the ability to decode dietary intake from biological samples could change how we study — and regulate — nutrition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;We’re sort of trapped in this industrial food-production system where we all eat ultra-processed food&lt;/em&gt;,” &lt;em&gt;Kevin Hall&lt;/em&gt;, co-author of the study, told &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It’s quite hard for most people to go back to fresh food, because our food systems are now set up like this.&lt;/em&gt;“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Same-old salad. Same-old salmon. Same-old pasta dish. Sometimes, however, all it takes is a new ingredient to change everything. One favorite? Tahini. Not only is it delicious, but it’s also high in protein, minerals, healthy fats, and antioxidants. And if that isn’t enough to convince you, consider this: Beyoncé &lt;a data-offer-url="https://people.com/food/beyonce-jayz-22-days-vegan-kale-salad-recipe/" class="external-link" data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://people.com/food/beyonce-jayz-22-days-vegan-kale-salad-recipe/"}' href="https://people.com/food/beyonce-jayz-22-days-vegan-kale-salad-recipe/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;apparently&lt;/a&gt; uses tahini as an ingredient in one of her go-to salad dressings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is tahini?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tahini, also known as tahina, is a paste made from hulled, ground sesame &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/seed-cycling" target="_blank"&gt;seeds&lt;/a&gt;. It has a soft, creamy consistency and is made by mixing roasted and ground white sesame seeds with olive oil, avocado oil, or sesame oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You probably know tahini as one of the main ingredients in hummus, but it’s also present in other classic Middle Eastern dishes such as halva with almonds and pistachios and baba ganoush. Many dishes from North Africa and parts of Asia also feature tahini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does tahini taste like?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flavor of tahini is mildly nutty and just a tiny bit bitter. Its neutrality, richness, and depth of flavor make it suitable for dishes that range from savory to sweet. It has a smooth, creamy texture similar to thin &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/almond-butter-or-peanut-butter-healthier" target="_blank"&gt;almond butter or peanut butter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;One tablespoon of tahini has:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Calories: 89&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Protein: 3 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Carbohydrates: 3 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fat: 8 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fiber: 2 g&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Copper: 27% of the Daily Value (DV)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Selenium: 9% of the DV&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Phosphorus: 9% of the DV&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Iron: 7% of the DV&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zinc: 6% of the DV&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Calcium: 5% of the DV&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the health benefits of tahini?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tahini is high in &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/how-a-nutritionist-eats-100g-of-protein-every-day" target="_blank"&gt;protein&lt;/a&gt;, antioxidants, healthy fats, and contains essential minerals such as calcium, selenium, iron, and zinc. Below, a breakdown of some of the benefits of tahini.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Contraindications&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tahini is safe for most people to consume, but should be avoided by those who are allergic to sesame. As it is rich in omega 6, it is important that it is always balanced by adequate amounts of omega 3, to avoid the onset of inflammation—so be sure to eat it as part of a balanced diet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to use tahini&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tahini is versatile, flavorful, and easy to use. It adds a dose of extra protein, minerals, and flavor to nearly anything and makes a tasty, plant-based substitute for dairy, butter, or cream. As mentioned, &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/tag/celebrity/beyonce" target="_blank"&gt;Beyoncé&lt;/a&gt; uses it in a dressing made with olive oil, lemon juice, grated ginger, chopped parsley, Tabasco, and shoyu or soy sauce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-bkChBi byNLHx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use tahini as you would any other nut butter—spread it onto toasted bread, drizzle over avocado toast, spread it onto whole-grain crackers, or use it on a spread in sandwiches. For a quick sweet and savory snack, spread tahini over spelt crackers with a drizzle of honey, sliced banana, and a sprinkle of &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/cinnamon-benefits" target="_blank"&gt;cinnamon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiYkFVX3lxTE5XR2hkUG5mZHFnV2Z5eWZYaXB6X1VObmlRcm9zM2RSV0NYc2JyNWx3eVNfVXVLck9SVHNkQThHeTU4cUdJYVVlenE0X2tWSkI3YTUtVUYzQTBKUHpmRExObktR</guid></item><item><title>大脑“重置波”可以解释ECT如何快速缓解抑郁症-神经科学新闻 | Brain ‘Reset Wave’ May Explain How ECT Rapidly Relieves Depression - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib0FVX3lxTE4zSVZtU1JSMExydWZIRC1rSlEyb3hFZW5DTER2RVB3Z0ZXRm1QOV9hRU9oMXRsLTZpTWlvUC1TUDR2X2t1LTg0b2NObjV6RC02TXl2bTNBbXVpQ1NNVC1pY0V0VF9ha0lUZVdJM0M1WQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), long misunderstood due to outdated portrayals, remains the most effective treatment for severe, treatment-resistant mental illness. While traditionally thought to work solely through induced seizures, new research reveals that ECT also triggers a second brain event: cortical spreading depolarization (CSD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This slow-moving brain wave acts as a “reset” mechanism, affecting nearly all neurons it passes, offering a possible explanation for ECT’s powerful therapeutic effects. With tools like optical neuroimaging, researchers now aim to use CSD as a biomarker for personalized, precision-based ECT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beyond Seizures:&lt;/strong&gt; ECT induces a second key event—cortical spreading depolarization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain Reset Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; CSD may explain ECT’s fast, widespread impact on brain function.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toward Precision ECT:&lt;/strong&gt; Researchers aim to use CSD and neuroimaging for individualized treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Pennsylvania&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ECT, or electroconvulsive therapy, uses brief, noninvasive electrical stimulation of the brain to induce a seizure. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite an outdated pop culture moniker (electroshock therapy) that often paints the treatment in a negative light, ECT has been proven to be a safe and highly effective treatment, offering rapid relief from severe symptoms when medications have failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110532"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ECT-depression-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ECT-depression-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ECT-depression-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ECT-depression-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ECT-depression-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ECT-depression-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ECT-depression-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ECT-depression-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ECT-depression-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ECT-depression-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ECT-depression-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ECT-depression-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ECT-depression-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ECT-depression-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/ECT-depression-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;“A CSD wave is a kind of hard reset for the brain and has the potential to explain many of the clinical effects of ECT,” Rosenthal says. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“People don’t think of ECT as ‘modern medicine,’ but it remains the gold standard intervention for treatment-resistant depression, psychosis, catatonia, bipolar mania, and more,” says Zach Rosenthal, a third-year resident in psychiatry at Penn’s Perelman School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosenthal is leading a group that published new findings which challenge a long-held assumption that the seizure induced by ECT is the treatment’s ultimate outcome, potentially changing the way the treatment is administered and viewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group’s findings, published in &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;, find that immediately after seizure, ECT induces a second major brain event, known as cortical spreading depolarization (CSD), a slow-moving, high-amplitude traveling wave of neuronal depolarization that resets virtually every neuron in its path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A CSD wave is a kind of hard reset for the brain and has the potential to explain many of the clinical effects of ECT,” Rosenthal says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a modern neuroscience tool called optical neuroimaging (a non-invasive tool that uses light to measure brain activity), the team was able to demonstrate that CSD occurs after ECT using specialized tools like optical neuroimaging to detect them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ECT is moving toward a precision medicine approach, using brain-based biomarkers to guide individualized treatment decisions,” Rosenthal says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve known for decades that stimulation parameters and seizure intensity can predict therapeutic efficacy of ECT, but we didn’t know why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Now we are testing whether modern tools like optical CSD detection, neuroimaging, and computational modeling can guide us towards personalized ECT dosing to target specific outcomes in the brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this ECT, depression, and neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Zach Rosenthal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Zach Rosenthal – University of Pennsylvania&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59900-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Electroconvulsive therapy generates a postictal wave of spreading depolarization in mice and humans&lt;/a&gt;” by Zach Rosenthal et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electroconvulsive therapy generates a postictal wave of spreading depolarization in mice and humans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a fast-acting, highly effective, and safe treatment for medication-resistant depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically, the clinical benefits of ECT have been attributed to generating a controlled seizure; however, the underlying neurobiology is understudied and unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using optical neuroimaging of neural activity and hemodynamics in a mouse model of ECT, we demonstrated that a second brain event follows seizure: cortical spreading depolarization (CSD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that ECT pulse parameters and electrode configuration directly shaped the wave dynamics of seizure and subsequent CSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To translate these findings to human patients, we used non-invasive diffuse optical monitoring of cerebral blood flow and oxygenation during routine ECT treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We observed that human brains reliably generate hyperemic waves after ECT seizure which are highly consistent with CSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results challenge a long-held assumption that seizure is the primary outcome of ECT and point to new opportunities for optimizing ECT stimulation parameters and treatment outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers found that unhealthy behaviors common in the evening, such as poor sleep, smoking, and drinking, may explain part of this risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study showed that 25% of cognitive decline could be linked to these habits, especially among higher-educated individuals who often face early work schedules that clash with their natural rhythms. While chronotype is largely genetic, aligning daily routines with one’s biological clock may help protect long-term brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chronotype Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Evening types showed faster cognitive decline over 10 years.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Behavioral Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Risk is partly explained by more smoking, drinking, and poor sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Working against your natural sleep rhythm may worsen brain health.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;UMCG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you a morning or an evening person? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who stay up at night and go to bed late are more likely to suffer cognitive decline than morning people, UMCG research shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘The good news is that you can partly influence this cognitive decline by adjusting your behaviour,’ says researcher Ana Wenzler, whose research contributes to dementia prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-110528"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/night-owls-cognition-neuroscince.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/night-owls-cognition-neuroscince-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/night-owls-cognition-neuroscince-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/night-owls-cognition-neuroscince-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/night-owls-cognition-neuroscince-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/night-owls-cognition-neuroscince-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/night-owls-cognition-neuroscince-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/night-owls-cognition-neuroscince.jpg" alt="This shows a person working early in the morning and one working at night." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/night-owls-cognition-neuroscince.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/night-owls-cognition-neuroscince-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/night-owls-cognition-neuroscince-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/night-owls-cognition-neuroscince-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/night-owls-cognition-neuroscince-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/night-owls-cognition-neuroscince-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/05/night-owls-cognition-neuroscince-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The conclusion: evening people decline cognitively faster than morning people. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because we are getting older, there are more and more people with dementia. Within a large national study, the BIRD-NL project, the UMCG, together with many partners, is researching ways to prevent dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘The fact is that your brain deteriorates after the age of 40, says Wenzler. ‘We study which lifestyle or other factors can reduce the risk of dementia.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is your chronotype?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wenzler’s area of research is sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Using Lifelines data, I look at people’s sleep rhythms. Are you an early bird or a night owl? It’s hard to adjust what your biological clock – your so-called chronotype – is, but you can adjust your life to it as best you can. In my research, I looked at whether your chronotype affects your cognition through behavior.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on questionnaires that Lifelines participants filled in about their sleep times, Wenzler was able to determine the extent to which people are extreme early or late sleepers, and everything in between.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She then looked at the results of a cognitive function test over a 10-year period: how did early scores differ from scores 10 years later?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;More frequent unhealthy behaviour in the evening&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conclusion: evening people decline cognitively faster than morning people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Unhealthy behavior such as smoking, drinking and unhealthy eating happens more often in the evening’, says Wenzler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘In our study, we also saw this: evening people smoke and drink more often and exercise less. 25% of the risk of cognitive decline can be explained from our research by smoking and poor sleep.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the difference was found mostly in higher-educated people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘That probably has to do with their sleep rhythm. They are often people who have to go back to work early in the morning and are therefore more likely to sleep too short, giving their brains too little rest.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Genetic evolution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wenzler, herself more of an early bird a night owl, explains how people’s biological clocks are genetically altered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Children are morning people. That changes when you reach puberty, when you become an evening person. Around your 20s, that gradually shifts back towards morning people for most people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘By the age of 40, most people are morning people again. But this is certainly not the case for everyone. In this way, evening people deviate from the norm’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Work against your body as little as possible&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is little you can do about being an evening person. That is why Wenzler recommends working against your body as little as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘You can try to go to sleep earlier, but if your body is not yet producing melatonin (sleep hormone, ed.) it will not work: your body simply does not want to sleep yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘We suspect that lower- or middle-educated people are more likely to have a job that allows them to take their sleep rhythm into account, such as a job in the hospitality industry or one with night shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘If this is not possible, your brain does not get enough rest and you are more likely to adopt bad habits. It would be nice if more consideration was given to evening people who now have to work early: for example, by giving them the option of starting later.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Follow-up research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Wenzler’s research continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘We are now investigating whether evening people are more likely to develop dementia. Faster cognitive decline in middle age does not necessarily mean a higher risk of dementia. With our research, we hope to find out more about this. This will ultimately help us to be able to give people informed advice on how to try to prevent dementia.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this chonotype and cognition research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fd97d38fd391d38a988e8e98918ebd88909e9ad39391" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Joost Wessels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://umcg.nl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UMCG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Joost Wessels- UMCG&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tjpad.2025.100168" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Chronotype as a potential risk factor for cognitive decline: The mediating role of sleep quality and health behaviours in a 10-year follow-up study&lt;/a&gt;” by Ana Wenzler et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chronotype as a potential risk factor for cognitive decline: The mediating role of sleep quality and health behaviours in a 10-year follow-up study&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cesectitle0002"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With rising life expectancies and ageing populations worldwide, preserving cognitive health is an urgent global priority. Chronotype could be a potential risk factor for cognitive decline, potentially through mediators sleep quality, alcohol intake, physical activity, and smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cesectitle0003"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study used data from participants aged 40 years and older from the Lifelines cohort study (&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 23,798). Chronotype, assessed with the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire, was included as a continuous score of mid-point sleep corrected for sleep debt on workdays. Multiple linear regression examined the association between chronotype and cognitive decline, including moderation by age, educational attainment, and sex. The KHB-method was applied to test mediation by sleep quality, alcohol intake, physical activity, and smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cesectitle0004"&gt;Outcomes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cognition was assessed with the Ruff Figural Fluency Test (RFFT), measuring non-verbal fluency and executive functioning. Cognitive decline was calculated by subtracting the RFFT sum score at baseline from the 10-year follow-up score.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cesectitle0005"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronotype was associated with cognitive decline. Educational attainment, but not age or sex, moderated the relationship. No significant associations were observed in the low- (0.07, 95 % CI: -0.44, 0.57) or middle- (-0.41, 95 % CI: -0.88, 0.06) educational groups. In the high-educational group each one-hour increase in chronotype corresponded to a 0.80-point decline in cognition per decade (95 % CI: -1.34, -0.26). In this group, sleep quality and current smoking mediated 13.52 % and 18.64 % of the association, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cesectitle0006"&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chronotype was associated with greater decline in non-verbal fluency and executive functioning among higher educated participants, highlighting the importance of targeted prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cesectitle0007"&gt;Funding&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This work is part of the BIRD-NL consortium funded by the Dutch Medical Research Council, ZonMw (Dementia research program) project number:10,510,032,120,005.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sat, 31 May 2025 12:32:49 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE96UzlYejRiZTFtR0ZCWG9NUjZBa2NKbzhxbWxZNmJxVEozNk9aaERqemM1YlNUOUstcnY5ankzUUpWRWowaU5sd05rdV9DekEweUVKLXRaNVJVM2s4QjBHRlFJTVFJeDQ</guid></item><item><title>一种医疗状况颠覆了我的生活。然后一位医生说了6个我从未想过会听到的令人震惊的话。- HuffPost | A Medical Condition Upended My Life.

Nurses monitor my vitals and check to see how open my breathing passages are. Technically, I could die within the next hour because I’ve ingested peanuts — the thing I’m most allergic to — but I did it on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why would I have tested fate this way? Because I’m hoping to never face the possibility of anaphylaxis from peanuts again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been deathly allergic to being exposed to even minuscule amounts of peanuts for as long as I can remember. That may sound dramatic, but they have killed people. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/29/cookie-recall-death-lawsuit-stew-leonards/73895980007/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="25-year-old Orla Ruth Baxendale died" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="68239db1e4b021b50649df1f" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/29/cookie-recall-death-lawsuit-stew-leonards/73895980007/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;25-year-old Orla Ruth Baxendale died&lt;/a&gt; after eating cookies that did not list peanuts in their ingredients, but did contain them. Although she carried multiple EpiPens, they were not enough to counter the effects of the allergen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been terrified of heartbreaking stories like Baxendale’s for as long as I can remember. When I was 13, I ruined my first kiss by pushing the guy away and crying, “You haven’t eaten any peanuts today, have you?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I eventually found a supportive partner willing to give up peanuts for my safety. He forewent cuisines, restaurants and trips to countries that often use the nut, and obsessively began to read the fine print on food packages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I traveled to Philadelphia in 2016 to meet with an allergist about my condition, but he refused to “challenge” me to determine how allergic I was. This process involves eating a tiny bit of peanut in a medical setting and waiting to see if you react, and if so, how badly. Instead, he told me I would never be able to overcome my allergy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may seem like a peanut allergy is manageable, since many foods do not contain them, but what most people don’t realize is that I’ve experienced ridicule, embarrassment and rejection most of my life because of my condition. Instead of having fond memories of attending birthday parties as a kid, I remember being mortified because I was forced to refuse cake to avoid a potential reaction. As a teen, I was berated by flight attendants for keeping them from being able to pass out peanuts to the rows around me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one flight, a passenger made sure I was aware just how disappointed he was to be seated near me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The only thing I look forward to when I’m flying is getting my pack of peanuts, and now I can’t have them,” he said loudly and angrily as I tried to disappear into my seat and remain hidden for the rest of the flight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve also been asked to leave or refused service by restaurants multiple times. In my early 20s, I was eager to go to dinner with new coworkers, only to learn the restaurant wasn’t comfortable serving me anything. I spent the rest of the evening awkwardly sitting at the table, sipping bottled water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, I turned down multiple invitations to one of the most popular restaurants in our town because the one time I tried to dine there, they told me they couldn’t make me anything, even though I only spotted one or two menu items containing peanuts. They weren’t even comfortable with me ordering a cocktail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s close quarters in our kitchen, and we don’t want to get sued!” I was warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even worse than that are the group trips I haven’t been able to take. I once requested time off from work and booked travel to attend the New Orleans Jazz Fest with friends. Right before we were supposed to leave, one of my (so-called) friends told me I could no longer go with them because too many people were concerned that eating out with me would be too hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things got even more unbelievable last Thanksgiving when my fiancé and I purchased our first home together... only to discover that our next-door neighbor regularly buys 40-pound bags of peanuts to feed to squirrels in the neighborhood. Somehow, we hadn’t seen any signs of this when we toured the house, but once we moved in, we found thousands of peanut shells around his property — more than I’ve ever seen in one place in my life. Peanut shells don’t disintegrate easily, so they’d been collecting for years, and our backyard was a deathtrap for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;“After we moved into our new home, we discovered the yard was covered in peanut shells,” the author writes. “They had accumulated over the years because our neighbor fed peanuts to the wildlife.”&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Summer Austin"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Summer Austin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;After living in our new house for a few weeks, my eye swelled up after I toweled off my dog’s paws. I wanted to love my new home — and I didn’t want to worry that I was constantly at risk of an allergic reaction or even death — so I called a new allergist. That’s when I heard the six most shocking words a doctor has ever told me: “I’ll cure you of your allergy.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;After so many years of being told there was nothing I could do to overcome my condition, I was skeptical, but excited. Could I really be cured? I was willing to do whatever it took to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later, I began Oral Immunotherapy, or OIT. This process involves ingesting 28 different doses of peanuts over seven months and increasing the strength of the dose each week. After I consumed the peanuts, I was monitored for a reaction by a medical professional in my doctor’s office and, if everything went OK, I took home a week’s worth of doses to eat each night — with Benadryl and an EpiPen nearby just in case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;My doctor told me he has desensitized almost 300 people over the last six years, 150 of whom had peanut allergies, but OIT also works for milk, wheat, soy, egg and tree nut allergies as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the first dose of peanuts I was given was practically microscopic, I was still terrified to eat them. I was afraid that ingesting this substance I had been desperately avoiding my entire life would make me feel like I was dying, and I worried I would not be able to distinguish between a panic attack and a real reaction. This did happen during the first few doses I ate. Anytime I thought about what I was doing or a nurse asked how I was feeling, I immediately felt my throat start to tighten. My doctor reassured me that they would be able to tell what was going on in my body even if I couldn’t. They closely monitored my vitals, checked how open my air passages were, and listened to my breathing. My doctor also suggested I bring a distraction, like my laptop to watch my favorite show, or a book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first few doses I took were so small my body couldn’t physically react to them, but they served to introduce my body to this foreign substance and initiate the therapy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;“A week’s worth of take-home doses carefully measured by the nurses at my appointments,” the author writes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Summer Austin"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Summer Austin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had my first reaction about halfway through the process. It wasn’t what I was expecting — my mouth wasn’t itchy, my eyes didn’t swell and my throat didn’t close. Instead, about 40 minutes into my second dose of the day (in the early phases, I could take multiple doses a day, with a one-hour wait period between each one), I began to feel a lot of stomach pain. I started sweating and alerted one of the nurses that I wasn’t doing well. She went to get the doctor, and before I knew what was happening, I vomited. A few minutes later, I felt totally normal. My body had rid itself of the allergen and was no longer distressed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of my reaction, I had to retreat to a lower dose. When I tried to increase my doses again, I experienced unpleasant side effects like nausea and acid reflux. It took a few months to get things ironed out, so I stayed on the same dose for much longer than a week to prevent another reaction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I reached the one-gram mark for peanuts, we celebrated! Now I was “bite proof,” which meant I could eat anything labeled “may contain peanuts” or “manufactured using the same equipment as peanuts,” and not be at risk of having a severe reaction. I could also safely eat in restaurants where cross-contamination might be an issue because I was not likely to react. However, I was told I still shouldn’t eat anything with peanuts, since there’s a limit to my tolerance, and my goal wasn’t to “free eat” them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;“Now that I’ve finished my OIT course and reached my maintenance dose, I carefully weigh 5 grams of peanuts to take every day,” the author writes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__credit" aria-label="Image Credit: Courtesy of Summer Austin"&gt;&lt;p class="credit-container"&gt;&lt;span class="credit"&gt;Courtesy of Summer Austin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I moved beyond the one-gram doses, I had to slow down again, but after nearly a year, I finally reached my goal of a five-gram maintenance dose, which is the equivalent of one teaspoon of peanut butter or five peanuts. To keep my tolerance indefinitely, I will need to ingest this dose every day for three years, and then after that, at least once a month for the rest of my life. If I took an entire year off from eating peanuts, my allergy could return. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;OIT was a significant investment of my time and emotions, but it changed my life. I no longer have the constant fear that a mistake or someone else’s carelessness could kill me.

    &lt;p&gt;Karla Flores was 18 when she started experiencing double vision. She knew something was wrong but struggled to find a diagnosis. Finally, she saw an ophthalmologist who referred her to a neurosurgeon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flores, then 19, was diagnosed with a chordoma wrapped around her brain stem. Chordomas are incredibly rare — only about 300 are diagnosed per year in the United States, according to &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17916-chordoma" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;the Cleveland Clinic&lt;/a&gt; — and they are slow-growing, malignant tumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tumor was putting pressure on multiple of Flores' cranial nerves, said Dr. Mohamed Labib, a neurosurgeon at the University of Maryland Medical Center who led her treatment. Labib developed a complex surgical plan that required two surgeries to remove the tumor without damaging the delicate nerves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Flores underwent an MRI the morning of the first surgery, the technician positioned the camera a little lower than necessary. When looking at the scans, Labib realized Flores had a second chordoma. This one was at the top of her spine, at the front of her spinal cord. It was wrapped around her spinal cord and had invaded the vertebrae in her neck, Labib said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They told me if they hadn't seen it, I could have been paralyzed," Flores told CBS News.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                  &lt;span class="embed__caption"&gt;The two chordomas. Karla Flores was first diagnosed with a chordoma on her brain stem (the center red mass). She was then diagnosed with a second chordoma on her spinal cord (the lower red mass).&lt;/span&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the startling discovery, Labib decided to go ahead with the procedures to remove Flores' first chordoma. The tumor was successfully removed through a traditional neurosurgery and another procedure that went through Flores' nose. &lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In between the procedures, Labib studied the location of the second tumor. In most cases, he would make an incision in the spine to approach the tumor from the back, but the chordoma's location meant that wasn't an option. Going through Flores' nose again wouldn't give him enough space to operate. One colleague even suggested that there was nothing they could do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I spoke to colleagues, and one of them said 'You're not gonna cure her from this,' basically, maybe she should be more of a palliative care patient," said Labib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Palliative care refers to making a terminally ill patient comfortable for their last days. "I wasn't very enthusiastic about that," Labib added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Developing a unique surgical plan &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labib continued to study Flores' scans and look for ways to reach the second chordoma. While considering approaching it through her nose, he realized the cheekbone between her nose and eye was one of the obstacles blocking him from reaching the tumor. That gave him an idea: What if he approached through the side of Flores' eye? &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had done it for a surgery several years prior, but never to remove a spinal tumor. Labib spent weeks practicing the technique, which he called the "third nostril" approach, in UMMC's neurosurgery laboratory. He used cadaver heads and skull models to ensure that he could safely reach and operate on the tumor. He and other members of Flores' team spent weeks working through potential problems, including ensuring that they could create a surgical opening without damaging her eyeball and modifying surgical instruments so they would work for the procedure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

                          &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figcaption&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he was confident in the approach, Labib told Flores and her family about the plan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Her mother cried. Karla was emotional. Her father, he's not an emotional guy, but you could see from his silence he was concerned," Labib remembered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flores said she trusted Labib and approved the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was scared I wasn't going to see my parents again, because you never know what's going to happen when you go inside the surgery," she admitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the operating room, facial plastic and reconstructive surgeon Dr. Kalpesh T. Vakharia cut through the membrane that protects the eye inside the lower eyelid and removed the bottom of Flores' eye socket and a portion of her cheekbone. That allowed Labib to reach the operating site. It also left Flores with no external scars, Vakharia said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the bones were removed, Labib and head and neck surgeon Dr. Andrea Hebert drilled through Flores' vertebrae to reach the tumor. They dissected it carefully, following the procedure they had developed in the lab. By the time they were done, the chordoma was entirely removed, Labib said. &lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It was perfect," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once that was done, Vakharia rebuilt Flores' eye socket with a titanium plate and rebuilt her cheek with bone from her hip. The process took about 20 hours, Labib said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Each step is an accomplishment" &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chordoma was removed, but Flores still had more treatment to come. A spinal surgeon stabilized the vertebrae that had been affected during the surgery. Six weeks later, she underwent radiation treatment to ensure there was no cancer in her body. Nearly a year after completing treatment, Flores has no evidence of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treatment was followed by rehabilitative therapy. Flores, now 20, struggles to move her left eye because of nerve damage from the chordoma, but is continuing to work on it in physical therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="embed embed--type-image is-image embed--float-none embed--size-medium"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flores said that when she is feeling better, she wants to go to school to become a manicurist. She has follow-up appointments at UMMC every few months. Her biggest struggle right now is medical bills: She said she owes about $600,000. A GoFundMe has raised just a few thousand dollars. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I keep reminding myself to take one day at a time and know that each step is an accomplishment. I'm also glad I stood my ground and kept looking for help until I found it," Flores said in an emailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labib said he hopes the procedure can be used to help operate on other difficult-to-reach tumors. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I think this opens a new corridor for approaching tumors that are in the upper cervical (or high part of the) spine," Labib said. "I think this third nostril approach is a smaller, easier and cleaner approach, and I think it's going to really take on these difficult tumors in front of the spinal cord."  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="32" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbazi2hv007a3b76zsg7u5wj@published"&gt;My partner and I have been together for seven years. He’s 31 and I’m 27. Our relationship started very quickly, and we moved in together less than a year after first meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="78" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbazckwl000l3b76t5hoq6pu@published"&gt;Last month, I found out that he had been having a sexual affair with a mutual friend of ours. Both of them are frequent social drinkers and can drink quite heavily. I know they were both drunk whenever they hooked up. My partner’s version of events changed several times, but he is now claiming that the friend took advantage of him while they were drunk. I have been too angry to hear the other side of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

  

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="234" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbazckzo000m3b76g2qavtud@published"&gt;I have also heard from others that the friend has shared details of what happened that my partner did not tell me. Can anything be gained by hearing these other details? For example, I know my partner climaxed during this affair, and I am not sure if that would be possible if he was so drunk as to be in a taken advantage of state. Could a guy get hard and come if he didn’t want it but was too drunk to say no? I really want to believe my partner, but I’m not sure. I don’t think he would go so far as to co-opt the Me Too movement, but things don’t really add up. There’s the fact that the affair went on for some time. I have also come to learn that my partner was the one who provided the alcohol that supposedly led to them fooling around each time. My partner also continued to invite this friend over for drinks after the affair was over, both for times I was home and for times that I wasn’t. He only claimed that he was taken advantage of after I and other people found out that he had cheated on me, and after his initial lies covering the extent of the affair fell apart. I also know that he deleted text messages between him and the friend after I asked to read them.&lt;/p&gt;

I was betrayed by two people I trusted and don’t know what to do. I am trying to make things work, but not sure if I believe anything he says anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="92" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbazdlh0001s3b760hbow9lj@published"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dear Naïve and Confused,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don’t know if this constitutes naïveté on your part, because you have collected plenty of pieces to suspect something is amiss and, indeed, effectively have written in for confirmation. Let’s recap: Your partner changed his story “several times,” and you came to find out that it was still incomplete. After the cheating, he continued to invite your mutual friend over, including times when you were home. When a story he told fell apart, he pivoted to a victim narrative. He also destroyed evidence that you requested to review.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="128" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbazcl6d000p3b762jpyxk45@published"&gt;You are partnered with a liar. He has lied several times to save his ass. You know this. The question to ask yourself is how much you actually care. Maybe it turns out that you’re actually OK with an open arrangement and that you’re willing to forgive the cheating and lying that came with it because it was all in the service of some frivolous sex. I’d warn you against coming to that conclusion because of the level of comfort in lying that your partner has shown and his willingness to manipulate your grasp on reality for his own gain. But most relationships require their participants to determine their threshold for putting up with shit, and yours just might be particularly high. Ultimately, you have to do you.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbazcl8k000q3b76rq2m9rmf@published"&gt;That said, it would not surprise me at all if, once fully forgiven and accepted, this dude found more opportunities to lie to you. A dynamic has been established, and if your partner has no reason not to lie (in the form of consequences), what’s to stop him from doing it again? This means that even if you eradicate the very concept of cheating from your relationship by opening it up (and I don’t even think you want to do this, I’m just providing you a scenario in which this relationship might continue to function), you may still find yourself a victim of the worst aspect of cheating: the deception.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="31" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbazclb5000r3b76bvql63em@published"&gt;So, I wouldn’t believe anything he says, either, and I’m pretty sure that you don’t—you’re just looking for someone to confirm that you shouldn’t. So here you go. Confirmation is yours.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="91" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbazcldr000s3b76yd3zehm8@published"&gt;Additionally, what’s known as arousal nonconcordance—that is, a disparity in physiological response and the mental erotic experience—is a documented phenomenon (Emily Nagoski bases much of her argument in &lt;em&gt;Come As You Are&lt;/em&gt; on the findings of a study that documented such nonconcordance). As a result, people who feel turned on may not have erections or vaginal wetness, and those who aren’t turned on may nonetheless be erect/wet. It’s quite common. So that part of your partner’s story is possible, theoretically. Practically speaking? I don’t buy any of it. Return to sender.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="88" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbazdpqr001y3b76y1mrzu3b@published"&gt;My wife and I have been together for about three years, dating included. We both love each other very much, are very happy together, and we both feel we’re the best for each other, and also highly compatible. Except, for me, in one matter: Prior to her, I loved going down on my partners. I had never had problems with their smell or the taste. However, with my wife, even when we were dating, I just couldn’t go down on her because of her smell and the taste.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbazhl29006y3b76jnth12ar@published"&gt;We’ve both been tested by our PCPs and we’re both free of all STIs. I thought it could be bacterial vaginosis or a yeast infection, but I’m not sure if you can have either for this long. Her OB-GYN doesn’t seem to think anything is wrong. I told my wife that when I go down on her, my throat itches, and when she mentioned this to her OB-GYN, she seemed to think it “could” be BV and prescribed her something without doing any tests, so I’m not sure if the OB-GYN is any good.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="118" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbazhns600743b76dzp1wjum@published"&gt;The prescription didn’t help either, and I’m not sure if my throat itching was psychological or real. Also, my penis rarely ever smelled before, but I’ve started noticing the smell after I’ve been with her. We don’t use condoms, but she has an IUD. Even prior to her getting an IUD, she had the same smell and taste, so I don’t think it’s that. She only showers on every second or third day, and she points to the plethora of articles online that say that it’s not necessary to take daily showers. I was taught to shower every day. However, even on days she showers, I still can’t stand the smell, so I’m not sure if it’s that.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="110" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbazhemu006s3b767r0r6roi@published"&gt;Since I stopped going down on her, which was over a year ago, she’s stopped going down on me, and I miss that. Other than this, we’re both pretty vanilla, but we have a good sex life, though I can still smell it during sex and it still smells bad to me. I haven’t discussed the smell with my wife for fear of hurting her feelings, and I don’t really know how to bring it up. I used to love going down on my partner, and I really want to get back to it. Is there anything that I can do about the smell, or is this a lost cause?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="68" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbazdve5002g3b76d2ezh2ov@published"&gt;Bacterial vaginosis and yeast infections both have to do with an imbalance in the vaginal microsystem. I’ve never heard of either infection lasting for multiple years—it may be possible, though usually the discomfort encourages people to get treated—but there are loads of cases where the infection is recurring, which can feel the same. I don’t like that the gynecologist didn’t run any tests—that’s definitely worth a second opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="60" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbazdwy9002m3b76qo48i86r@published"&gt;I agree that the IUD and two-to-three day shower schedule don’t seem to be the culprit here. It’s absolutely possible that you simply don’t like the smell of your wife’s genitals and secretions, and that the itchy throat you were experiencing was, in fact, psychological. It’s also possible that there’s something going on with her body that should be treated.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="73" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbazdyl7002s3b76665nfjr0@published"&gt;So how are you going to get your wife to see a doctor for a second opinion? You’re going to have to talk about it. Either way, there’s risk that her feelings will be hurt—you might hurt them by bringing this up now, and you might hurt them by keeping quiet until it eventually comes out. You might have already hurt them by ceasing your oral ministrations and leaving her guessing about why.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="48" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbaze08r002y3b76wchjql7s@published"&gt;Here’s sample language you could try: “Can we talk about something difficult? I’m afraid I’m going to hurt your feelings, but I want to troubleshoot our sex life and get back to giving oral. I’m struggling to do that because I’m turned off by the way you smell.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="16" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbaze1rv00343b760z4eezn0@published"&gt;I know, it’s hard. But if you want something to change, you have to address it.&lt;/p&gt;

Dental dams were literally made for blocking the exchange of fluid. You can get them online or from your local sex-positive shop. They’re sheets of latex or polyurethane that you place over the vulva or anus that you’re about to put your mouth on, which seems really useful in your situation. But—unless you want to leave your wife wondering what’s going on—you need to have the conversation before you pull out the dams.&lt;/p&gt;

He never bothered to please me sexually—no oral sex, he would come in two minutes with no care for me, hated dirty talk or kink of any kind, and made me feel bad for even trying it in the beginning and doing things I had enjoyed with previous partners. Sex dried up a year ago, and the whole situation has been depressing, horrible, and frustrating&lt;/p&gt;

I can’t stand the idea of being anywhere near a man, but I want to have sex with a man again. Will I get over this? Is it even possible after such a horrible experience? Is this normal?&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="93" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbazegdz00443b76bgl7hxol@published"&gt;Also, I have not dated for a million years and the idea of bars, Tinder, etc. sounds terrifying. I fortunately possess nice skin, hair, and a good figure because I have used exercise to deal with my stress over the years, so I am pretty sure I could attract someone, but I can’t bear the idea of even trying with a new person. Can you give me some advice? Is there a way to find a kind, normal and fun male friend with benefits without having to comb bars? I have no idea.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="20" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbazelzd004m3b76dakyz2bo@published"&gt;Oh boy. I am so sorry you lived through that relationship. Looking forward, I must say the prospects are mixed.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="47" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbazenbn004s3b766o4pnc30@published"&gt;Given your revulsion at the idea of dating or having sex right now, it’s clear you need some time. You are recovering from a terrible relationship. Listen to yourself about when you’re ready for dating, much less sex; talk to a therapist if your feelings don’t improve.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  


  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbazeppo004y3b76untxk3pq@published"&gt;For when you are ready, you’re not wrong: Bars, and dating apps, and dating friends of friends are all terrifying for different reasons. Bars because, well, who can get a read on a person with alcohol altering their perception? Dating apps can feel like a slog, and you’re meeting absolute strangers, so there are safety concerns. And friends of friends, there’s the pressure of rejecting someone a friend set you up with.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="72" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbazere300543b76520nj922@published"&gt;If you do end up deciding to go the app route, you can screenshot dates’ profiles and send that along with the information about where you’re meeting to a friend. You can also ask that friend to check in if they haven’t heard from you by a certain time. There’s an upside to apps—you can remain fairly anonymous while you’re text chatting and meet up without even giving dates your phone number.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="34" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbazesxs005a3b76gkpjc470@published"&gt;Dating friends of friends can be complicated, but at least you’ll have some intel ahead of time. Think about who you’re taking dates from—are they likely to get upset if things don’t work out?&lt;/p&gt;


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="99" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbazeuhd005g3b76nti9mgw9@published"&gt;There’s another option, and it may be better for you while you recover from your previous relationship: Get out in the world and meet men the old-fashioned way. Start volunteering for a cause you believe in. Take a class in something gender neutral that you find interesting. Take up journaling or catching up on the news from a coffee shop. Whatever gets you out of the house around other adult humans without alcohol being the main activity. You’re basically engineering chances to meet people, and hoping that eventually you meet someone attractive. Or someone with friends you find attractive.&lt;/p&gt;

If what you want is zero-strings, middle-of-the-night booty calls, make that obvious. If what you want is texting a couple of times a week and having regular sex on Friday nights after dinner, make that obvious, too. Take some time now to figure out exactly what you’re hoping for. It’s no rush.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="108" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cmbazclm6000w3b76iabohs83@published"&gt;Last night, I went on a date with someone who I had met somewhat spontaneously a week or so ago. We were having a really great time—natural conversation, very similar interests, just a good vibe. I don’t normally click with people this easily, and I was so glad our connection didn’t start on an app, so I followed the mood a little more than I might have otherwise and went back to his place. We slept together, and it lived up to the rest of the night. But in the afterglow, he casually let it drop that he’s dating someone seriously, but they’re open. &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/08/first-date-sleeping-together-sex-advice.html"&gt;I felt extremely betrayed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The combined therapy of estrogen plus progestogen has been linked to &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2818206" target="_blank"&gt;a small increased risk&lt;/a&gt; of breast cancer, heart disease, stroke and blood clots, but it is considered safe for those without any contraindications who start taking them before 60 to treat hot flashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="BLBAWLPQCJBCJPFKTFFAFVOIOI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Because hormone therapy&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;may cause estrogen-sensitive cancers to grow, it is not an option for many people with a history of these cancers or who are at high risk of developing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="RD5GKVLKJ5FERISM66VZKZAHUQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;At 38, Jennifer Phillips began battling hot flashes and night sweats after starting chemotherapy for Stage 2b triple-negative breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text grid-center grid-body" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X6GGJLL5CVCNPPA5Q5RKRUVUYE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“Veozah stopped the hot flashes the first night,” said Phillips, now 41, of Pensacola, Florida.

In recovery from her eating disorder, Jones had begun asking not to be weighed at doctor’s appointments. She soon realized not everyone knew that was an option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting health care providers on board with the cards has been great ― 200 providers have ordered anywhere from 100 to 500 cards for their offices, Jones said ― but the responses she’s received from individuals has been the most heartening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The best feedback I hear from patients is, ‘I made my first appointment in years!’” Jones said. “I’m shocked to hear personally from so many people who are delaying health care because they hate stepping on the scale. I love that these cards give them the confidence to walk back into a health care provider’s office.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“Under no circumstances can I know my weight. If it’s more than I expect, I amp up my eating disorder behaviors.

If it’s less, it becomes a weird game where I decide to see how much lower I can go.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walters hasn’t weighed himself in more than 10 years. When he spent six weeks in the hospital in 2019 for eating disorder treatment, they did blind weigh-ins around 6 a.m. every Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We always stood on the scale, facing away from it, which as a method of weighing me was affirming,” he said. “It told me the doctors and staff understood how traumatizing a number related to one’s weight can be.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before that, he would just close his eyes when stepping on a scale at a doctor’s office and say emphatically&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;“&lt;em&gt;I don’t want to know&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, Walters’ family doctor has learned about his triggers, but he knows how hard it can be to speak up for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It can be challenging for &lt;em&gt;anyone&lt;/em&gt; to talk with doctors,” he said. “Their time can feel limited. As a patient you can feel intimidated due to a perceived imbalance in terms of education and knowledge.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;The card “allows a patient to quickly get a message across without having to stumble and bumble through an extremely uncomfortable conversation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, it wouldn’t be such an uncomfortable conversation. Asking not to be weighed should be as simple as stating, “I’d prefer not to be weighed today.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it’s not always that easy, according to Gaudiani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you say you don’t want to be weighed and are challenged, Gaudiani said to tell the nurse, “Thanks for letting me know it’s standard, but this is my body, and I’m electing not to be weighed. You may write ‘declined’ on my note for insurance purposes. I’m happy to discuss it further with my doctor.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the doctor challenges you, bring up the medical issue that brought you into their office in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“That might sound like, ‘I have a short amount of time with you, and I really need to discuss my back pain, my constipation and my asthma today. Let’s focus on that, please,’” Gaudiani said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the cards could also help combat pervasive fatphobia in the medical community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since going viral, the cards have received some criticism from people online who think the cards are enabling or will do damage to public health given the &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/articles/2019-09-19/obesity-in-america-a-guide-to-the-public-health-crisis" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="obesity epidemic" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6838860be4b06202aa916e0d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/articles/2019-09-19/obesity-in-america-a-guide-to-the-public-health-crisis" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="8"&gt;obesity epidemic&lt;/a&gt; in America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/thenutritiontea/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Shana Spence" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6838860be4b06202aa916e0d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.instagram.com/thenutritiontea/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="9"&gt;Shana Spence&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist based in New York, said she thinks weight stigma and a &lt;a href="https://www.self.com/story/weight-bias-and-health-care" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="larger trend of fatphobia in the medical field" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6838860be4b06202aa916e0d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.self.com/story/weight-bias-and-health-care" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="10"&gt;larger trend of fatphobia in the medical field&lt;/a&gt; does greater damage to the quality of health care and health outcomes than any card could ever do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Fatphobia in the medical field often translates into &lt;a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/how-fat-phobia-impacts-patients-and-doctors" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="a lack of diagnosing" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="6838860be4b06202aa916e0d" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/how-fat-phobia-impacts-patients-and-doctors" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;a lack of diagnosing&lt;/a&gt; for ailments,” she said. “When someone goes in for pain or whatever ailment, it’s extremely discouraging to be told to just lose weight or simply ignored altogether.

              &lt;p&gt;When cardiologist Eric Topol goes to the grocery store these days, his cart stands out among the crowd. It's no longer filled with boxes or packaged goods, he says it's largely just &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/simple-longevity-tricks-to-improve-diet-routine-2025-2" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;fresh produce&lt;/a&gt; — a big change from what he used to buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was reading a lot of labels, and now I avoid things with labels," Topol told Business Insider. "When I'm in the grocery store and I'm only buying produce, people look at me like, 'what's wrong with this guy?'"&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It all happened about a year ago, as he was deep into research for his new bestselling &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Super-Agers/Eric-Topol/9781668067666" data-track-click='{"click_type":"other","element_name":"body_link","event":"outbound_click"}' rel=" nofollow"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; "Super Agers: An evidence-based approach to longevity." That's when he overhauled his relationship with packaged and mass-produced foods, cracking down on any &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/scientists-making-ultra-processed-foods-healthier-in-major-new-study-2024-6" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;ultra-processed food&lt;/a&gt; (UPF).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I call 'em UFOs," Topol said. "A lot of those things I didn't realize were so full of bad things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="7c7432c1-81f1-4fe9-9b0e-a3546ce2734d" data-toc-id="7c7432c1-81f1-4fe9-9b0e-a3546ce2734d"&gt;A key reason ultra-processed foods are bad: they're anti-fiber&lt;/h2&gt;

                      Ultra-processed foods tend to lack fiber, which is naturally abundant in fresh fare like vegetables and beans.

              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Topol shops now using the common nutritional rule-of-thumb to stick to the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/photos-blue-zone-grocery-store-healthy-eating-easy-and-cheap-2023-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;perimeter of the grocery store&lt;/a&gt;, the area where the fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, bulk grains, and frozen veggies are stored. It's those middle aisles full of ultra-processed products that he generally avoids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Topol explains in his new book, ultra-processed foods are "the polar opposite" of &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-spector-increase-fiber-plant-based-protein-sources-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;fiber&lt;/a&gt;, a key nutrient abundant in fresh foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/healthy-blue-zone-vegan-chicken-salad-recipe-2023-10" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;beans&lt;/a&gt;, and grains, which we know is great for our long-term health in all different kinds of ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;fiber slows down and aids digestion, improves cholesterol, fosters the health of the gut microbiome, and even helps stabilize blood sugar. UPFs generally don't.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What is referred to as the 'Western diet,' rich in &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/why-processed-foods-are-bad-digested-quickly-ultramarthon-runners-2019-8" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;ultra-processed foods, is pro-inflammatory&lt;/a&gt; and linked with metabolic dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-environmental-causes-microplastics-antibiotics-sleep-2025-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;colon cancer&lt;/a&gt;," Topol's book says. His diet wasn't wildly unhealthy before, but he's become a more rigorous shopper as a result of his latest research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it's packaged or boxed or canned, I know it's probably gonna be a problem," Topol said. "I'll check it out. Sometimes, you can be surprised."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="6c236436-ab90-427c-bc02-e76e091d63af" data-toc-id="6c236436-ab90-427c-bc02-e76e091d63af"&gt;Not all packaged foods are created equal&lt;/h2&gt;

Among these, Aspergillus—a common yet potentially deadly fungus—is gaining new ground. Once confined primarily to warmer regions, this airborne threat is now forecasted to expand its reach into parts of North America, Europe, China, and Russia. A recent study by researchers at the University of Manchester employed advanced climate modeling to predict how Aspergillus will migrate in response to rising temperatures, warning that millions more people may be at risk of infection by 2100. The shifting climate acts as a gateway for fungi like Aspergillus to reach immunocompromised populations. Regions once considered safe may soon become new fungal hotspots&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Aspergillus is a familiar organism to scientists and farmers, its ability to cause invasive aspergillosis—a severe lung infection—makes it a serious public health concern. The new findings arrive amid a global rise in fungal infections, which already claim an estimated 2.5 million lives annually. These numbers may be underreported due to the difficulty in diagnosis and the limited global surveillance of fungal diseases. The stealthy rise of fungal diseases highlights gaps in our healthcare systems. Without early detection and treatment, fungal infections may rival bacterial pandemics in severity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article explores the science behind Aspergillus, the impact of climate change on its distribution, and the urgent need for enhanced monitoring and medical preparedness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="11"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Aspergillus? Understanding the fungus among us&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspergillus is a genus of over 300 mold species that thrive in various environments—soil, plant matter, decaying leaves, compost, and even indoor dust. Although many species are harmless and some are even useful in industrial fermentation (like soy sauce or citric acid production), several are pathogenic to humans and animals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the most concerning are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aspergillus fumigatus&lt;/strong&gt;: The most common cause of aspergillosis, particularly dangerous for immunocompromised individuals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aspergillus flavus&lt;/strong&gt;: Known for producing aflatoxins, potent carcinogens that contaminate crops like maize and peanuts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aspergillus niger&lt;/strong&gt;: Common in indoor environments and capable of causing ear infections and respiratory issues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;These fungi reproduce by releasing microscopic spores (conidia) into the air. While healthy individuals can inhale these spores with little consequence, vulnerable populations—including those with asthma, COPD, cancer, organ transplants, or HIV—face a much higher risk of serious complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="22"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Aspergillosis explained: The deadly lung infection you’ve probably never heard of&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aspergillosis refers to a group of diseases caused by Aspergillus spores that take root in the lungs and sometimes spread to other parts of the body. The most severe form, invasive aspergillosis, can be fatal if not treated promptly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Types of Aspergillosis:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA)&lt;/strong&gt;: A hypersensitive reaction often seen in asthma or cystic fibrosis patients.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA)&lt;/strong&gt;: Long-term infection leading to lung cavities and respiratory decline.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invasive aspergillosis&lt;/strong&gt;: A fast-spreading, often deadly condition in immunocompromised individuals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Symptoms include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persistent cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shortness of breath&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fever&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chest pain&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hemoptysis (coughing up blood)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="35"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes aspergillosis particularly dangerous is the difficulty in diagnosis. Its symptoms often mimic other respiratory illnesses, delaying appropriate treatment. Moreover, treatment options are limited, with only four primary classes of antifungal drugs available—azole resistance among Aspergillus species is growing, making infections harder to treat. According to the researchers, this resistance has evolved because of the widespread agricultural use of azole fungicides. Azole drugs that work in a similar way are the first-line treatment for patients infected with the Aspergillus fumigatus mould, so the fungus’ exposure to azole fungicides in the environment means it is often in a drug-resistant form even before it even encounters the people it infects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="41"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How climate change is driving the spread of Aspergillus&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The University of Manchester study underscores a chilling reality: as global temperatures climb, so does the habitat range of heat-tolerant fungi. Using a combination of climate simulation models and fungal biology data, researchers evaluated how Aspergillus species will respond to two climate scenarios—moderate emissions and high fossil fuel use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="46"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Key findings:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="48"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aspergillus flavus, a heat-loving fungus, is projected to expand its global range by 16% under high-emission scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Aspergillus fumigatus, traditionally found in temperate regions, may shift its range northward, with a 77.5% increase in its potential habitat by 2100.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This expansion could put 9 million more people in Europe at increased risk.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cooler regions such as northern China, Russia, and parts of Canada could soon become hotspots for fungal colonization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conversely, sub-Saharan Africa, already experiencing extreme temperatures, might become too hot for certain Aspergillus strains, leading to unexpected shifts in ecological balance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="50"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why heat makes fungi stronger&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fungi generally struggle to thrive at the high internal temperatures of mammals. However, as average global temperatures rise, fungi are slowly adapting to heat stress, and moulding themselves. This means they are more likely to survive—and flourish—inside the human body. This heat-hardening process could lead to the emergence of new, more virulent fungal strains capable of overcoming our natural defenses. Species like &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Candida auris&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; have already demonstrated an alarming capacity to resist antifungal treatments. The narrowing thermal gap between fungi and humans may create unforeseen public health risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to temperature changes, climate-linked weather events like hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods play a critical role in dispersing fungal spores. The 2011 tornado in Joplin, Missouri, for example, led to a rare and deadly fungal outbreak. As these extreme weather events become more frequent, the spread of Aspergillus spores across long distances will likely increase, enhancing their potential to infect new populations. Flooded buildings and debris provide fertile breeding grounds for fungal colonies. Weakened infrastructure and displaced communities further amplify vulnerability to infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="65"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Public health implications: Who is at risk?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="66"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Populations most vulnerable to the threat of Aspergillus expansion include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="68"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="69"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Immunocompromised individuals (e.g., cancer, HIV, or transplant patients)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Elderly populations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with respiratory conditions such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, or COPD&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rural populations with increased exposure to airborne spores from agriculture&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="70"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;In regions projected to become new habitats for Aspergillus, public health systems may not be adequately prepared to diagnose or treat fungal diseases. There’s an urgent need for greater awareness, improved diagnostic tools, and antifungal research funding to meet this looming threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="74"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="75"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Medical challenges: Drug resistance and diagnostic gaps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="76"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most alarming aspects of the fungal threat is growing antifungal resistance. Azoles, the most commonly used antifungal drugs, are becoming less effective due to overuse in both medicine and agriculture. Some Aspergillus strains now exhibit multi-drug resistance, rendering current treatments ineffective and complicating recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="79"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further compounding the crisis is the lack of rapid diagnostic tests. In many healthcare settings, fungal infections are misdiagnosed or only detected at advanced stages. Unlike bacteria or viruses, fungal pathogens are harder to culture and require specialized labs to identify accurately.

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who are at higher risk for heart disease also seem more likely to develop dementia. And research led by The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio) has discovered new associations between various lipid, or fat, levels in the blood and the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, the most common cause of dementia worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The findings mean that using blood lipid profiles could help better understand, predict and possibly even prevent the disease in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In more than 800 &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/older+adults/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;older adults&lt;/a&gt; who were part of the long-running Framingham Heart Study, the researchers found that higher levels of small dense cholesterol particles—which are known to increase the risk of atherosclerosis and &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/coronary+heart+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;coronary heart disease&lt;/a&gt;—were associated with higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, higher levels of a marker for small fat-carrying particles, which are involved in the transport of dietary fats from the gut to other body tissues through the blood after eating, were associated with lower risk of developing the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps ironically, the researchers also discovered that individuals who had the lowest levels of highly dense cholesterol particles—often referred to as "good cholesterol" as it is considered protective against cardiovascular disease—had a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease compared to the rest of the included individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings highlight the complex relationships of blood lipids with both heart and brain health, suggesting the possibility of certain blood lipids playing different roles in cardiovascular disease and dementia-related biological processes," said Sokratis Charisis, MD, a researcher with the Glenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer's and Neurodegenerative Diseases at UT Health San Antonio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charisis is first author of the study published May 30 in the journal &lt;i&gt;Neurology&lt;/i&gt;, titled, "Association of Blood Lipoprotein Levels With Incident Alzheimer's Disease in Community-Dwelling Individuals: The Framingham Heart Study." Other authors include corresponding author Sudha Seshadri, MD, director of the Biggs Institute, and researchers from Boston University School of Public Health, the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley and the Framingham Heart Study.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;h2&gt;A community-based analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new study notes that dementia is a leading source of morbidity and mortality in the aging population. Worldwide, there were 57.4 million people living with dementia in 2019, a number that is expected to reach 152.8 million by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is a general trend over time of decreasing the incidence of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias in the U.S. and other higher-income countries that is at least partially attributed to better management of cardiovascular risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Framingham Heart Study is an ongoing, community-based cohort study that was launched in 1948 in Framingham, Massachusetts. Residents there aged 30 to 59 were randomly selected from census data to participate. Those with definite signs of cardiovascular disease at baseline were excluded. Participants of the original cohort have undergone up to 32 examinations performed every two years, which have included detailed history-taking by a physician, a physical examination and lab testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest analysis by researchers led by UT Health San Antonio included participants from the original cohort who were 60 years or older and free of dementia during an examination period of 1985-1988, and had available cognitive follow-up and lipoprotein marker data. Lipoproteins act as a transport system for lipids in the bloodstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Blood lipid levels and dementia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), or good cholesterol; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), or "bad cholesterol"; small dense LDL-C (sdLDL-C); and other lipoprotein types associated with heart disease were measured in blood samples obtained from the mid- to late-'80s examination period. The Framingham participants were watched for incident Alzheimer's disease, meaning a first diagnosis of the disease, until 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Of a total of 822 participants, 128 developed incident Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that an increase of 1 standard deviation unit (SDU) of a concentration of small dense LDL-C (sdLDL-C), a value representing how far a specific data point deviates from the mean, was associated with a 21% increase in the risk for incident Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the name implies, small dense LDL-C (sdLDL-C) is a type of the so-called bad cholesterol with smaller and denser particles than other low-density lipoproteins, and that is considered more likely to form plaque in arteries, strongly associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cardiovascular+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cardiovascular disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1 SDU increase in a concentration of ApoB48, a lipoprotein that transports dietary fat from the intestines and into the bloodstream that also is tied to &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/heart+disease/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt; and cardiovascular problems, was found to be associated with a 22% decrease in the risk for incident Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants in the first quartile of HDL-C, or good cholesterol—in order of lesser amounts—were 44% less likely to develop Alzheimer's compared with those in the second, third and fourth quartiles. And those with small dense LDL-C concentrations below the median were 38% less likely to develop Alzheimer's compared with those with concentrations above the median.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, then, lower small-density bad cholesterol (sdLDL-C) concentrations and higher ApoB48 concentrations were associated with a lower Alzheimer's risk. And individuals with the lowest good &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/cholesterol/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; (HDL-C) concentrations were less likely to develop Alzheimer's compared with the remaining sample.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"These findings underscore links between lipoprotein metabolism pathways and Alzheimer's risk, emphasizing the potential role of blood lipoprotein markers in Alzheimer's risk stratification and of lipid modification strategies in dementia prevention," the researchers concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

"It is commonly found in products like cigarettes, cigars, and chewing tobacco."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to dietician Benson, tobacco is prepared for chewing or smoking by drying the leaves of the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-R2aZ9vHgP4Hqs22Ukx5mN6" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-R2aZ9vHgP4Hqs22Ukx5mN6 slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-does-tobacco-affect-your-sleep-and-why-3"&gt;How does tobacco affect your sleep and why?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tobacco's negative effect on sleep all stems from the highly addictive nicotine within the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tobacco can cause sleep issues, especially when used within four to five hours of bedtime," explains Benson. "That’s because nicotine is a stimulant—it increases alertness and can make it harder to fall asleep or stay asleep through the night."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Hill, the stimulant can increase heart rate and delay the onset of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/rem-sleep" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/rem-sleep"&gt;REM sleep&lt;/a&gt;. "As the nicotine wears off over the course of the night, it can cause a withdrawal effect that may lead to lighter sleep and frequent awakenings," she warns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="which-form-of-tobacco-use-is-worse-for-sleep-3"&gt;Which form of tobacco use is worse for sleep?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;While both smoking and chewing tobacco can make it harder to fall asleep, which is actually worse for your sleep health?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Hill and Benson agree that smoking is by far the worst form of tobacco use for sleep, even though other forms such as chewing and vaping also greatly disrupt sleep, due to the respiratory issues it causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Smoking is typically the worst for sleep," Benson tells us. "Not just because of the nicotine, but also because it affects your breathing and may increase the risk of sleep disorders, like &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep-problems/sleep-apnea" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep-problems/sleep-apnea"&gt;sleep apnea&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hill also points out that smokers feel the stimulating effect of nicotine differently to other tobacco users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Smoking tobacco delivers nicotine to the bloodstream at a faster rate than chewing tobacco, leading to a quicker stimulant effect," she says. "Those who smoke also tend to be more at risk for &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/insomnia-what-is-it-whats-the-cause-and-how-to-tackle-it" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/features/insomnia-what-is-it-whats-the-cause-and-how-to-tackle-it"&gt;insomnia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/how-to-stop-restless-legs-immediately-for-a-good-nights-sleep-according-to-doctors" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/how-to-stop-restless-legs-immediately-for-a-good-nights-sleep-according-to-doctors"&gt;restless leg syndrome&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-happens-to-your-sleep-after-quitting-tobacco-3"&gt;What happens to your sleep after quitting tobacco?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check&gt;&lt;figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"&gt;&lt;span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that ditching tobacco and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/how-quitting-smoking-can-benefit-your-sleep" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/how-quitting-smoking-can-benefit-your-sleep"&gt;quitting smoking can greatly improve your sleep&lt;/a&gt;, but the bad news is that it takes time to feel the benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It’s possible for sleep to worsen the first few weeks after quitting tobacco due to nicotine withdrawals," warns Hill. "Some symptoms experienced may include insomnia, &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/how-to-prevent-night-sweats" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/how-to-prevent-night-sweats"&gt;night sweats&lt;/a&gt;, and vivid dreams."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Hill emphasises that after this period, sleep quality improves. "People who quit smoking tend to experience the benefits of falling asleep faster, having more &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/deep-sleep" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/sleep/deep-sleep"&gt;deep sleep&lt;/a&gt; and longer sleep durations, and fewer awakenings," the health expert says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benson agrees, telling us how long you'll typically need to wait to see improvement. "It usually gets better within 3 to 4 weeks," reassures the nutrition advisor. "But talk to your healthcare provider if your sleep doesn’t start to improve."&lt;/p&gt;
