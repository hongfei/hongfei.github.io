I am bipolar, and I moved to the Netherlands to legally end my life. I’m not special, I’m just ready.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/okuntakinte/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Awuah-Darko&lt;/a&gt;, a 28-year-old British-Ghanaian artist, has documented his battle with &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/11/30/what-is-bipolar-disorder/71636701007/#:~:text=That's%20about%2011.3%20million%20people,day%2Dto%2Dday%20activities." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;treatment-resistant bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt; for years. After contemplating &lt;a href="/story/news/nation/2025/03/31/terri-schiavo-death-after-20-years/82696234007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;assisted dying&lt;/a&gt; for five years, he is now pursuing the treatment under the public eye on grounds of mental suffering. In the Netherlands, &lt;a href="https://www.government.nl/topics/euthanasia" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;assisted euthanasia for psychiatric conditions is legal&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with a lengthy approval process. His announcement has been met with mixed reactions — curiosity, horror, sympathy, prayers, confessions of shared struggles and even pleas to change his mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“What usually happens when you cry on the internet is that people bully you and create memes from your ugly crying,” he says from Amsterdam, over the phone in late March. “To my shock and a bit of my bemusement, that didn't happen to me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Amid accusations of “&lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2024/07/30/suicide-prevention-dad-story-website-teen-phone/74507915007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;romanticizing suicide&lt;/a&gt;,” the most shocking response was not the criticism or praise — but a dinner invitation. Hundreds of strangers invited Awuah-Darko to share a meal, inspiring him to start a worldwide tour of dinners with strangers, which he has coined the "Last Supper Project." As he awaits a decision on his request for euthanasia, he’s had 93 dinners and received over 4,000 invitations. He's traveled to Paris, Milan, Brussels and Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Dinner is a very, if not the most, intimate and intentional part of anyone's day," he says. "For me, that has just been a special way of fostering remarkable relationships and connections during the time I have left."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;One of his most impactful dinners was with a Surinamese mother who struggled with suicidal ideation and postpartum depression. She invited her kids to the table for a guided discussion over homemade Surinamese sourdough soup. At his 30th dinner, he met his friend Emmanual, who suffers from C-PTSD and has been scheduled to die on July 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Awuah-Darko, who has attempted suicide in the past, calls himself “just one person among millions” struggling with bipolar disorder and chronic suicidality — but he understands the power of social media to amplify a story. “If people choose to see it as romanticizing, I think that more reflects on them,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But under the watchful eyes of over 560,000 Instagram followers, Awuah-Darko undoubtedly has an impact. Whether that is “good” or “bad” is still debated, and bioethicists and mental health experts say the answer may lie in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/12/USAT/83059483007-img-5052.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=516&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/12/USAT/83059483007-img-5052.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;height=1032&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Awuah-Darko has had 93 dinners and counting with strangers through the 'Last Supper Project'"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Awuah-Darko has had 93 dinners and counting with strangers through the 'Last Supper Project'" data-c-credit="Joseph Awuah-Darko"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;'People should be able to talk about uncomfortable, inconvenient things'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Assisted dying for psychiatric conditions is a complicated ethical dilemma with many “right” answers, according to bioethicists. While it’s imperative to spark open conversations around mental health and suicide, mental health experts caution that romanticization can ignite contagion suicide (also known as “copycat suicides” or the “Werther effect”). In contrast, the "Papegeno effect" is the effect that mass media can have by presenting positive examples of hope and non-suicide alternatives to crises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“We know from studies that this can be a real risk, but also protective for some,” says Manuel Trachsel, a bio and medical ethics professor at the University of Basel in Switzerland who co-authored a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9306695/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; on assisted dying for severe and persistent mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As for the mixed reactions to Awuah-Darko — including those praying for him to change his mind — some people “predominantly fear the Wether effect, and others see the chance of the Papageno effect,” Trachsel says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nami.org/about-nami/who-we-are/meet-our-leadership/ken-duckworth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Ken Duckworth&lt;/a&gt;, a triple board-certified psychiatrist and the Chief Medical Officer at the National Alliance for Mental Illness (NAMI), affirms that talking about suicide &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24998511/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;will not put the idea into people’s heads&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735818301351" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;improve treatment-seeking behaviors&lt;/a&gt;. But social media, he says, gets complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I can't speak to how much he's suffering, and that is his decision. But making it such a public event does strike me as problematic,” says Duckworth. He worries that people considering suicide may fall susceptible to the contagion effect if they see Awuah-Darko as “cool” or “inspirational."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But Awuah-Darko doesn’t think he’s romanticizing suicide, nor does he want to. Rather, he wants to avoid people not talking about it at all. Still, he knows that bringing attention to assisted suicide doesn’t come without criticism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“My biggest curse, and I guess blessing sometimes, is my awareness of all this, and yet still choosing to do it,” he says. “I think people should be able to talk about uncomfortable, inconvenient things without being accused of romanticizing it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Awuah-Darko is not interested in people who are "more interested in playing offense, politics and collective outrage" than having a nuanced conversation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;He continues, “I think what people inadvertently say when they speak about their discomfort with seeing me talk about the dignity of medically assisted death is that they would rather I not talk about it, which means to continue this dangerously culpable culture of people ending their lives in private and in shame."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/12/USAT/83059485007-img-8583.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=376&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/12/USAT/83059485007-img-8583.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;height=752&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt='In Ghana, Awuah-Darko says food is "spiritual and remarkably therapeutic."'&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption='In Ghana, Awuah-Darko says food is "spiritual and remarkably therapeutic."' data-c-credit="Joseph Awuah-Darko"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;The ethics of assisted dying versus evidence that suicide is preventable&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Trachsel says an autonomy-based ethical argument for assisted suicide for psychiatric conditions is that “every person has the right to determine the time and circumstances of their death” and we should not “discriminate” between those with psychiatric disorders and persons with somatic diseases.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;However, for mood disorders, such as bipolar disorder, suicidal ideation can be a transient state, according to Duckworth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“The mood states are inherently complicated. Helplessness and hopelessness are criteria of depression. Poor judgment and impulsivity are features of mania,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Awauh-Darko, who lives with chronic suicidality, struggles to navigate oscillations between manic productivity and deep lows, like many individuals with bipolar disorder, he says. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at age 16, but doesn't remember a time without its symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"You still essentially fear, or are almost terrified of joy, because you know that a deep depression beckons right around the corner," he says. "You do get fatigued of constantly trying to be okay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.iasp.info/our_team/lars-mehlum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Lars Mehlum&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychiatry and suicidology, believes that chronic suicidality is still treatable and that doctors too often “give up” on patients who are regarded as untreatable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“People who are advocating for euthanasia look at it as some sort of linear process. It's not. It's very transactional and also volatile,” says Mehlum, who is also the founding director of the National Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention at the University of Oslo Institute of Clinical Medicine. He co-authored a &lt;a href="https://bpded.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40479-020-00131-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;2020 study&lt;/a&gt; on assisted suicide for people with personality disorders. “For example, people who are suicidal can very much be deeply suicidal in the moment. But in extreme cases, you can change suicidality within five minutes.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Duckworth’s research also illustrates that suicide is preventable — a rigorously studied belief shared by prominent mental health organizations like &lt;a href="https://988lifeline.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;988 Lifeline&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://988lifeline.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;American Foundation for Suicide Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, according to their mission statements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When working on NAMI’s book, “&lt;a href="https://www.nami.org/support-education/publications-reports/you-are-not-alone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;You Are Not Alone: The NAMI Guide to Navigating Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;,” he interviewed 130 people, many of whom were suicidal in their 20s, but not in their 30s or 40s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“The 20s are a difficult time in general, in life and in mental health conditions,” he explains. Finding companionship and joining peer support groups, along with the development of innovative treatments, were protective factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Mehlum says it can take 20 years for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3241518/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;research evidence to reach clinical practice&lt;/a&gt;. New treatments are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39427446/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;continuously studied&lt;/a&gt;. Prozac, one of the most commonly prescribed antidepressants, was developed in the 1970s, but didn’t become widely available until 1988. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Duckworth argues that Awuah-Darko is pursuing one of his recommended treatments — regardless of intention — through the “Last Supper Project” by building strong social connections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In the United States and Awuah-Darko’s home of London, assisted death for mental health suffering is illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;'Life has surprised me'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Awuah-Darko speaks with poise and intention, but he is self-aware of this juxtaposition. Some may see his apparent put-togetherness as contradictory to his suffering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“While I may sound sanitized, composed and be able to structure sentences on this phone call, it doesn't mean that I'm not masking or that I'm not having to navigate complex emotions,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;He also says he couldn’t care less about being profiled in any capacity, at least not for personal fame. Rather, Awuah-Darko wants his story to reach people, whether through Instagram or this article, who feel alone in their battles, even if that comes with backlash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I have gotten messages and letters, thousands of which have spoken to how liberating people find my ability to speak so openly about what I'm going through,” he says. “And that's worth it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Society extends more grace in hindsight, he says. Instagram comment sections are flooded with hearts and flowers; the media memorializes a tragedy. “But when someone chooses to confront it as a living person, there tends to be vitriol,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;On average, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9251055/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;5% of people&lt;/a&gt; who apply for assisted death for psychiatric conditions in the Netherlands are approved. Between 2012 and 2021, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2828937#:~:text=Findings%20In%20this%20cohort%20study,suicide%20during%20the%20application%20process." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;only 3% of applicants younger than 24&lt;/a&gt; died by assisted suicide on a mental health basis; 47% of applications were retracted and 45% were rejected. In 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.euthanasiecommissie.nl/actueel/nieuws/2025/03/24/tien-procent-meer-meldingen-euthanasie-in-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;219 out of 9,958 euthanasia deaths&lt;/a&gt; were for psychiatric reasons, and the total deaths increased by 10% compared to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I hope I get approved,” Awuah-Darko says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;However, when asked if he will change his mind, his honest answer is, "I don't know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Life has surprised me. I did not expect to be invited to dinner by thousands of people.

While in neurons, excess alpha-synuclein leads to cell death, in melanoma cells it enables uncontrolled growth by recruiting repair proteins to DNA breaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dual role highlights the complex nature of alpha-synuclein and suggests new therapeutic targets for both diseases. Researchers now aim to modulate this protein’s function to either curb cancer growth or restore protective DNA repair in neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Role of Alpha-Synuclein:&lt;/strong&gt; In Parkinson’s, it exits the nucleus and forms harmful clumps; in melanoma, it remains in the nucleus and over-repairs DNA.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancer Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; In melanoma cells, alpha-synuclein boosts the recruitment of repair protein 53BP1, promoting cell survival and proliferation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Drugs that adjust alpha-synuclein function could offer new treatments for both Parkinson’s disease and melanoma.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Oregon Health and Science University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A small protein involved in neurodegeneration leading to Parkinson’s disease also drives a type of skin cancer known as melanoma, new research led by Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University finds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, suggests new avenues for drug development to reduce the risk of developing &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; Parkinson’s and skin cancer by targeting the alpha-synuclein protein, which appears to have a critical role in regulating cellular functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108710"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows DNA." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In melanoma, researchers found that alpha-synuclein does its job too well — allowing cells to proliferate uncontrollably as cancer. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Developing drugs that target alpha-synuclein may be useful in both diseases,” said senior author Vivek Unni, M.D., Ph.D., an associate professor of neurology in the OHSU School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding builds on a previous discovery by Unni and colleagues published in 2019 that found alpha-synuclein helps to perform a critical function by repairing double strand breaks in the DNA of brain cells known as neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They believe this function is crucial in preventing cell death, which occurs when alpha-synuclein exits the cell’s nucleus and instead forms clumps known as Lewy bodies in Parkinson’s and Lewy body dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study, conducted in melanoma cells and led by OHSU M.D./Ph.D. student Moriah Arnold, B.A., Ph.D., finds the opposite effect in respect to melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In melanoma, researchers found that alpha-synuclein does its job too well — allowing cells to proliferate uncontrollably as cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Skin cells are constantly growing and dying and being replaced. That’s normal,” Unni said. “The problem comes when the cells that should be dying don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that alpha-synuclein in melanomas don’t seem to leave the nucleus and aggregate as they do with neurons in Parkinson’s. Instead, the opposite occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They increase in the nucleus and perform their function too well within the nucleolus of each melanoma cell’s nucleus: identifying double strand breaks in DNA and then recruiting a different type of protein, known as &lt;em&gt;53BP1&lt;/em&gt;, to repair them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can lead to runaway cellular replication — cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counterintuitively, Unni said, a similar increase in alpha-synuclein leads to cellular &lt;em&gt;death&lt;/em&gt; in Parkinson’s. Why? In neurons as opposed to skin cells, an overabundance of alpha-synuclein seems to pull them out of the cell’s nucleus into clusters forming in the cytoplasm surrounding the nucleus, Unni said. This, in turn, leads to cellular death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A neuron has to live the whole life of a person,” Unni said. “When alpha-synuclein reaches a tipping point of abundance, it can no longer perform its normal function and the neuron dies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests it may be possible to develop a drug that lowers the level of alpha-synuclein or modulates its function to treat melanoma, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, he said his research is now exploring other avenues to boost the recruitment of the binding protein &lt;em&gt;53BP1&lt;/em&gt; to replace the function of alpha-synuclein as a possible treatment for Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This provides a framework for understanding the link between (Parkinson’s disease) and melanoma, and offers potential therapeutic targets in melanoma that are focused on reducing aSyn-mediated nucleolar double strand break repair,” the authors conclude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Research was supported by the National Institute on Aging, National Institute of Neurological Disorders &amp;amp; Stroke, and National Cancer Center, of the National Institutes of Health, Awards F30AG082406, R01NS102227, P30NS061800 and P30CA065823; the Danish Cancer Society award R302-A17506; the Melanoma Research Alliance, the Michael J.

We now show that αSyn is preferentially enriched within the nucleolus in melanoma, where it colocalizes with DNA damage markers and DSBs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inducing DSBs specifically within nucleolar ribosomal DNA (rDNA) increases αSyn levels near sites of damage. αSyn knockout increases DNA damage within the nucleolus at baseline, after specific rDNA DSB induction, and prolongs the rate of recovery from this induced damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;αSyn is important downstream of ataxia-telangiectasia–mutated signaling to facilitate MDC1-mediated 53BP1 recruitment to DSBs, reducing micronuclei formation and promoting cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 12:25:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTFA2S1lJZjRham9rdER2ckRvbUZiODFDNGxrWTNZTkhCUDFjN3hiRWZXNHF5YlZFVlREaC1DZ0ZDQmgxaGNOWnA4aG9OSGFxOXR0ejFkbEtQeGFsYmI2cS03UTFmTzlySWtESWc</guid></item><item><title>被绝望困扰： 12名赞比亚人在艾滋病毒药物耗尽时分享他们的故事：山羊和苏打水- NPR | Haunted by hopelessness: 12 Zambians share their stories as HIV drugs run out : Goats and Soda - NPR</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxNLXByN2RaZmU2aHhVUG1yVnhSWDhicndMdFpQd09mVW9VeHFnZDRUOWJOakcwUnc3VmVpMTd2cFF4V2l2X1hCbmw1RFBXclVZc1BrYkNlWTdsZXBqVE5PVHptSktSWUEyaDA1cGQ0NVBpYl9OTUdnSzlQUF9CZjR4WHo2akZSXy1zX293Z3BPY0V6QVlObE9KUQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="storytext" class="storytext storylocation linkLocation"&gt;

                Reverend Billiance Chondwe of the Somone Community Center, a branch of the Pentecostal Holiness Church in Zambia, says that many in his congregation have fallen ill since late January when cuts to U.S. aid shuttered clinics.  "We are close to 300 [worshipers] but nowadays we are only less than 150. People are sick at home."

   &lt;p&gt;From the pulpit, Reverend Billiance Chondwe counts the empty seats.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We are close to 300 [worshipers] but nowadays we are only less than 150. People are sick at home," says Chondwe — or Pastor Billy as everyone calls him — as he greeted congregants on a Sunday in early April at the entrance to his church, the Somone Community Center, a branch of the Pentecostal Holiness Church in Zambia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People are falling ill because the U.S.-funded clinics where they got their HIV medications and care have suddenly been shuttered. The staff is gone. The electricity has been shut off. Some patients have already run out of their daily pills that keep HIV at bay — and they have started to feel the physical consequences of the virus surging back.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The Trump Administration, in January, abruptly halted the vast majority of U.S. foreign assistance in light of their America First agenda. Officials said that &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/emergency-humanitarian-waiver-to-foreign-assistance-pause/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lifesaving aid&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — such as HIV medications — would continue to flow. But the reality on the ground shows otherwise. An untold number of people with HIV have simply and suddenly lost access to their medication.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-60044" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                A shuttered USAID clinic in Kitwe, Zambia. The clinic provided free HIV medications and treatment to the community until it was suddenly closed in late January. People still show up at the clinic for their medicine only to find the lights out and the staff no longer there.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;That is largely because the halting of foreign assistance and cancelling of programs crippled the systems that enabled people to get their AIDS medicines. And, of the small number of programs that are technically allowed to continue, many report not being paid by the U.S. government and, thus, having to close their doors and lay off workers.  The State Department, which oversees foreign assistance, did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2024, Zambia received &lt;a href="https://foreignassistance.gov/cd/zambia/2024/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$240 million&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the U.S. to support HIV/AIDS work, including prevention, treatment and distribution of medications. NPR visited and spoke to many in this southern African nation who have expressed great frustration that the cuts to aid came with no warning and no transition plan. But they also acknowledged that their country had become dependent on foreign aid and that the government needs to do more to fill the vast gaps left by the sudden U.S. withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"The main victim that is paying the price of this disruptive decision to cut the U.S. aid funding is the ordinary Zambian person living in poverty," says &lt;a href="https://uni-osnabrueck.academia.edu/ChrisZimba" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Zumani Zimba&lt;/a&gt;, a Zambian political scientist affiliated with the University of Central Africa. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/zambia/overview" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;World Bank&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, more than 60% of the population there lives in poverty. And, &lt;a href="https://zm.usembassy.gov/zambia-surpasses-unaids-hiv-treatment-and-viral-suppression-targets-and-on-track-to-surpass-hiv-status-awareness/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;more than 10%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of adults in the country have HIV — half the rate of a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A study out this month in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)00401-5/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Lancet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; estimated what would happen if the U.S. does not continue its flagship HIV/AIDS program that's been pivotal to reversing the downward trend in life expectancy due to AIDS. The researchers from Oxford University and elsewhere found that half a million additional children will die of AIDS in the next 5 years in sub-Saharan Africa and nearly 3 million more African children will be orphaned by AIDS. In many Zambian communities, people say these numbers will soon be more than just a forecast.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mothers and children, husbands and wives, doctors, truck drivers and religious leaders are all grappling with the fallout of the U.S. cutting aid. Here are stories of those impacted in just one part of one country: Zambia's resource-rich Copperbelt Province.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59786" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

When Dorcas would get home from school, she'd often play house, pretending to prepare nshima — a thick traditional porridge — for her imaginary family. "I'm thinking she'll be very family-oriented when she grows up," says Theresa in Bemba, a local language spoken in parts of Zambia. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's now been eight days since both Dorcas and her mom, Theresa, took the last of their HIV medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A single mom and an only child, they've always taken their medicine together at 8 p.m. each night.

   &lt;p&gt;"In the past week, she'll open the tin [where the medicine is kept] and find that it's empty," says Theresa. "She'll run down to the clinic to go and check if she can collect her medication. And then she'll come back home and say, 'Oh, you are right. The clinic is closed. They're not there anymore.' "&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And it seems like their U.S.-funded clinic is not coming back. The doors of the clinic, which services over 2,000 HIV patients, have been locked since the end of January, the staff let go and the furniture largely removed. This clinic didn't just provide medication, it also provided basic food since HIV medicine cannot be taken on an empty stomach. Theresa and Dorcas lost both.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So far, without their medication, Theresa feels okay. But Dorcas has developed a fever and chills — and she feels weak. Flu-like symptoms are often one of the first symptoms after someone goes off HIV treatment — the level of virus rises and the body tries to fight it off.&lt;strong&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;Worried, Theresa now stays home to tend to her daughter — who often rests on a mat by the tree outside their home. But it means Theresa isn't going house to house to do laundry and odd jobs, their main source of income.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-60048" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Theresa Mwanza and her daughter, Dorcas, stand in a field near their house. After their USAID-funded clinic closed, Theresa tried to get HIV medications at a government-run clinic but was turned away and told she needed to get "direction or guidance" from that now-shuttered facility.

   &lt;p&gt;Theresa tried to get their medications at a clinic run by the Zambian government. It took an hour to walk there only to get turned away. "They keep insisting: 'You need to get direction or guidance from the clinic where you were on where you will go to next,'" she recalls. But with her neighborhood clinic closed, Theresa isn't sure what to do.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She thinks back to her two sisters who died of AIDS before medication became available — and free with help from the U.S. "I am now really worried," she says looking at her daughter. "She's a very jovial little girl, but she's been very miserable the past few days."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mary Mayongana: Thinking about 'what will become of me'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mary Mayongana, 42, typically spends her days either at the market selling vegetables or in a small family compound she shares with her family: Her mother, her four children, her two sisters and their children. "All of us live here as one big family," Mary says, speaking in Bemba.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59881" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Mary Mayongana, 42, is unsure whether her ankle sore is a result of going off her HIV medications. She says that the pain along with the fatigue she now feels are going to make it hard to walk for 45 minutes to reach the nearest clinic after the closure of the U.S.-funded clinic she had previously used.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Now, Mary is confined to that compound. She's lost access to her HIV treatment and feels weak. She's also developed an itchy &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/01/31/g-s1-45601/trump-pepfar-hiv-positive-antiretroviral-waiver" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;rash&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a classic sign of going off HIV medications — it can be an indication that the body is trying to fight off &lt;a href="https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/hiv-and-rash" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the resurgent virus&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the immune system is weakening. And Mary has another challenge: her ankle is swollen from a painful open sore that continues to spread. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Without warning, her U.S.-funded clinic closed on January 28 with a stop work order from the Trump Administration. Now the clinic's health workers are distributing the remaining supply of medications among all the patients. For more than two months, Mary hasn't been able to consistently take her HIV medication. Sometimes she's gone up to 14 days with no HIV medication at all. Right now, she has a few pills and has decided to take them every third day. It's risky because her body could develop resistance to the drug if it's not taken daily. But, Mary says, it's all she has so she needs her supply to last as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59784" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;There are Zambian government clinics that still stock HIV drugs but they've been so overwhelmed by HIV patients from the shuttered U.S.-funded clinics that they've been forced to ration the medication, giving out a limited supply to each patient. And for Mary, who has no money for transportation, the government clinic seems impossibly far away. It's a 45-minute walk on a good day.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She's unsure whether her ankle sore is a result of going off her HIV medications but, she says, the pain and fatigue she feels are going to make it hard to walk to the clinic. She thinks it will take her hours each way. Her mother is urging her to do it anyway — together, she says, they can take a few steps, then rest.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I spend a lot of time thinking about what is likely to become of me, especially that I'm actually seeing myself wasting away," says Mary in a flat, quiet voice. She sits on the cement floor of her brick home, her head resting against the wall. "It's really weighing me down."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-60045" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kabamda Willies and Alice Nyandwa: 'Volunteers that attend to us are not there'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When Kabamda Willies noticed Alice Nyandwa working in the farm fields in 2018, he immediately knew he wanted to marry her. The first thing he did was to share his HIV status. "I thought it would be wise to explain to her [that I have HIV] from the very beginning," Willies says, speaking in Bemba.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;She then told him, she too is HIV positive. They soon got married.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As subsistence farmers in a very remote area, they got their medications from a community health worker who, for years, would bike to their home with their pills, delivering a six-month supply. And he could even take their blood while sitting in their thatched gazebo and then bike it back to the lab. That suddenly stopped when the U.S. surprised the world by halting the vast majority of foreign assistance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, Kabamda and Alice go to the closest government clinic to get their HIV medications and tests. It's a 3- to 4-hour walk each way. Still, they make the journey. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59789" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Farmers Alice Nyandwa and Kabamda Willies say that they now must walk three to four hours each way to a government-run HIV clinic. Even when they get to the clinic, they sometimes can't get their medications because the volunteer staff — who used to receive stipends as part of U.S. aid — aren't there anymore.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"Sometimes when we get to the clinic, the volunteers that attend to us are not there. So we need to arrange to walk back again on another day," says Kabamda, 63. Those volunteers are missing because many of them had received a stipend from the U.S. — and that's now dried up.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even if the clinic is open and the couple can get served, there's another problem: The days when they'd get enough pills to last 6 months are gone. Now, Zambian government clinics are rationing HIV drugs. The state clinics didn't have warning about the U.S. cutting aid and didn't stock up on medications. So, with the onslaught of new patients, Kabamda and Alice say, they are being given medication for just two weeks. Kabamda says it's hard to find the time to return to the clinic so regularly because "we need to grow our food to eat."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oswell Sindaza: 'I'm moving like a headless chicken'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When Oswell Sindaza was born, the story goes, his mother looked him over — head to toe — and enthusiastically said: "All is well." And so, that became his name: Oswell.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But these days, such a happy declaration is sorely missing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59790" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                "We have over 6,400 [HIV] clients, and I'm just alone as a clinical person," says Oswell Sindaza, a doctor who used to oversee a staff of 21 nurses, doctors, pharmacists and lab technicians that was funded by U.S. foreign assistance.

   &lt;p&gt;Sindaza, who's 44, is a doctor for HIV/AIDS patients. Since 2014, he's been running a project funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development which was housed within the Wusakile Mine Hospital. Sindaza used to oversee a staff of 21, including a team of nurses, doctors, pharmacists and lab technicians. The local mining company paid his salary and so, unlike his colleagues,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;whose salaries were directly or indirectly paid by U.S. foreign aid,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;he survived the funding cuts. But now, he's the only doctor left. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We have over 6,400 [HIV] clients, and I'm just alone as a clinical person," says Oswell, adding that there's also one accountant and one nurse who were not funded by U.S. aid. His caseload grows each day as patients, desperate for HIV medications, arrive from nearby clinics that have been closed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We just give them drugs. We're not taking care of the clients' needs, things like viral load testing, liver function tests, kidney function. We do not have the capacity to do that," he says. "I'm moving like a headless chicken now just to try and make things happen."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says he worries about all the patients who can't make it to his clinic — those who live too far away or are in wheelchairs. He knows they have no medication, and he doesn't know how to help. He says he feels like he's failing his patients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's really, really draining me," Oswell says. "I feel maybe I will not manage to cope going forward."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59800" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

He's a house painter and — with the help of HIV medication, which he's taken for 15 years — he always had the strength to do his work. But no longer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I feel weakness — weak, weak, weak," he says as his voice cracks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since early February, when his local U.S.-funded clinic shut down, he's struggled to get his medication. At first, he managed to obtain a few pills here and there but, now, he's out entirely.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sitting on a wooden bench by the window with one of his three children nearby, he says he's lost a lot of weight and feels like all the power has been drained out of him.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59783" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Brian's wife also has HIV and has run out of her medication, too. But, so far, she says she feels fine.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The couple went to a nearby government clinic hoping they would be able to get their medications refilled. But, they say, they were told they must bring their medical records in order to register as new patients. So they've been going back to their old clinic to get their files. Every time they go, it's still shuttered. And yet, he says, they have no choice but to keep trying.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We need to wait until there's someone at the &lt;a href="https://www.usaid.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;USAID&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; facility," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Zambian Ministry of Health did not respond to requests for comment on this policy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Brian worries that by the time he gets his medical record and registers at a new clinic, it will be too late. "I'm going to lose my life, and I will leave my children suffering," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59798" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Geoffrey Chanda: Truck drivers are crying as they call him for medicine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Geoffrey Chanda's phone is going off almost constantly. Truck drivers are calling him. "They are crying," he says. "'We've got no [HIV] medicine. Where do you get [it] from?'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He has no good answer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For 15 years, Geoffrey — who is now 54 — has been working with HIV-positive truck drivers and sex workers who hang out around truck stops. After his own brother died of AIDS, Geoffrey left his job as a miner, saying to himself, " 'Let me teach others not to get [HIV].' "&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59799" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Community health worker Geoffrey Chanda used to distribute HIV medications to long-haul truck drivers and sex workers at truck stops like this one near the border of Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;As a community health worker, he would periodically pick up a big bag of HIV treatments from a mobile clinic. Then, he'd coordinate with over 200 truck drivers — and even more sex workers. Calling and texting them, he'd figure out when they'd be passing through the border crossing and go meet them to give them their medications and make sure they had all the information they needed about how not to spread HIV.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The dusty parking lots where Geoffrey spent his days are lined with 18-wheelers, many loaded down with freshly-mined minerals. They pause here — at the border between Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, near the town of Chililabombwe — sometimes for days, waiting for permission to cross the border.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's this type of location that public health experts have zeroed in on as critical in halting the spread of HIV. In the early days of the epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa, the virus fanned out along trucking routes as long-haul drivers frequented sex workers. Still today in Zambia, HIV is a particular challenge along the trucking routes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59797" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Long-haul truckers sometimes pause for days at this truck stop near the Zambian town of Chililabombwe as they await approval to cross the border into the Democratic Republic of Congo. Distributing HIV medicine on trucking routes is critical to stopping the spread of HIV, say public health experts.

   &lt;p&gt;Now, with U.S. aid slashed the special effort to prevent and contain the virus in these hot spots has stopped, Geoffrey says. He no longer has the medications to distribute. He no longer has his income — and, he says, he's struggling to pay for food. But, he still picks up the continuous string of calls from truck drivers and sex workers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Geoffrey estimates that about 20 of the 200 truck drivers he worked with have called and told him they're starting to fall ill without their HIV medications. He says one of his drivers died in Congo. In the arcades and bars that line the main street, Geoffrey has heard it was because the driver didn't have his HIV medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"He died in Congo. [And] bringing the body [back to Zambia], it's very expensive," says long-haul truck driver Roi Silunyange, 54, who also knew the deceased man.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-60043" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;"If you're not feeling well, or you need a supply — maybe your medicines have run out — [we] would call that number, and [the community health workers] were always very quick at coming to us and responding to our needs," Mwape says. "So it was a very, very good system. We were not missing our medications."&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Now, he says, the calls go unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daliso Tembo and Mary Tembo: 'We can't find peace at night'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sleep is hard to come by in the Tembo household.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Daliso, 49, and Mary, 32, are farmers, growing peanuts and other crops together. When night falls, they are wracked with worry about the future.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He's HIV-positive and, since his U.S.-funded clinic suddenly closed two months ago, his medications are running low. Just 20 days of pills left. She's managed to avoid contracting HIV from her husband by taking a drug from the clinic, known as PrEP, that prevents the transmission of HIV. But now, all of that is in question.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59792" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;"We can't find peace at night. Sleep has escaped us," says Mary. "We're asking ourselves: What next? What if? He doesn't like to have these conversations, but it's important that we have them."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mary plays out the worst case scenario in her mind: "If [Daliso] can't access his drugs — and let's say he falls ill and he dies — what then happens to us as a household? Because he's the head of our household. He takes care of us," she says. "And, if anything happens to me — if I find myself [HIV] positive…" Her voice trails off.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Their main concern is about their five children. The youngest is 2 years old and doesn't understand what's happening. But the older ones are worried.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They're always coming to me to say, 'Give us answers.' I always tell them, 'Let's not have this conversation,'" says Mary. "I know it's not the right thing, but I'm really trying to avoid it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Daliso and Mary went to a nearby government clinic but were told to come back later when Daliso would have only a few days of HIV pills left. Mary says that clinic is so overburdened by all the HIV patients who lost treatment when the U.S. cut aid, she's afraid they won't have any medications left for her husband.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"This change has really devastated me," Daliso says, his voice filled with emotion. "I'm a man, but what it has done, it has really shattered me."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59794-1" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

She pulls out her phone and scrolls to the emotional, religious songs. Lately, the 16-year-old has been listening to a lot of these songs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;From the two-room house — under a huge mango tree — that she shares with her grandmother, Catherine lets the lyrics of her favorite song, "Nessa's Holy Spirit," wash over her:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Jesus I need you to survive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh come oh! Holy Spirit come oh" &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Her grandmother, who has the same name, says Catherine has been grappling with two questions for which there are no good answers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"She began to ask why she's taking this medication, and then I had to explain to her that 'You're HIV positive,' " says Catherine's grandmother. The girl got the virus from her mother at birth but, her grandmother says, "it's been very difficult to get her to accept her situation. She says, 'What is it that I have done to get this illness?' "&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Holy Spirit come,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Come and have your way"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Lately Catherine's question of "why" has been superseded by the question of "how." How will she get her next round of HIV medications when the health center where she got her free HIV medications was funded by the U.S. and has now shut down. She has one month's supply left and she worries that all the government clinics will charge money for the medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59793" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reverend Billiance Chondwe: Bringing back memories of his twin's death from AIDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As a child, Billiance Chondwe did everything with his twin sister, Charity. They insisted on just one shared dinner plate. They requested coordinated clothes. He played jump rope with her, ignoring the taunts of neighborhood children for playing a girl's game.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then — in the late 1990s — when they were 17, Charity got AIDS. Billy nursed her month after month. If he left the house, she would call out for him. He missed school to tend to her. When she died almost a year later, the grief was overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What I felt was: I'm alone," recalls Billy, who is now 52. "It brought me to my knees. It brought me to a point where, no matter what I can do as a human being, there is a limit."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For years, he couldn't shake the smell of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then, in 2004, things started to change. There was a big push by the U.S. government to get HIV medication to Zambia, along with dozens of other countries. Since then, the U.S. has poured nearly $7 billion into controlling the HIV epidemic in Zambia, providing free HIV medications for 1.2 million Zambians.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For Billy, it felt like a weight was lifted. "Despair was taken away," he says. "Children had hope they will grow [up] with their father."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And then, earlier this year, came the sudden pullout of U.S. aid. Overnight, clinics were locked and shutters were bolted shut. All the doctors, nurses, community health workers and volunteers were told to stop working immediately. Patients lost access to their files — and, most important, their medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-60049" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Reverend Billy is haunted by the memory of people dying during the height of the AIDS crisis in the 1990s. The recent pullout of U.S. foreign aid has brought back feelings of hopelessness and despair.&lt;br&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Now — at Billy's branch of the Pentecostal Holiness Church in Zambia — he watches his congregation shrink as parishioners stay home, sick or tending to the sick who can't find another source of HIV medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Yesterday, I received three calls: Two of my members — they are admitted in the hospital. And I received another [call] from a couple — they are sick," says Pastor Billy. The hopelessness he felt during the years when there was no treatment for AIDS has returned.

CWD was reported in Putnam, Marshall, Adams, and Peoria counties, expanding the geographic presence of the disease in free-ranging deer populations in northern Illinois, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adams County is the first documented case recorded outside of the leading edge of the CWD endemic region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CWD is an always-fatal neurological disease that affects the long-term health of white-tailed deer in Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CWD was first documented in Illinois in 2002 near Roscoe. It has since been detected in 25 counties across northern Illinois and now as far south as Adams County in west-central Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early February 2025, CWD was detected and confirmed through diagnostic testing in Putnam, Marshall, and Adams counties from routine surveillance of hunter-harvested deer. Peoria County was confirmed in a 2-year-old deer exhibiting clinical signs consistent with CWD infection using the same diagnostic testing procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samples from Adams County underwent genetic testing to ensure genetic matches between submitted tissue samples and source deer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affected Illinois counties now include Adams, Boone, Bureau, Carroll, Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Ford, Grundy, Jo Daviess, Kane, Kankakee, Kendall, Lake, LaSalle, Lee, Livingston, Marshall, McHenry, Ogle, Peoria, Putnam, Stephenson, Will, and Winnebago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Illinois is a national leader in managing and slowing the spread of CWD, and over the past two decades IDNR’s program has served as a model for other states,” said IDNR Director Natalie Phelps Finnie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization and the &lt;a href="https://dnr.illinois.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; and Prevention have not linked CWD to human transmission. However, they recommend against eating meat from CWD-positive deer.

&lt;p&gt;“Get the flu shot and you are 27% more likely to get the flu!” read an April 7 X post that referenced a preprint study published on April 4. “GET THE SHOT GET THE DISEASE!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="more-on"&gt;&lt;h2 class="more-on__heading"&gt;Recommended Stories &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list of 3 items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 1 of 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 2 of 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 3 of 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;end of list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, another X post trumpeted news of the study with a call for action: “All flu ‘vaccines’ must be pulled from the market pending large prospective studies of their safety and effectiveness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warnings cite a non-peer-reviewed article by Cleveland Clinic researchers titled Effectiveness of the Influenza Vaccine During the 2024-2025 Respiratory Viral Season. It was posted on April 4 on the preprint server medRxiv, which discloses in bold typeface at the top that it “reports new medical research that has yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-the-study-says-and-what-it-does-not"&gt;What the study says – and what it does not&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study involved 53,402 Cleveland Clinic Health System employees in Ohio and found that its vaccinated participants had a higher incidence of infection in the most recent flu season. But a Cleveland Clinic spokesperson said it’s misleading to use the study to draw broader conclusions about vaccines and susceptibility to infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The data came from a relatively healthy population of about 50,000 healthcare workers and did not represent the general population,” Cleveland Clinic spokesperson Andrea Pacetti said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flu vaccine helps prevent flu cases from getting more severe and requiring hospitalisation. Every year, the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee decides which viruses to use for the upcoming season’s flu vaccine. Data collected by the FDA, World Health Organization, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other partners on which flu strains are circulating around the world inform that committee’s decision. (The committee’s meeting to discuss influenza vaccine strains for the 2025-2026 influenza season was cancelled.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, during seasons when the flu vaccine strains and the circulating flu strains match, the vaccine “has been shown to reduce the risk of having to go to the doctor with flu by 40% to 60%”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert H Hopkins Jr, the medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, said the Cleveland Clinic study does not evaluate the primary benefit for getting vaccinated against influenza: reducing one’s risk for severe illness, hospitalisation and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People should be aware that the effectiveness of flu vaccines vary from year to year, but even when flu vaccination does not prevent infection completely, it can make the illness milder and prevent serious complications, including hospitalisation and death,” Hopkins said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopkins said he “completely” disagrees with the social media post calling for flu vaccines’ removal from the market. “That action would result in more &lt;a href="/news/2025/3/3/rfk-jr-noted-vaccine-sceptic-backs-measles-jab-amid-deadly-us-outbreak"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; and death from flu,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nabin Shrestha, a physician and coauthor of the study, said although the results found an increased risk of influenza among vaccinated participants, the authors understood that the increased risk “could have been from an unrecognised factor” and, therefore, did not conclude that the vaccine increases infection risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shrestha also said the study did not suggest that the influenza vaccine should be pulled from the market because it makes people more likely to get the flu. “Overall, the flu vaccine is an important public health tool,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who participated in the study? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleveland Clinic requires workers to get the annual flu vaccine or seek a medical- or religion-based exemption, so this study involved a high number of vaccinated people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the participants, 43,857 were vaccinated during the study period with 98.7 percent receiving the inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine. By the study’s end, 1,079 participants had gotten the flu – roughly 2 percent of the entire study population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacetti said it was notable that only 2 percent of the participants contracted influenza during the study period. “The population did not include children and contained very few elderly or immunocompromised individuals,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study’s results indicated the cumulative incidence of influenza – or the number of new cases divided by the total number of people in the study at risk (vaccinated and not vaccinated) – increased faster among the vaccinated participants than the unvaccinated ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors found that the influenza vaccine had a negative effectiveness, “suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza” for that season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do these findings mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flu vaccine effectiveness can vary per season and per person (factoring in characteristics such as age and health), the CDC said. Their effectiveness also depends on their similarity to the influenza viruses circulating in the community, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from the agency showed seasonal flu vaccine effectiveness – or how well the vaccine prevents severe illness and hospitalisation – changes per season with a 42 percent effectiveness rate during the 2023-2024 season. Researchers found it reduced the risk for flu-related outpatient visits and hospitalisations among children, adolescents and adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopkins said the study did not discuss if the workplace had masking policies or other restrictions for unvaccinated employees, which “could have an important impact on the incidence of influenza”, especially for those working in clinical settings. About 10,900 participants had a clinical nursing job, the study said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacetti and Jeffrey Morris, biostatistics director at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, also said the vaccines primarily reduce the risk of death or severe disease, which the study does not address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article said the vaccine’s effectiveness in any given year “depends on how similar the strains contained in the vaccine are to the strains causing infection that year”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors also said because nearly all of its participants used the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, it’s possible that other influenza vaccines may have been more effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Al Jazeera</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 11:10:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMisgFBVV95cUxPWXZhUzU4Yk1saUd2Z2pSY0YxX1hHcHBCcWpmd3laR21xVXBDWmlsbmNHSTgyaFVoM0UtMUMwdDJQdDI4SjZUbHItSkFhWmdXYm1fb0VoeXd2bEFJVWRZRUNUT3NVeHdTRHpkQTBVcG1lSHB3VTJVYTJobUxaU3hubGZvNW5KU0xEZUJfSFZPUHUtSU9rOWxTeVU2SGVXbUNtTFkxaU5Yb1hiZ2lLQ19HczVR0gG3AUFVX3lxTE1heFpQLTBOQk9mMlFseF9mY19OUEJvVFJXMkNmNnRTc2dhRWg3Tk8tcnhJeE11WGRRU2NBdkNtRlhfeW52RzRiV1VrZzkydnQ2ektzWW5GWWlpaDIydVdNdnZuRmpoSUk1anF1OHpqSTFBeVB2V3ZfdU1QQVVBUEJidDBYdWlMbmxtbUdqNzM0ODhTakVVOFQxUnZMVGtBRUYxcWkxcGhuME5sZlRtRl9hRlBPeWxuUQ</guid></item><item><title>“不仅仅是麻疹” ：随着疫苗接种率的下降，百日咳病例飙升- CNN | ‘Not just measles’: Whooping cough cases are soaring as vaccine rates decline - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijwFBVV95cUxOb3VUZGRTREN6cDdDeEtMUE5KTzM1STQ1VjZKQTBUalRKNHQ4SWVDcjNBWndtTUdRN0k5RG84djRoYWpOZjNiT05wbDNJTHFldWRUWVhyeFBGaHNzTk1lekJ1TFNqeldYalM1Wi1aWjlkZXkwRHBRQ0F1aXpJN2FDd2RtS1pVOWg5N0I1MGx3VdIBhgFBVV95cUxQZXBQSWt4VkhjeWZ3Wm1Zd0RwVkFGWUNlZnNCX1JaNGd6eXU1TzVUVHpaT2gxZGt6bDJteXJtcVJqdENTNmxRUVlTQy1KSE03aDM5MWw4bHVyLWg2V2Fab2NzUmRHUlZ4WWRXRnUybWZkRnpZX2ZMR280UUVFNEZPY0stMkVCdw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            In the past six months, two babies in Louisiana have died of pertussis, the disease commonly known as whooping cough.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Washington state recently announced its first confirmed death from pertussis in more than a decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sl000c3b6ouxv4tpwi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Idaho and South Dakota each reported a death this year, and Oregon last year reported two as well as its highest number of cases since 1950.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            While much of the country is focused on the spiraling measles outbreak concentrated in the small, dusty towns of West Texas, cases of pertussis have skyrocketed by more than 1,500% nationwide since hitting a recent low in 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Deaths tied to the disease are also up, hitting 10 last year, compared with about two to four in previous years. Cases are on track to exceed that total this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o06s00093b6ogu8tyzg0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors, researchers and public health experts warn that the measles outbreak, which has grown to more than 600 cases, may just be the beginning. They say outbreaks of preventable diseases could get much worse with falling vaccination rates and the Trump administration slashing spending on the country’s public health infrastructure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sm000h3b6oxzosf3n5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            National rates for four major vaccines, which had held relatively steady in the years before the COVID-19 pandemic, have fallen significantly since, according to a ProPublica analysis of the most recent federal kindergarten vaccination data. Not only have vaccination rates for measles, mumps and rubella fallen, but federal data shows that so have those for pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B and polio.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sm000i3b6oc6jfohfr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition, public health experts say that growing pockets of unvaccinated populations across the country place babies and young children in danger should there be a resurgence of these diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sm000l3b6o1gtzq3f6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many medical authorities view measles, which is especially contagious, as the canary in the coal mine, but pertussis cases may also be a warning, albeit one that has attracted far less attention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sm000m3b6o3qsr24nm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is not just measles,” said Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious diseases doctor in New York City and author of the book “Booster Shots: The Urgent Lessons of Measles and the Uncertain Future of Children’s Health.” “It’s a bright-red warning light.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sm000n3b6oui3ipol7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At least 36 states have witnessed a drop in rates for at least one key vaccine from the 2013-14 to the 2023-24 school years. And half of states have seen an across-the-board decline in all four vaccination rates. Wisconsin, Utah and Alaska have experienced some of the most precipitous drops during that time, with declines of more than 10 percentage points in some cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sm000o3b6oume8rc45@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is a direct correlation between vaccination rates and vaccine-preventable disease outbreak rates,” said a spokesperson for the Utah Department of Health and Human Services. “Decreases in vaccination rates will likely lead to more outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in Utah.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d412u200913b6our7c62bb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But statewide figures alone don’t provide a full picture. Tucked inside each state are counties and communities with far lower vaccination rates that drive outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn003t3b6oui1qjj53@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For example, the whooping cough vaccination rate for kindergartners in Washington state in 2023-24 was 90.2%, slightly below the U.S. rate of 92.3%, federal data shows. But the statewide rate for children 19 to 35 months last year was 65.4%, according to state data. In four counties, that rate was in the 30% range. In one county, it was below 12%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn003u3b6o1b1drajs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My concern is that there is going to be a large outbreak of not just measles, but other vaccine-preventable diseases as well, that’s going to end up causing a lot of harm, and possibly deaths in children and young adults,” said Dr. Anna Durbin, a professor in the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who has spent her career studying vaccines. “And it’s completely preventable.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn003v3b6ox7b4almd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The dramatic cuts to public health funding and staffing could heighten the risk. And the elevation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, to the secretary of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, several experts said, has only compounded matters.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn003w3b6ois9xqhhk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Trump administration has eliminated 20,000 jobs at agencies within HHS, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the nation’s public health agency. And late last month, the administration also cut $11 billion from state and local public health agencies on the front lines of protecting Americans from outbreaks; the administration said the money was no longer necessary after the end of the pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn003x3b6oiunra599@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Several city and county public health officials had to move quickly to lay off nurses, epidemiologists and disease inspectors. Some ceased vaccination clinics, halted wastewater surveillance programs and even terminated a contract with the courier service that transports specimens to state labs to test for infectious diseases. One Minnesota public health agency, which had provided 1,400 shots for children at clinics last year, immediately stopped those clinics when the directive arrived, court records show.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            A federal judge temporarily barred HHS from enacting the cuts, but the ruling, which came more than a week after the grants were terminated, was too late for programs that had already been canceled and employees who had already been laid off. Lawyers for HHS have asked the judge to reconsider her decision in light of a recent Supreme Court ruling that allowed the Department of Education to terminate grants for teacher training while that case is being argued in lower courts. The judge in the HHS case has not yet ruled on the motion.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn003z3b6o8wgdkjov@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But in tiny storefronts and cozy homes, at school fairs and gas stations, many residents in West Texas, near where the measles outbreak has taken hold, appear unfazed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00403b6o28docmo2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I don’t need a vaccine,” one man sitting on his porch said recently. “I don’t get sick.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00413b6o24l8d6aa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s measles. It’s been around forever,” said a woman making her way to her car. “I don’t think it’s a big deal.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00423b6orrcgbvdj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When asked why they weren’t planning on vaccinating their baby, a husband walking alongside his wife who was 27 weeks pregnant simply said, “It’s God’s will.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d41jxi00943b6oceg4eb66@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In word and deed, Kennedy has sown doubt about immunizations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00443b6o2116cjsl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In response to the measles outbreak, Kennedy initially said in a column he wrote for Fox News that the decision to vaccinate is a “personal one.” HHS sent doses of vitamin A alongside vaccines to Texas, and Kennedy praised the use of cod liver oil. Only the vaccine prevents measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00453b6oikgs4ecd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About a week later, in an interview on Fox News, while Kennedy encouraged vaccines, he said he was a “freedom of choice person.” At the same time, he emphasized the risks of the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00463b6oqpsd77zy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Only after the second measles death in Texas did &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414" target="_blank"&gt;Kennedy post&lt;/a&gt; on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the “most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00473b6o7k74r7mt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But even that is not the unequivocal message that the head of HHS should be sending, said Ratner, the infectious diseases doctor in New York. It is, he said, a tepid recommendation at best.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00483b6orkb3o5mi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It gives the impression that these things are equivalent, that you can choose one or the other, and that is disingenuous,” he said. “We don’t have a treatment for measles. We have vitamin A, which we can give to kids with measles, that decreases but doesn’t eliminate the risk of severe outcomes. It doesn’t do anything for prevention of measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00493b6oqyol1duz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the past, Kennedy has been a fierce critic of the vaccine. In a foreword to a 2021 book on measles released by the nonprofit that he founded, Kennedy wrote, “Measles outbreaks have been fabricated to create fear that in turn forces government officials to ‘do something.’ They then inflict unnecessary and risky vaccines on millions of children for the sole purpose of fattening industry profits.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004a3b6o1qw1ipve@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A spokesperson for HHS said, “Secretary Kennedy is not anti-vaccine — he is pro-safety, pro-transparency and pro-accountability.” Kennedy, the spokesperson said, responded to the measles outbreak with “clear guidance that vaccines are the most effective way to prevent measles” and under his leadership, the CDC updated its pediatric patient management protocol for measles to include physician-administered vitamin A.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004b3b6ojnblk0gx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy, the spokesperson added, “is uniquely qualified to lead HHS at this pivotal moment.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004c3b6ozfl95v7a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Late last month, leaders at the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/measles-vaccine-rfk-cdc-report" target="_blank"&gt;ordered staff to bury a risk assessment&lt;/a&gt; that emphasized the need for vaccines in response to the measles outbreak — in spite of the fact the CDC has long &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/partners/vaccinate-with-confidence.html" target="_blank"&gt;promoted vaccinations&lt;/a&gt; as a cornerstone of public health. While a CDC spokesperson acknowledged that vaccines offer the best protection from measles, she also repeated a line Kennedy had used: “The decision to vaccinate is a personal one.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004d3b6o5h2nf56i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among the approximately 2,400 jobs eliminated at the CDC was a team in the Immunization Services Division that partnered with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-equity/php/about/partnering-for-vaccine-equity-partners.html" target="_blank"&gt;organizations&lt;/a&gt; to promote access to and confidence in vaccines in communities where coverage lagged.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004e3b6o0s1lr9d5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The National Institutes of Health, which is also under HHS, recently ended funding for studies that examine vaccine hesitancy. In early April, researchers, the American Public Health Association and one of the largest unions in the country sued the NIH and its director, Jay Bhattacharya, along with HHS and Kennedy, alleging they terminated grants “without scientifically-valid explanation or cause.” The government hasn’t filed a response in the case.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004f3b6oy2nxc4w2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The NIH cancellation notices stated that the agency’s policy was not to prioritize research that focuses on “gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004g3b6o83v3iigh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These grants are being canceled in the midst of an outbreak, a vaccine-preventable outbreak,” said Rupali Limaye, an associate professor at George Mason University who has spent the past decade studying vaccine hesitancy. “We need to better understand why people are not accepting vaccines now more than ever. This outbreak is still spreading.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004h3b6oa70j5ggw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That vaccines prevent diseases is settled science. For decades, there was a societal understanding that getting vaccinated benefited not only the person who got the shot, but also the broader community, especially babies or people with weakened immune systems, like those in chemotherapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004i3b6onzafa7c7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An investment in public health and a sustained, large-scale approach to vaccines is what helped the country declare the elimination of the measles in 2000, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, the CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004j3b6o4fsr40cl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But she has watched both deteriorate over the last few months. Nearly every morning since notices of the federal funding cuts began going out to local public health agencies, she has woken up to texts from panicked public health workers. She has led daily calls with local health departments and sat in on multiple emergency board meetings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004k3b6o7vafb83w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Freeman has compiled a list of more than 100 direct consequences of the cuts, including one rural health department in the Midwest that can no longer carry out immunization services. That’s vital because there are no hospitals in the county and all public health duties fall to the health department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004l3b6o4eo1g15e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s relentless,” she said. “It feels like a barrage and assault on public health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004m3b6obcf2ywx2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than 1,600 miles away from Washington, D.C., in Lubbock, Texas, the director of the city’s health department, Katherine Wells, sighed last week when she saw the most recent measles numbers. She would have to alert her staff to work late again.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004n3b6ofamj15c1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s a lot of cases,” she said, “and we continue to see more and more cases.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004o3b6oirt2j4ug@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She didn’t know it at the time, but that night would mark the state’s second measles death this year. An earlier death in February was the country’s first in a decade. Both children were not vaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004p3b6orw5icw9w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy said he traveled to Gaines County to comfort the family who lost their 8-year-old daughter and while there met with the family of the 6-year-old girl who died in February.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004q3b6o7j739b4p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He also visited with two local doctors he described as “extraordinary healers,” he said in his post on X. The men, he claimed, have “treated and healed some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children” using aerosolized budesonide — typically used to prevent symptoms of asthma — and clarithromycin — an antibiotic. Medical experts said neither is an effective measles treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004r3b6o1unee47i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            State health officials have traced about two-thirds of the measles cases in Texas to Gaines County, which sits on the western edge of the state.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004s3b6ooulh4kus@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Seminole, one of the county’s only two incorporated towns, has emerged as the epicenter of the outbreak, with Tina Siemens acting as a community ambassador of sorts.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004t3b6ohfm8q2b7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Siemens, a tall woman with glasses and a short blonde bob, runs a museum that combines the area’s Native American history and Mennonite community with traditional skills like calligraphy and canning fruit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004u3b6o7r0hswui@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On a recent Tuesday, atop the museum’s dark coffee table, notes scrawled onto white paper listed the latest shipments of vitamin C and Alaskan cod liver oil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004v3b6ozfcf6xxb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The supplies, Siemens said, were for one of the local doctors who met with Kennedy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004w3b6oz02xu2hs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As measles tears through the community, Siemens said families have to decide whether to get vaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004x3b6oahxj5yfv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In America, we have a choice,” she said, echoing Kennedy’s messaging. “The cod liver oil that was flown in, the vitamin C that was flown in, was a great help.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004y3b6oitpofuug@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Philip Huang, director and health authority for the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department, is working to keep the measles outbreak from reaching his community, just five hours east of Seminole. He wrote letters to the public school superintendents and leaders of private schools that had large numbers of unvaccinated or undervaccinated students offering to set up mobile vaccine clinics for them.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004z3b6ou38lo62l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Overall, the rates can look OK,” he said, “but when you’ve got these pockets of unvaccinated, that’s where the vulnerability lies.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00503b6oyc8d96am@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Huang has had to lay off 11 full-time employees, 10 temporary workers and cancel more than 50 vaccine clinics following the HHS cuts. The systemic dismantling of the CDC and other federal health agencies, he said, will have a grave and lasting impact.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00513b6ocn9votuv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is setting us back decades,” Huang said. “Everyone should be extremely concerned about what’s going on.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00523b6owlqdlai8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Across the country, pediatricians are petrified, said Dr. Susan Kressly, who serves as president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the largest professional organization of pediatricians in the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00533b6oebeebuy8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Many of us are losing sleep,” Kressly said. “If we lose that progress, children will pay the price.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00543b6oul37gr61@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She’s carefully watching the spread of several vaccine-preventable diseases, including an increase in whooping cases that far outpace the typical peaks seen every few years. Although the whooping cough vaccine isn’t as effective as the ones for measles and protection wanes over time, the CDC says it remains the best way to prevent the disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00553b6o9r9fe7ta@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Babies under the age of 1 are among the most at risk of severe complications from whooping cough, including slowed or stopped breathing and pneumonia, according to the CDC. About one-third of infants who get whooping cough end up in the hospital. Newborns are especially vulnerable because the CDC doesn’t recommend the first shot until two months. That’s why experts recommend pregnant mothers and anyone who will be around the baby to get vaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00563b6o2mp9c90y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The number of whooping cough cases dropped significantly during the pandemic, but it exploded in recent years. In 2021, the CDC reported 2,116 cases; last year, there were 35,435.

            The numbers this year appear set to eclipse 2024. So far in 2025, 7,111 cases have been reported, which is more than double this time last year. Cases tend to spike in the summer and fall, which adds to experts’ concern about high numbers so early in the year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00583b6ofndyr6ro@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            States on the Pacific Coast and in the Midwest have reported the most cases this year, with Washington leading the country with 742 cases so far, more than five times as many as at this time last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The Washington child who died of whooping cough had no underlying medical conditions, according to a spokesperson for the Spokane Regional Health District. The death was announced in February but occurred in November.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005a3b6ofo8tbqm3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While Washington’s overall vaccination rate for whooping cough has remained relatively steady over the last decade at around 90%, pockets of low vaccination rates have allowed the disease to take root and put the wider community at risk, said Dr. Tao Sheng Kwan-Gett, a pediatrician and chief health officer of the Washington State Department of Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005b3b6op6ev6cqm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is the time to strengthen the public health system, he said, to build trust in those areas and make it easier for children to get their routine vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005c3b6o2zjre9qf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But instead, we’re seeing the exact opposite happen,” he said. “We’re weakening our public health system, and that will put us on a path towards more illness and shorter lives.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005d3b6oskrkcxpv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Washington was one of 23 states and the District of Columbia that sued HHS and Kennedy following the $11 billion cuts, which rescinded approximately $118 million from the state. Doing so, the state said in court records, would impact 150 full-time employees and cause an immediate reduction in the agency’s ability to respond to outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005e3b6o0ike7y3i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Washington’s Care-A-Van, a mobile health clinic that travels across the state to provide vaccinations, conduct blood pressure screenings and distribute opioid overdose kits, was a key element in the department’s vaccination efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005f3b6osvm6zf41@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But that, too, has been diminished.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            An alert on the department’s website cataloged the impact.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005h3b6o3wjfc9d9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Attention,” it began.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            As a result of the unexpected decision to terminate grant funding, “all Care-A-Van operations have been paused indefinitely, including the cancellation of more than 104 upcoming clinics across the state.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005j3b6okqdhiijr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The department had anticipated providing approximately 2,000 childhood vaccines as part of that effort.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005k3b6oi9d8g1mj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The frustration came through in Kwan-Gett’s voice. Many people think that federal cuts to public health mean shrinking the federal workforce, he said, but those clawbacks also get passed down to states and cities and counties. The less federal support that trickles down to the local level, the less protected communities will be.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005l3b6oebzc9wdk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It really breaks my heart,” he said, “when I see children suffering from preventable diseases like whooping cough and measles when we have the tools to prevent them.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

A recent study revealed that the average human brain may contain the equivalent of a whopping five plastic bottle caps' worth of microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The New York Times took a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/well/microplastics-health.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:deeper dive;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;deeper dive&lt;/a&gt; into the topic on the heels of that study making the rounds in February, showing that scientists are only beginning to scratch the surface of what this could mean for our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/hBueN" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:groundbreaking study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;groundbreaking study&lt;/a&gt; led by researchers at the University of New Mexico, scientists found that brain samples from 2024 contained nearly 50% more microplastics than those from just eight years ago. The average brain held roughly seven grams of plastic — the same as a disposable spoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More concerning still, the researchers observed higher levels of microplastics in the brains of people with dementia, though as the Times noted, the scientists at the lab "noted that might be because those brains have a more porous blood-brain barrier and are less able to clear toxins." Similar plastic particles have already been found in the human &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/199/1/81/7609801?login=true" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:placenta;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;placenta&lt;/a&gt;, bloodstream, and even a baby's first stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As plastic accumulation balloons in the environment, it mirrors this growth in our bodies. "This stuff is increasing in our world exponentially," toxicologist Dr. Matthew Campen told &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/well/microplastics-health.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The New York Times;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is this discovery concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Once they enter the human body, some microplastic particles are so small they can pass through critical barriers and lodge in organs like the brain. While scientists haven't yet nailed down how much plastic is too much, early research findings suggest nothing short of dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Cue the groans of hopelessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I don't think I've talked to a single person who's said: 'Fantastic! Love to know that there's all that plastic in my brain,'" Dr. Campen told the Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Current research shows links between microplastics and serious health issues, including cognitive decline, reproductive concerns, immune system disruption, memory loss, hormonal disruptions, and even developmental problems in children. And because most of this plastic waste is decades old, it's not just a problem of the future — it's already here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Additionally, since microplastics also seep into the soil, water, and pollute the ecosystems, they pose a threat not only to people, but also to the wildlife and food systems we rely on. In short, this isn't simply a medical concern — it is a public health and environmental challenge with severe global implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about it?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Times' deep dive, which has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/well/microplastics-health.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:many more fascinating details;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;many more fascinating details&lt;/a&gt;, noted that Dr. Campden's team is continuing its research and "now studying tissue from cross-sections of a single brain to find out whether certain regions have higher microplastics concentrations and whether that could be linked to issues like Parkinson's or memory loss."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While researchers continue to investigate the health impacts of microplastics, efforts are already underway to tackle the problem from multiple fronts. Countries like France, England, and India have introduced bans on common single-use plastics, while cities including Los Angeles and New York are restricting items like Styrofoam and plastic produce bags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;From the scientific viewpoint, researchers are developing new materials that break down more easily and are even testing innovative ways to filter microplastics from water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On the individual level, practicing habits like swapping out &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-less-plastic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:single-use plastics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;single-use plastics&lt;/a&gt; for reusable alternatives, avoiding microwaving food in plastic containers, and using microfiber-catching laundry bags can all go a long way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/tech-newsletter/?recH1BXENM1cVWFva" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for weekly updates on the latest innovations &lt;strong&gt;improving our lives&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;shaping our future&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 10:45:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxQTmNjQW9WYXNCMHZGVXZHU3hTbmdkUTRfV19tR0UyZ2lxNzAyTmRpSEVXWXVsZjNIUkQ0TEJHRWxORk1FS2ZXZS1RUjc1ODNDbG4za1RyMHdNT01UcURSRkdnTUx3alVmQWtTcG9sVkwxdGVtMVlvZHNIOU9OQ290al9xWWlzd1pXZ0E</guid></item><item><title>根据营养师的说法，一天中服用维生素B12以最大限度吸收的最佳时间- EatingWell | The Best Time of Day to Take Vitamin B12 for Maximum Absorption, According to Dietitians - EatingWell</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE90T2pkWlZOcW5LdktqTmtYVUJaTWdVazlFYmZDd09sUngzNlNpMWdQSVljVF80Wl9MVmRmVG1PeHVfYXRKaFhHT2tpQ0ROeUpMNmhfRmdwS0ZaTkxyVE5uamlnenBpMkJiRTZZY2VDWGNYRnM?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="mntl-sc-page_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-page mntl-block structured-content" data-sc-sticky-offset="90" data-sc-ad-label-height="24" data-sc-ad-track-spacing="100" data-sc-min-track-height="250" data-sc-max-track-height="600" data-sc-breakpoint="50em" data-sc-load-immediate="4" data-sc-content-positions="[1, 1250, 1550, 1950, 2350, 2750, 3150, 3550, 3950]" data-bind-scroll-on-start="true"&gt;&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_1-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The red blood cells that course through your veins, the protective covering that surrounds your nerve fibers and the genetic information that is tightly packed into your cells all rely on one key nutrient—&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/vitamin-b12-benefits-8676211" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin B12&lt;/a&gt;. Yet nearly 12.5% of the people in the U.S. aged 19 or older are not getting enough of this essential vitamin.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is particularly common among older adults, people who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet and individuals with certain digestive disorders. If you fall into one of these groups, you may have been advised to take a vitamin B12 supplement. However, in order to unlock your supplement’s full potential, timing may be just as important as the supplement itself. So, we asked dietitians for their expertise on the best time to take vitamin B12 for maximum absorption.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can find vitamin B12 supplements in four different forms: cyanocobalamin, methylcobalamin, hydroxocobalamin and adenosylcobalamin.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.edwinaclark.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Edwina Clark, M.S., RD, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian, highlights their unique properties:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyanocobalamin&lt;/strong&gt;: The most common, cost-effective and stable form with a well-established record for safety and efficacy. It is synthetically produced and must be converted into active forms that the body can readily use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methylcobalamin: &lt;/strong&gt;An active form naturally found in animal foods that is readily used by the body. It also has a strong track record for safety and efficacy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hydroxocobalamin:&lt;/strong&gt; Often given as an injection, this form of vitamin B12 lasts longer in the bloodstream and is used to treat severe deficiencies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adenosylcobalamin: &lt;/strong&gt;A naturally active form that is present in the mitochondria (powerhouse of the cell) and involved in energy production. However, it is less commonly available and not as well studied as other forms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The dosage and delivery (supplement vs. intramuscular injection) should be personalized to the individual and adjusted as lab levels change. For those with malabsorption issues, intramuscular B12 injections may be necessary. For others, oral B12 supplements can be effective for raising vitamin B12 and typically cost far less,” Clark explains.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Oral B12 supplements can vary in form, with options ranging from tablets and sprays to drops placed under the tongue. Studies suggest there is no difference in efficacy between the different delivery methods.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-optimal-timing-for-vitamin-b12-intake"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Optimal Timing for Vitamin B12 Intake &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While research hasn’t nailed down a set-in-stone time for optimal absorption, taking your vitamin B12 supplement in the morning before breakfast is often recommended. Here’s why: &lt;a href="https://www.delishknowledge.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alexandra Caspero, M.A., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian specializing in plant-based nutrition, shares that vitamin B12 absorption peaks around 7 hours after taking it, which is why many practitioners suggest incorporating it into your morning routine to reap its benefits throughout the day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To make it easier to remember, Clark recommends pairing your B12 supplement with an existing habit, like brushing your teeth in the morning. After all, B12 is a water-soluble vitamin, meaning it doesn’t stick around in your body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Therefore, consistency is crucial for keeping your B12 levels up and correcting any deficiency.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-factors-affecting-vitamin-b12-absorption"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Factors Affecting Vitamin B12 Absorption &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Getting the timing right is just one part of the equation. Other factors can either help or hinder the absorption of vitamin B12.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Factors That Enhance Absorption &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to enhancing vitamin B12 absorption, the dose matters. “B12 is absorbed differently than other B vitamins, and that’s because of intrinsic factor, a protein found in the stomach that is needed for proper B12 absorption. We only absorb about 1 microgram of B12 at a time, though that number can vary based on the dose,” says Caspero.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For this reason, you will notice that vitamin B12 supplements contain a higher amount of B12 than is normally found in food.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “For those who consume B12 throughout the day from animal products, this isn’t usually a concern. However, for vegans and vegetarians, if taking only a single supplement, then a higher dose is needed,” Caspero explains. As such, she suggests that adults take at least 25 micrograms of vitamin B12 daily, with higher doses of 50 to 250 micrograms during pregnancy and lactation to support absorption and address deficiencies.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, it’s always best to consult your health care provider to evaluate your B12 levels and determine the dosage that’s right for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Factors That Prevent Absorption &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Absorbing vitamin B12 isn’t always a smooth process, as there are several factors that can complicate its uptake in the body. For instance, inadequate stomach acid and intrinsic factor can hinder absorption. “Stomach acid helps cleave B12 from food, and intrinsic factor is essential for transporting B12 into the small intestine. However, various conditions and medications can reduce stomach acid and intrinsic factor, raising your risk of B12 deficiency,” says Clark. These include pernicious anemia, certain medications like antacids and metformin, gastric bypass surgery and even older age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Additionally, Clark points out that gastrointestinal (GI) conditions, such as celiac disease, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, can impair absorption in the small intestines, contributing to low B12 levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-potential-side-effects-and-considerations"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Potential Side Effects and Considerations &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin B12 supplements are well-tolerated and safe for most people. In fact, the Food and Nutrition Board hasn’t set a Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for B12, which is the maximum safe dose unlikely to cause adverse health effects. This is because B12 is water-soluble, so your body uses what it needs and flushes the rest out through your urine. Therefore, even in large doses, B12 is considered safe.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, Clark highlights that, on rare occasions, some people experience adverse reactions after taking vitamin B12, including diarrhea and itchy skin.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Caspero adds that there have also been reports of acne-like symptoms when vitamin B12 is taken in large, daily doses over 1000 micrograms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Optimal levels of vitamin B12 are required for red blood cell formation, DNA synthesis and to protect nerve fibers. Supplementation is often recommended for those following a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291622/the-health-benefits-of-eating-a-plant-based-diet-and-how-to-get-started/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based eating pattern&lt;/a&gt;, older adults and individuals with digestive conditions. To get the most out of your supplement, dietitians recommend taking it first thing in the morning. However, the most important factor is to remember to take your supplement consistently. Just be sure to consult with your health care provider to discuss potential medication interactions and determine the best form and dosage for your individual needs.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Your stomach can’t break down inulin, she said, so it passes into your intestines undigested. Once there, the inulin helps nourish the good bacteria that make up your &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/02/22/well/eat/gut-microbiome-health.html" title=""&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;When these good bacteria feed off the inulin in asparagus and other fiber-rich foods, they produce compounds that play a role in &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2023.1224092/full" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;preventing inflammation&lt;/a&gt; in your intestines, Dr. Klingbeil said.

Carrier eventually switched doctors and says her access to antibiotics changed. Among other things, her new doctor was concerned about antibiotic resistance, which happens when the bacteria no longer responds to certain antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I’d used [antibiotics] probably three times a week for about a year at that point,” she says.

However, it’s important to talk to your doctor about this since some infections won’t clear up without the right course of antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take antibiotics only when prescribed&lt;/strong&gt;.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when the mom-of-two walked into the house she was horrified to find Elynn on the floor with a 'bulging' face and 'flat' head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fearing for her daughter's life, Jordan rushed her to hospital where a CT scan confirmed she had suffered &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14334287/Father-accused-googling-make-child-disabled-bid-newborn-son-brain-damage-claim-benefits-family-court-case.html"&gt;multiple skull fractures and a brain injury&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Elynn was then life-flighted to a children's hospital in Milwaukee, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/wisconsin/index.html" id="mol-0aa87ee0-155a-11f0-85a1-67e81e2aff15"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;, for further emergency treatment. She was put into a medically induced coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, the 28-year-old mom said Vincent claimed he had accidentally dropped their daughter while trying to give her a bottle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Jordan said Vincent was arrested and she claims she was told by Child Protective Services and a detective told that he had deliberately dropped Elynn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Today Elynn is disabled and has learning difficulties, and Jordan is sharing her story to raise awareness of the permanent damage Vincent caused his daughter and the life-changing affects his actions have had on her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A little over a year later, Vincent was sentenced to 10 years in prison in April 2021 for child abuse-recklessly causing great bodily harm and neglecting a child causing great bodily harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The three-month-old had suffered multiple skull fractures and brain damage &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recalling the chain of events, Jordan said: 'I got into the house and Elynn was on the floor playing and Carl was playing in his room and my now ex-husband was sitting on the couch waiting for me to come home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I knew something was wrong. I'm looking at my children and that's when he picks up Elynn and shows me her face. The side of her face was bulging out and the back of her head was flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She was very pale and not responsive and her eyes were ticking back to the left repeatedly, she was having seizures the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I looked at my ex-husband as I was really scared. Vincent told me his version of events that happened. He told me that he was holding her and said he dropped her by accident while he was making her a bottle as she was squirming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At the time, I put myself in a protective mode as I needed to get my daughter out of there safely and to the hospital without him trying to stop me as my daughter was dying.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the criminal complaint, Children’s Wisconsin in Wauwatosa called police on because Elynn had significant head trauma.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After being questioned by CPS and a detective at the hospital, Jordan was allowed to go and see her daughter and Vincent was arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jordan said: 'They [the CPS and detective] understood immediately that I had nothing to do with it [and] the detective took me upstairs to go and see my daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I got into her room and I looked at her and puked. It was the worst image I had ever seen in my life. At that moment I was scared my daughter was going to die.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Elynn remained in the hospital for a month and was discharged February 7, 2020, but she has since had to undergo three major surgeries due to the extent of her injuries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jordan said: 'Elynn has beaten all the odds. Considering what she's been through, she is a very happy child'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jordan said the doctors weren't sure Elynn was going to survive. She was experiencing frequent seizures and had to undergo a surgery to drain fluid from around her brain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After having drains placed, Elynn began to open her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jordan said: 'When she opened her eyes, this was the first sign that I knew my daughter was going to be okay. She then continued to get stronger and stronger each day.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Elynn remained in the hospital for a month and was discharged February 7, 2020, but she has since had to undergo additional major surgeries due to the extent of her injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite 'beating the odds,' Jordan says her ex-husband's actions have completely changed her daughter's life and she's glad he's now in prison. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A court case report shows Vincent, who was 25 at the time, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, plus a five-year extended supervision, as well as probation of three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the court sentencing, Vincent was quoted by his defense attorney who said he claims he dropped Elynn as he believed this would 'maybe get her to stop crying.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Vincent (right) was sentenced to 10 years in prison in April 2021 for child abuse-recklessly causing great bodily harm and neglecting a child causing great bodily harm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jordan said her daughter couldn't walk for a long time and had to undergo leg surgery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jordan said: 'I had spoken to [Vincent] three times on the phone that day and had texted him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At this point [before I got home], I wasn't worried about him being at home on his own with the kids. He is their father and had never shown any physical signs to hurt anyone before.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Jordan said Vincent was 'a very angry person.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jordan said: 'It was almost easy for me to accept what he did because I already knew that he did it deep down on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's been my life for so many years and I have to face the consequences every day with my daughter being disabled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The brain injury was on the left side of her brain so this affected her entire right side of her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The only thing she doesn't have issues with on her right side is her hearing. She can't see her peripheral or lower peripheral vision on her right side and we are learning what she can and can't see.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jordan said Elynn has cerebral palsy and is behind her peers learning-wise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mom also said she was getting Elynn evaluated for autism because of how her injury has affected her brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jordan added: 'She couldn't walk for a long time and it was only in August last year that she had a second surgery on her leg to help her walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The excitement I had when she started being able to walk was one of the most emotional parts of my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had been waiting years for this and I didn't think she would ever walk. She is a bit unsteady on her feet but she can finally get up and play with her brother. She has a really bad limp though. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I feel I have got justice.

'I really, really regret having gotten the vaccine.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kelly, who recently launched a new podcast network called MK Media, said she received two &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pfizer/index.html" id="mol-8b29fa80-17bc-11f0-8d9a-5714ff75a0c3"&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt; jabs in 2020 and then an additional booster at the recommendation of her doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She lamented that she felt compelled to take the shots because it was difficult going out during the pandemic in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new_york/index.html" id="mol-8b2cb9a0-17bc-11f0-8d9a-5714ff75a0c3"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, where she lived at the time, without proof of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You could get the fake cards, but it was hard. I didn't know how to do it,' said Kelly, who was 50 when she was first immunized against COVID. 'So, I trusted my doctors and I did it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kelly, who went public first announced her vaccine complications on an episode of her podcast in February, said that within months of getting the booster shot, she tested positive for an autoimmune condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her rheumatologist reportedly speculated the malady could have been a result of Kelly receiving multiple jabs and then contracting COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Podcasting queen Megyn Kelly gave the Daily Mail an exclusive update on her health, after revealing a doctor's shock diagnosis that she may be suffering from a side-effect of the COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'You could get the fake cards, but it was hard.

'So, I trusted my doctors and I did it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I said [to the rheumatologist], could it be that I had the third shot - and then within a month of it, got the Omicron version,' Kelly recalled. 'And she said, yes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's an unfortunate thing. You can't undo the past,' Kelly said, conceding that there have been 'worse' outcomes experienced by other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But we were lied to,' she continued, criticizing the establishment for not warning the public about potential risks. 'It was not an informed assumption of the risk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Severe side-effects attributed to the COVID vaccine have been documented, such as allergic reactions and anaphylaxis. The Centers for Disease Control has also noted other complications, such as myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, or pericarditis, inflammation of the heart lining, as well as an autoimmune disease called Guillain-Barre Syndrome, which affects the nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of course, the COVID vaccine has also been credited with saving millions of lives globally. But there are growing, yet-unanswered questions over whether the vaccine should have been pushed so aggressively on young and healthy individuals, who were not at particular risk to adverse outcomes from the COVID virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-stage research out of Yale University also suggested a link between mRNA immunization and 'post-vaccination syndrome,' (PVS) which could cause exercise intolerance, insomnia, brain fog and dizziness. The study, published as a pre-print in February, reported that PVS could potentially contribute to autoimmunity or tissue damage – and even reawake the dormant Epstein-Barr virus in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's no question people have been hurt and even killed,' claimed Kell. 'I, for one, have learned a ton, but remain pissed off about how the whole thing was handled.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Aseem Malhotra - a cardiologist, who has faced backlash for his vaccine skepticism, previously told the Daily Mail that he was diagnosed with psoriasis, speculating that it was linked to the COVID jab. He praised Kelly in February for bringing her health scare to light on her podcast – on which he also appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The fact that one of the United States' most popular public figures only just opened up about being vaccine-injured, feeling safe to discuss it with a doctor who understands the situation, suggests that many, perhaps millions of Americans are suffering in silence,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the success of 'The Megyn Kelly Podcast,' Kelly launched her latest venture last month - MK Media, a video and audio podcast network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the first three hosts to join her network is the Daily Mail's columnist Maureen Callahan, who Kelly lauded as 'clever.' She championed Callahan's 'unique' perspectives, calling her 'a cultural maven.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's just no one better,' Kelly previously said. 'God help you if she turns her pen against you -- it's going to be so fun for the rest of us, though.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Callahan will host a show titled, 'The Nerve' which will launch this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 03:50:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNaFgxQXFEb3lBY2VSaG95eGk1eWVpNmhod0V6X1ozRTNLREQ4aE53bm45QkhzcHMzcUJEbUc4cXUxWHJaMTVjcFc3bWdWTkgwT3JZSVlONjFuLXNiVS1vN2Vrd3ZMT3BXMDQ5UVFndU1Ld3dOU0pzcnRQSUtRVDRkMzZVbWZuYWc</guid></item><item><title>糙米真的更健康吗？令人震惊的研究揭示了隐藏的风险- SciTechDaily | Is Brown Rice Really Healthier?

&lt;p&gt;MONTE VISTA, Colo. (KRDO) - Colorado Parks and Wildlife announces multiple raccoons have tested positive for canine distemper in recent weeks in Alamosa and Monte Vista.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A raccoon carcass from Monte Vista is the only confirmed case at this time, however, two raccoons from Alamosa show symptoms consistent with canine distemper, but official testing is still needed.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;CPW says animals with canine distemper often have difficulty moving and can act abnormally because of brain infections. Crusting around the eyes and/or nose is commonly observed, while other signs such as coughing, diarrhea, vomiting, and thickened paw pads tend to be less obvious. Sick animals usually do not survive. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The virus is contagious and can spread to your pet at home. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CPW recommends you get your pets vaccinated and keep them away from any wild animals. In addition to raccoons, coyotes, foxes, skunks, and other carnivores can contract the virus.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“We’ve had a number of reports, and one we submitted for testing did already come back positive for distemper,” said CPW District Wildlife Manager Tyler Cerny of Monte Vista. “In these cases, any other raccoon in the area exhibiting symptoms is presumed to be positive for canine distemper. We are continuing to see more cases.”&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;If you think your animal has canine distemper, take them to get tested for rabies. CPW says distemper cannot be distinguished from rabies without brain testing.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;When a pregnant woman had her blood sampled back in 1972, doctors discovered it was mysteriously missing a surface molecule found on all other known &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/red-blood-cells-play-a-much-greater-role-in-our-immune-system-than-we-thought"&gt;red blood cells&lt;/a&gt; at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 50 years, this strange molecular absence finally led to researchers from the UK and Israel describing a new&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/why-do-we-have-blood-types"&gt; blood group system&lt;/a&gt; in humans. In 2024, the team published their paper on the discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It represents a huge achievement, and the culmination of a long team effort, to finally establish this new blood group system and be able to offer the best care to rare, but important, patients," UK National Health Service hematologist Louise Tilley &lt;a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2024/september/blood-group.html"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; last September, after nearly 20 years of personally researching this bloody quirk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we're all more familiar with the ABO blood group system and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rh_factor_testing"&gt;Rh factor&lt;/a&gt; (that's the plus or minus part), humans actually have &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_blood_group_systems"&gt;many different blood group systems&lt;/a&gt; based on the wide variety of cell-surface proteins and sugars that coat our blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our bodies use these antigen molecules, amongst their other purposes, as identification markers to separate 'self' from potentially harmful not-selves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_140271" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140271" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/MajorBloodTypesChart642.jpg" alt="Diagram of ABO blood groups and the IgM antibodies present in each." class="size-full wp-image-140271" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/MajorBloodTypesChart642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/MajorBloodTypesChart642-600x386.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-140271" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Blood type (or blood group) is determined, in part, by the ABO blood group antigens present on red blood cells.  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="158063" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Antibodies&lt;/a&gt; in our blood plasma detect when a foreign antigen marker is present.&lt;span&gt; (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/ABO_blood_type.svg"&gt;InvictaHOG/Public Domain/Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these markers do not match up when receiving a blood transfusion, this life-saving tactic can &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482202/"&gt;cause reactions or even end up being fatal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most major blood groups were identified early in the 20th century. Many discovered since, like the Er blood system &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/discovery-of-a-new-rare-blood-type-could-save-the-lives-of-future-newborns"&gt;first described by researchers in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, only impact a small number of people. This is also the case for the new blood group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The work was difficult because the genetic cases are very rare," &lt;a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2024/september/blood-group.html"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; Tilley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_148174" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-148174" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/BloodTransfusion642.jpg" alt="A person's arm with a cannula, receiving a blood transfusion" class="size-full wp-image-148174" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/BloodTransfusion642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/BloodTransfusion642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/BloodTransfusion642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-148174" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Transfusion reactions can be severe. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAFagVIxPSo/"&gt;Africa images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research found more than 99.9 percent of people have the AnWj antigen that was missing from the 1972 patient's blood. This antigen lives on a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAL_(gene)"&gt;myelin and lymphocyte protein&lt;/a&gt;, leading the researchers to call the newly described system the MAL blood group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone has a mutated version of both copies of their &lt;em&gt;MAL&lt;/em&gt; genes, they end up with an AnWj-negative blood type, like the pregnant patient. Tilley and team identified three patients with the rare blood type that didn't have this mutation, suggesting that sometimes blood disorders can also cause the antigen to be suppressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"MAL is a very small protein with some interesting properties which made it difficult to identify and meant we needed to pursue multiple lines of investigation to accumulate the proof we needed to establish this blood group system," &lt;a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2024/september/blood-group.html"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; University of the West of England cell biologist Tim Satchwell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine they had the correct gene, after decades of research, the team inserted the normal &lt;em&gt;MAL&lt;/em&gt; gene into blood cells that were AnWj-negative. This effectively delivered the AnWj antigen to those cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MAL protein is known to play a vital role in keeping cell membranes stable and aiding in cell transport. What's more, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1537-2995.1988.28388219164.x"&gt;previous research found&lt;/a&gt; that the AnWj isn't actually present in newborn babies but appears soon after birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, all the AnWj-negative patients included in the study shared the same mutation. However, no other cell abnormalities or diseases were found to be associated with this mutation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the researchers have identified the genetic markers behind the &lt;em&gt;MAL&lt;/em&gt; mutation, patients can be tested to see if their negative MAL blood type is inherited or due to suppression, which could be a sign of another underlying medical problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These rare blood quirks can have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/discovery-of-a-new-rare-blood-type-could-save-the-lives-of-future-newborns"&gt;devastating impacts on patients&lt;/a&gt;, so the more of them we can understand, the more lives can be saved.&lt;/p&gt;

The agency counted &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;seven clusters&lt;/a&gt; that qualified as outbreaks in 2025 as of Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-31"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="RM6G65AEVVGQPDHXURLJTMBFYE"&gt;In the U.S., cases and outbreaks are frequently traced to &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-asia-measles-rates-unicef-who-report-2f888732cc297090238956986fd89cc4" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;someone who caught the disease abroad&lt;/a&gt;. It can then spread, especially in communities with low vaccination rates. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1,274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles.

The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-34"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="YXRGEA5XOFFIVCIWZPD67L6P4E"&gt;People at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak, said Scott Weaver with the Global Virus Network, an international coalition. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-35"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="6WCOW366WFBTDE6IAUUZV5KF6A"&gt;Adults with “presumptive evidence of immunity” generally don’t need measles shots now, the CDC said. Criteria include written documentation of adequate vaccination earlier in life, lab confirmation of past infection or being born before 1957, when most people were likely to be infected naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-36"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="BL4DS5N2ENBEZPDYC6JAHLWUUM"&gt;A doctor can order a lab test called an MMR titer to check your levels of measles antibodies, but experts don’t always recommend it and health insurance plans may not cover it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-37"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="QBRAP4PS55FXHH6FKJTVL26VNE"&gt;Getting another MMR shot is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="inarticle-38"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article__paragraph article__paragraph--left" id="MKK4J2YFGJEDZJ5RTR3TYOOVLM"&gt;People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don’t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective measles vaccine made from “killed” virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.

Even better: you don’t even have to clock 10,000 steps a day or be a fast walker to see a benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity seems to be the ultimate multitasking move for improved health. It’s already been linked to a wide variety of benefits, from a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6557987/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthier heart;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthier heart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10503965/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:higher-quality sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;higher-quality sleep&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1136900/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:less anxiety;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;less anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/wellness/a63655358/walk-to-live-longer-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:longer life;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;longer life&lt;/a&gt;. This new study signals that cancer prevention might deserve a spot on the list of exercise perks as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how much do you really need to walk to lower your risk of cancer? And how fast do your feet need to move? To find out exactly what this new research says about the link between exercise and cancer risk, we reached out to the lead author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the researchers did&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, scientists took data from the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UK Biobank;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt; study in which more than 85,000 adults wore devices that tracked their total daily activity, activity intensity and daily step count for a week. After an average of 5.8 years passed, 2,633 of the participants had been diagnosed with one of 13 types of cancer. The researchers then crunched all the numbers and adjusted for at least nine major cancer risk factors (such as smoking, drinking alcohol and eating red meat) to figure out how a person’s physical activity might lower their risk of developing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the study found&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who walked an average of 7,000 steps per day had a 11% lower risk of cancer than those who only took 5,000 daily steps. Those with a daily step count of 9,000 had a 16% lower risk.&lt;/strong&gt; Surprisingly, it doesn’t seem like walking more than 9,000 steps will amplify the cancer-prevention benefits much. “Above this level, it was not clear if the risk reductions linked to higher step counts were statistically different,” says &lt;a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/fellowship-experience/meet-fellows/meb/shreves-alaina" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alaina Shreves, M.S.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alaina Shreves, M.S.&lt;/a&gt;, a predoctoral fellow in the Metabolic Epidemiology Branch of the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health and the lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slow walkers, rejoice! One of the most interesting (and exciting!) findings to come out of this research is that &lt;strong&gt;you don’t have to be a power walker to lower your risk of cancer. “The pace of the steps — step intensity — seemed to be less important,” says Shreves.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does exercise help lower your risk of cancer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers aren’t exactly sure why physical activity seems to have a protective effect against cancer, but there are some theories. “For example, exercise can bring about &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11591795/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:beneficial changes in hormones;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;beneficial changes in hormones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-025-86306-2&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Ffitness%2Fa64433049%2Fstudy-walking-lower-cancer-risk%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:improve insulin sensitivity;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;improve insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6962351/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lower inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lower inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and may &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007165.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:improve immune function;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;improve immune function&lt;/a&gt;,” says Shreves. On top of that, she notes, long-term efforts to reduce sitting time in favor of increased activity have found improvements in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5999077/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:waist measurements, body fat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;waist measurements, body fat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3329818/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blood sugar and insulin levels;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;blood sugar and insulin levels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.atherosclerosis-journal.com/article/S0021-9150(25)00040-1/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7343526/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially, exercise is good for so many parts of your body that it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cancer-protecting mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this mean for future research?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get an even better idea of how exercise may help prevent cancer, “future studies should explore how physical activity affects the risk of specific types of cancer,” Shreves says. For instance, maybe it has a bigger impact on a person’s risk of say, prostate cancer than lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with most studies, more research is needed to confirm the results, but these results are promising. &lt;strong&gt;“Increasing your daily physical activity may help reduce the risk of certain cancers, regardless of the intensity of the activity,” says Shreves. “Find activities you enjoy, like walking your dog or taking a stroll, and stay active!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 21:20:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE1xRDJYU19adjZSVDdJUnBKM0pHTHFkQTM1d0Y1ajZ3eEJNRDF0Z0VRRDlpTkJNUHBPUW5lLTltdGNBNDhRRUE4VXNfcS1KdmNNd05OaVUyUWgwTXpCSHpxUEhYeEVjTUZGMExqOHgyQ0lSQWJoNVE</guid></item><item><title>医生说他们找到了一种方法来清除体内的微塑料-未来主义 | Doctors Say They’ve Found a Way to Clean the Microplastics Out of Your Body - Futurism</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE1ZNUd5Vzh4MXhnWnYxdl9SRlNQdGQyak0yem5tTXJEVGxDWUczOGRpamRWaWNmanE3YXVWajJwWTR1RkJ2cVpkaUFZYjZrRkxoX3hCZ2hxM0VwQ2Zia1VhMTE2bGFDcHU4a3BETlc0NUN4aFk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section id="incArticle" class="post-content z-50 w-full p-3 space-y-4 bg-white border lg:-mt-6 md:p-4 md:border-gray-900 lg:ml-3 lg:w-2/3 font-b text-3"&gt;&lt;div class="space-y-4 lg:space-y-0"&gt;&lt;p class="block text-xs text-gray-500 uppercase lg:hidden font-c"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Image by Peter Dazeley via Getty / Futurism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high-end medical practice is offering clients the purported service of scrubbing their blood of microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/this-startup-promises-to-clean-your-blood-of-microplastics-clarify-clinics/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Clarify Clinics CEO Yael Cohen said that her London facility's &lt;a href="https://clarifyclinics.com/what-we-do/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;bespoke blood-filtering service&lt;/a&gt; — which is otherwise known as apheresis and generally &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/apheresis" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;used for plasma donation&lt;/a&gt; or other so-called &lt;a href="https://www.saintlukeskc.org/health-library/understanding-therapeutic-plasma-exchange-tpe" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;therapeutic plasma exchange&lt;/a&gt; procedures — is so comfortable that some patients doze off during it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once it’s running, you feel nothing. It’s very comfortable," Cohen told the magazine of its Clari procedure, which costs more than $12,000 &lt;a href="https://clarifyclinics.com/book/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;per session&lt;/a&gt;. "Patients take calls, do Zooms, watch movies, sleep.

While studies in recent years have established links between microplastics and &lt;a href="https://hull-repository.worktribe.com/output/3883618/a-rapid-review-and-meta-regression-analyses-of-the-toxicological-impacts-of-microplastic-exposure-in-human-cells" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;damage to human cells&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;hearts&lt;/a&gt;, that research was all, as &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; notes, observational. Thus far, the only thing we know definitively is that these mysterious particles have been found &lt;a href="https://magazine.hms.harvard.edu/articles/microplastics-everywhere" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;nearly everywhere researchers have looked&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/24/microplastics-found-in-human-blood-for-first-time" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;our blood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://hscnews.unm.edu/news/microplastics-in-organs" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;guts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/brains-microplastics-study" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;brains&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/25/uk/microplastics-archeological-remains-study-scli-intl-scn-gbr/index.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;archaeological digs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/microplastics-found-near-everests-peak-highest-ever-detected-world-perpetual-planet" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Mount Everest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there don't appear to be any studies about the &lt;a href="https://clarifyclinics.com/science/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;effectiveness of the Clari procedure&lt;/a&gt;, there's a pretty strong body of evidence suggesting that therapeutic plasma exchange in general is a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5620780/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;safe and effective treatment&lt;/a&gt; for some &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/24197-plasmapheresis-plasma-exchange" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;autoimmune and neurological disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, the desire to get those foreign and synthetic particulates out of one's blood, and to clean one's blood in general, makes some degree of sense. According to Cohen, longevity influencer Bryan Johnson's interest in so-called "&lt;a href="https://x.com/bryan_johnson/status/1845950287032492378?lang=en" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;total plasma exchange&lt;/a&gt;" — a more extreme apheresis procedure he used to &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/bryan-johnson-young-blood-son" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;get his son's blood filtered into his own&lt;/a&gt; — where all of the body's plasma is removed and replaced with proteins and antibodies, has been a big boon for her business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He’s a big platform, and he is spending a lot of time and energy finding the things that move the needle the most," the CEO said of Johnson, a former &lt;em&gt;Futurism &lt;/em&gt;investor who's no longer involved with the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though it doesn't appear that &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; shelled out for its reporter, Matt Reynolds, to get his blood scrubbed, the journalist did get his microplastics levels tested to see what the fuss was about. In a fingerprick &lt;span&gt;sample of&lt;/span&gt; blood, Reynolds had about 190 microplastic particles per millimeter, which is apparently on the lower end of the scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pleased with the results, the reporter emailed Cohen. In response, she pointed out the stark truth: that he still has "around a million particles in [his] circulatory system!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on microplastics:  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/chewing-gum-microplastics" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chewing Gum Is Flooding Your Mouth With Microplastics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 21:15:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1ZNUd5Vzh4MXhnWnYxdl9SRlNQdGQyak0yem5tTXJEVGxDWUczOGRpamRWaWNmanE3YXVWajJwWTR1RkJ2cVpkaUFZYjZrRkxoX3hCZ2hxM0VwQ2Zia1VhMTE2bGFDcHU4a3BETlc0NUN4aFk</guid></item><item><title>末日滚动背后的科学--以及如何阻止它--《泰晤士报》 | The science behind doomscrolling — and how to stop it - The Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxQM0s4cW9lMUdHRFY4dDRSRHNkb0N0TjlOZi1fa041VjlYLVowUmczZnlFMzJucjBVX1VZbEt3QWlhRnkxQVdwTm8yNWt2ZlhKQWZocUhPSVJXV25hblJCZlo1SnFTcnh0TGVJVlVYTktraU5obzFHLUx4VWRKVHVnZXpDSnVBY1Y2SEc5NzBNdXI0OXhGM3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__ArticleContent-sc-15gvuj2-8 kuowVf"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;&lt;span class="responsive__DropCap-sc-1pktst5-1 enuiNL"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;here has been, you may have noticed, no shortage of bad news lately. Wars rumble on, markets teeter, ice caps retreat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Some of us respond in a way that feels almost instinctive — we reach for our phones, we refresh late into the night, we obsessively absorb new details. The habit has acquired a name: doomscrolling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Coined during the pandemic, when new crises seemed to unfold by the hour, the term describes the compulsion to trawl through endless bleak headlines on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;So why does bad news have such a grip on us? And how can we loosen it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A quirk of evolution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;At its core, doomscrolling appears to exploit a quirk of human psychology — our built-in bias for negativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Evolutionarily, being alive&lt;span&gt; to danger helped our ancestors survive. When early humans roamed the African savannah, those attuned to potential threats — say, the rustle of a predator in the undergrowth — stood a better chance of survival. A false positive (panicking at the wind) was preferable to a false negative (ignoring a lion).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Journalists have long understood this tendency. “If it bleeds, it leads,” runs the old newsroom adage, born of the intuition that tales of bloodshed and calamity shift more papers than good news ever could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In the digital age, the “lion in the grass” that hijacks our attention might be a lurid post about war, recession or ecological collapse. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism — an inheritable personality trait — appear particularly vulnerable, says Professor Christopher Ferguson of Stetson University. So too do those with low tolerance for uncertainty, who seek definitive answers in a chaotic world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Could bad news fuel bad health?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div id="8.3"&gt;&lt;div id="ac728863-6345-4402-b877-9b344a3cf476"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__FullWidthImg-sc-4v1r4q-4 jGJovF"&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__FullWidthCaptionContainer-sc-1io40fc-3 hADFiz"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Scientists are investigating whether doomscrolling causes chronic, low-grade inflammation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Doomscrolling resembles rumination — the repetitive, unproductive dwelling on dark thoughts. The science is still emerging, but some studies suggest a link between &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/doom-scrolling-really-does-make-you-more-depressed-study-finds-2gnxvm99d" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;heavy social media use and depression&lt;/a&gt;, anxiety and lower life satisfaction. Whether it is the scrolling that stokes low moods or that people who already feel unhappy tend to spend more time online is not clear. Many researchers suspect it is a bit of both, but if doomscrolling robs you of sleep, it is unlikely to improve your frame of mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The effects may also be physical. Dr Dan Nicolau of King’s College London, is investigating whether the compulsive consumption of bad news primes the body’s immune system for a battle that never comes. Early results suggest links between heavy social media use and elevated levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation found in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Inflammation, in small doses, can be a good thing. It helps fight infection and repair injury. If you are about to square off with a big cat, it makes sense for your body to be prepared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;However, in the modern world — sitting on a sofa, doomscrolling through disasters — this ancient defence mechanism may be misfiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Nicolau suspects that doomscrolling can lead the body to brace for physical trauma that never arrives, resulting in chronic, low-grade inflammation — the physiological equivalent of sleeping in your boots for a war that’s forever just over the horizon. This kind of smouldering, low-grade inflammation has been linked to a host of diseases, from &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/map-brain-watershed-neuroscience-mice-787r0nbpl" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; to arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Meanwhile, conditions such as depression and schizophrenia, long assumed to be purely neurological, are now thought to have inflammatory components. Whether inflammation helps cause these illnesses or merely accompanies them is unclear, but the two are increasingly hard to separate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to stop scrolling?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Addiction, says Nicolau, is often as much about anticipation as it is about consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For an alcoholic, mood-boosting hormones will surge before the first sip, he explained. Simply being exposed to certain environmental cues — say, the clink of glasses — can drive these pleasure responses close to their peak levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“In effect, addicts get much of the biochemical high without the substance,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/midlife-social-media-addict-advice-stop-vk8x79tgw" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Midlife social media addict? Here’s what to do&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If similar mechanisms underlie compulsive digital behaviours, putting distance between yourself and your phone is the obvious first step. That might mean charging it in another room or turning it off overnight. Removing shortcuts to certain apps from your home screen might help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Other options include apps that promise to make it harder for you to waste time on other apps. There are digital tools that require users to solve a maths puzzle before launching a compulsive platform like TikTok. The aim is to buy a moment of clarity — to realise: “Actually, I’d rather be doing something else.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Ferguson said: “Social media use and smartphone use should be fun for the most part. So the first thing is to notice, are you having fun?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If the answer is “no” it can be helpful to have “a cognitive plan”. Some people find it useful to have an image or a catchphrase that they can call to mind: “Something that jolts them to disengage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;His final tip? Don’t doomscroll about doomscrolling. “It’s healthy to reflect on our relationship with technology,” he said. “Just try not to panic while doing it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="paywall-portal-article-footer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxQM0s4cW9lMUdHRFY4dDRSRHNkb0N0TjlOZi1fa041VjlYLVowUmczZnlFMzJucjBVX1VZbEt3QWlhRnkxQVdwTm8yNWt2ZlhKQWZocUhPSVJXV25hblJCZlo1SnFTcnh0TGVJVlVYTktraU5obzFHLUx4VWRKVHVnZXpDSnVBY1Y2SEc5NzBNdXI0OXhGM3c</guid></item><item><title>新的研究发现，一种常见药物可以帮助预防和对抗癌症- WKRC | New study finds that a common drug could help prevent and combat cancer - WKRC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi1gJBVV95cUxQOXVCS3NRTTVvUmx5dXlaVDVvVnVFRlFFWGluYVJGQWQwTE55a2JhYXNJUjRxRUVmdkI1SHBfUTJVelU0azdGeF8yc2psbGpoZnlJQnkxNGhlWVZwVFdwY3JJSVNSRmZFeEdYWW50bDdyNHBiVjRhN3FicHhQUFE2MV9fZS1fQU9zRXJHdGE2MlF0dVVhdTZTN3hSU1JCRWdkdEdLeFMwN1ZMYk5EV0lmeG1ud1hNUnlvTktkVVFTejR1cmhJY3JfZkk3TzdvR01FSjUwQkZ4LVh1bjhrTjZJbEZQU0ZacGNXM212eUtORUhGRnRXWXNOeHRxNVp4NTJMbkRGa3o2cFRpSDY4S0pqNlNZd0xhN3lMLTRrUWVncXhsRkNabGlFVmNlRW1nUDR5ZTZqVy13WDZGQTJRaDlUNXduYU5aaWFuenZKdFNyODNlV1JnZkE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="index-module_storyColumn__EZ7G" id="js-Story-Content-0"&gt;&lt;p class="StoryTags-module_tagWrapperLine__Jfav"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="StoryText-module_storyText__FWhP"&gt;&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI (WKRC) - A new study found a correlation between regular use of a popular over the counter drug and a decreased risk in certain types of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2025.43.4_suppl.LBA125" target="_blank" title="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2025.43.4_suppl.LBA125" class="themeColorForLinks"&gt;The study&lt;/a&gt;, published in the&lt;em&gt; Journal of Clinical Oncology &lt;/em&gt;and conducted by Harvard University, examined data from over 100,000 across 30 years and found that those that took aspirin at least twice a week had a reduced risk of colorectal cancer, a benefit that was specifically increased among those who practiced bad habits like eating junk food or smoking cigarettes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;aspirin has been believed to have cancer-fighting properties since the 1980s, but the results were never concrete. Some studies suggested it was beneficial for fighting the disease, while others said it could cause more problems than it solves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the study didn't find glaring evidence that using aspirin makes you cancer-proof, it certainly suggests that those who live unhealthy lifestyles that put them at higher risk of developing cancer could greatly benefit from regularly taking the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, for those who already had colorectal cancer, taking aspirin regularly greatly decreased the likelihood of the cancer returning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The developments are exciting, but aspirin is still a medicine and should be treated as such. The drug is known to have side effects like stomach bleeding, particularly in older adults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasized that aspirin might not be the best choice for everyone, but that it certainly could be part of anyone's cancer-fighting toolkit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WKRC</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 18:11:28 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi1gJBVV95cUxQOXVCS3NRTTVvUmx5dXlaVDVvVnVFRlFFWGluYVJGQWQwTE55a2JhYXNJUjRxRUVmdkI1SHBfUTJVelU0azdGeF8yc2psbGpoZnlJQnkxNGhlWVZwVFdwY3JJSVNSRmZFeEdYWW50bDdyNHBiVjRhN3FicHhQUFE2MV9fZS1fQU9zRXJHdGE2MlF0dVVhdTZTN3hSU1JCRWdkdEdLeFMwN1ZMYk5EV0lmeG1ud1hNUnlvTktkVVFTejR1cmhJY3JfZkk3TzdvR01FSjUwQkZ4LVh1bjhrTjZJbEZQU0ZacGNXM212eUtORUhGRnRXWXNOeHRxNVp4NTJMbkRGa3o2cFRpSDY4S0pqNlNZd0xhN3lMLTRrUWVncXhsRkNabGlFVmNlRW1nUDR5ZTZqVy13WDZGQTJRaDlUNXduYU5aaWFuenZKdFNyODNlV1JnZkE</guid></item><item><title>敲指技巧可以在背景噪音下提高听力-新闻的光明面 | Finger-tapping trick can sharpen your hearing against background noise - The Brighter Side of News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxQUWQxOTFJZFJjd0ZaMGxjS0FkejVubzlPMW1jY1hQazZJZDRoZDBxbExBal9tenJlRVRDRTBtR3F0M2RuQjlINW5DVzB3UlNkVVgyb2FKX21WbTRjNi1JS2hveE5vSVdYWWNFQW1CWm9DeEtKeVFuZlc0V0d1b216cTJqb3ltaE1rbS1qajhCMlFHdk9NY3VRUlVHZ3RUSHhPRGhtRGRVcnF5TlhEZVE?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiBox-root css-a9h2n1" data-id="page-content" data-og-area="article-blocks"&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tapping your fingers to a rhythm before you enter a noisy room might seem like a strange ritual. But recent research reveals this simple act can significantly improve your ability to understand speech amidst distracting background noise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="rhythmic_tapping_and_your_brain_s_ability_to_hear"&gt;Rhythmic Tapping and Your Brain's Ability to Hear&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever struggled to follow a conversation at a crowded cafe or busy social event? French researchers discovered a practical trick: tapping your fingers rhythmically before entering these noisy settings enhances your speech comprehension. This finding builds on the idea that your &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/health/scientists-discover-brain-protein-that-can-slow-down-aging/"&gt;brain’s motor system&lt;/a&gt;—the part controlling physical movements—plays a crucial role in understanding spoken language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Schematic of an experimental trial for (A) experiment 1, (B) experiment 2 and (C) experiment 3. Each trial started with a prime after which participants heard a spoken sentence presented in noise. (CREDIT: Proceedings of the Royal Society B) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To explore this concept, researchers conducted three experiments involving young adults. Each participant listened to sentences mixed with loud &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-mobile-app-clinically-proven-to-treat-tinnitus/"&gt;background noise&lt;/a&gt;. Their task was simple: write down the words they heard. Before hearing these sentences, participants engaged in rhythmic activities, including tapping fingers at different speeds or saying words aloud. Each experiment tested a unique aspect of how rhythmic movement affects speech understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="finding_the_ideal_rhythm_for_listening"&gt;Finding the Ideal Rhythm for Listening&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first experiment, 35 participants tapped their fingers to three different speeds—slow, medium, and fast—before listening to noisy sentences. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="6" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers discovered that tapping at a medium pace—about two taps per second—led to clearer understanding of the &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/21-language-neural-text-to-speech-technology-now-works-on-smartphones/"&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt; afterward. This rate, known scientifically as the "lexical rate," aligns closely with the rhythm naturally found in human speech, approximately 1.8 beats per second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="7" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does this happen? According to the scientists, rhythmic finger-tapping helps your brain synchronize with the timing of speech patterns. This synchronization allows your brain to predict speech timing, improving its ability to filter out noise and focus on words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="physical_movement_enhances_auditory_processing"&gt;Physical Movement Enhances Auditory Processing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="8" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second experiment asked whether tapping itself mattered, or if simply listening to a rhythmic beat would have the same effect. Surprisingly, researchers found that participants who actively tapped along—whether or not they heard an external beat—had significantly better &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/scientists-discover-natural-repair-process-that-fixes-damaged-hearing/"&gt;speech comprehension&lt;/a&gt;. Merely listening passively did not provide the same benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="9" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The motor system is known to process temporal information," the researchers explained, "and moving rhythmically while listening to a melody can improve auditory processing." Their results indicate that the physical act of moving your body is crucial, rather than just hearing a rhythm. Active engagement appears to "prime" your auditory processing centers effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Experiment 1. (A) Inverse efficiency scores (IES), (B) proportion correct, and (C) correct reaction times (RT) for the no tapping (control, in beige), tapping at ~1.1 Hz (phrasal rate, in red), tapping at ~1.8 Hz (lexical rate, in blue), and tapping at ~5 Hz (syllabic rate, in brown) conditions. (CREDIT: Proceedings of the Royal Society B) &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="speaking_aloud_also_boosts_your_listening_skills"&gt;Speaking Aloud Also Boosts Your Listening Skills&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="10" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the final experiment, the researchers explored if speaking aloud before listening to noisy sentences would help comprehension. Participants said a random word aloud before hearing sentences masked by background noise. Interestingly, the spoken word did not need to relate to the sentence at all. Merely producing vocal sound beforehand enhanced the listener’s ability to &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/ai-powered-noise-canceling-headphone-lets-wearers-handpick-the-sounds-they-want-to-hear/"&gt;understand subsequent speech&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="11" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This finding emphasizes the role of active motor behavior—specifically speech production—in boosting auditory processing. Vocalizing primes the brain similarly to tapping, confirming the connection between speech production and comprehension. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="12" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists suggest this happens because speaking involves brain areas closely linked to those used for listening, creating a shared pathway for improved speech perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-h3 heading css-i66mep" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="5" data-og-block-type="core/heading" data-rawhtml="1" id="why_rhythmic_priming_works_in_your_brain"&gt;Why Rhythmic Priming Works in Your Brain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="13" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your brain continually tracks timing patterns in speech. When you tap your fingers rhythmically or vocalize words, you activate motor areas that are essential for processing temporal (time-based) information. These motor areas form part of an internal "clock" in your brain, enabling you to predict when sounds like syllables or words will occur. This rhythmic preparation enhances your brain's readiness to interpret incoming speech signals accurately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="14" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies showed that rhythmically structured speech benefits greatly from rhythmic priming. However, speech in everyday &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/are-ai-doctors-good-at-holding-medical-conversations-with-patients/"&gt;conversation&lt;/a&gt; doesn't follow strict timing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="15" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers wanted to test if rhythmic priming helps with natural, non-rhythmic speech. The positive results of their experiments strongly suggest it does, expanding potential uses for rhythmic priming beyond controlled clinical environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="3" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Experiment 2.

These findings could lead to new techniques in language education and speech therapy. For example, teachers and therapists might incorporate rhythmic tapping into exercises to aid students or patients struggling with language processing. This approach could be especially helpful for individuals with conditions that affect auditory focus, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="17" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, scientists emphasize the need for further research before applying this method widely. Participants in these initial studies were young, healthy, &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/groundbreaking-robotic-therapy-could-revolutionize-schizophrenia-treatment/"&gt;French-speaking&lt;/a&gt; adults without neurological conditions. Additional research is needed to determine if rhythmic priming effects vary with age, language background, or neurological differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="18" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the exact brain mechanisms remain theoretical. Although researchers believe motor areas connect directly with auditory pathways to create improved speech processing, this hypothesis requires confirmation through brain imaging studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="image MuiBox-root css-0" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="4" data-og-block-type="core/image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-caption css-1wisz3b" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;Experiment 3.

If you often find yourself overwhelmed by background noise, tapping your fingers or briefly vocalizing beforehand might significantly improve your listening experience. Such simple preparation can make social interactions less stressful, especially in noisy places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="20" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one of the study's authors remarked, "These findings provide evidence for the functional role of the motor system in processing the temporal dynamics of &lt;a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/researchers-discover-how-space-and-time-interact-in-the-brain/"&gt;naturalistic speech&lt;/a&gt;." This means your body movements can directly impact how well you hear and comprehend others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-paragraph paragraph css-50tlrn" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="21" data-og-block-type="core/paragraph" data-rawhtml="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, rhythmic priming could be a practical, low-cost solution to enhance communication, particularly for those who struggle in noisy environments. While further studies will expand our understanding, this research provides a compelling reason to keep your fingers tapping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="1" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;hr class="MuiDivider-root MuiDivider-fullWidth css-1pbb6nf" data-og-block-area="article-blocks" data-og-block-nth="2" data-og-block-type="core/separator" id=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Brighter Side of News</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 18:07:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxQUWQxOTFJZFJjd0ZaMGxjS0FkejVubzlPMW1jY1hQazZJZDRoZDBxbExBal9tenJlRVRDRTBtR3F0M2RuQjlINW5DVzB3UlNkVVgyb2FKX21WbTRjNi1JS2hveE5vSVdYWWNFQW1CWm9DeEtKeVFuZlc0V0d1b216cTJqb3ltaE1rbS1qajhCMlFHdk9NY3VRUlVHZ3RUSHhPRGhtRGRVcnF5TlhEZVE</guid></item><item><title>科学家第一次在实验室中生长的人牙 - 独立 | Human teeth grown in a lab for first time by scientists - The Independent</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMingFBVV95cUxQNDVEMEZURVh1cXhQRVlpLTdLc090Ty1OZzdvR19GU0tIZUF4VHNIWDJYUGRUeEs0MF9kWl90aW5BYWRIWURDT1ZqTUFVRi1ncVNjUndab2std3ZBVVpvRVJsdjRib3VVVDgtN0xOcEpQZE5uWGM0NVpueUluckNUdGsxSzFKUXVuWmFiREtVY0lhM0R0a3FQX21IcUxpZw?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sc-jbiisr-0 eWQiqu sc-jbiisr-1" id="main"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="hydrate-root sc-10wlkbs-0" data-component="SupportNSCNative" data-loading="lazy" data-theme-name="base"&gt;&lt;aside class="sc-hez36s-0 cGmNxG"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-1 iqSitv"&gt;&lt;h3 data-testid="support-nsc-title" class="sc-hez36s-2 dlmCG"&gt;Your support helps us to tell the story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-8 igdyzJ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-hez36s-13 cPkZJS"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-0 fGzMFb sc-hez36s-16 fJelbS"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-aja53j-6 fiXggt"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content-container" class="sc-aja53j-5 eSVQSf"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="dropdown-with-gradient-collapsed-content" class="sc-aja53j-4 caTeJB"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div data-testid="support-nsc-collapsed-content-tablet" class="sc-hez36s-7 blUixN"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-1uza6dc-0 cfrdoh"&gt;From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

Over time, they will weaken tooth structure, have a limited lifespan, and can lead to further decay or sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Implants require invasive surgery and a good combination of implants and alveolar bone. Both solutions are artificial and don’t fully restore natural tooth function, potentially leading to long-term complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lab-grown teeth would naturally regenerate, integrating into the jaw as real teeth. They would be stronger, longer lasting, and free from rejection risks, offering a more durable and biologically compatible solution than fillings or implants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous efforts to recreate this process in the lab had failed, as the cells were unable to communicate effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers are now exploring two possible approaches: growing a whole tooth in the lab before implanting it or placing early-stage tooth cells directly into the patient’s jaw where they could continue developing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr Zhang added: “We have different ideas to put the teeth inside the mouth. We could transplant the young tooth cells at the location of the missing tooth and let them grow inside the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboola-mid-article-thumbnails-iii" class="sc-looa6c-0 hzcAyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alternatively, we could create the whole tooth in the lab before placing it in the patient’s mouth. For both options, we need to start the very early tooth development process in the lab.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Angelova Volponi added: “As the field progresses, the integration of such innovative techniques holds the potential to revolutionise dental care, offering sustainable and effective solutions for tooth repair and regeneration.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Independent</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 18:06:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMingFBVV95cUxQNDVEMEZURVh1cXhQRVlpLTdLc090Ty1OZzdvR19GU0tIZUF4VHNIWDJYUGRUeEs0MF9kWl90aW5BYWRIWURDT1ZqTUFVRi1ncVNjUndab2std3ZBVVpvRVJsdjRib3VVVDgtN0xOcEpQZE5uWGM0NVpueUluckNUdGsxSzFKUXVuWmFiREtVY0lhM0R0a3FQX21IcUxpZw</guid></item><item><title>侵袭性脑肿瘤使温莎青少年无法行走或阅读- BBC | Aggressive brain tumour left Windsor teen unable to walk or read - BBC</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9BN3ViNlV1RjdBdU5pZkNwaVFIaXVfaDZSUnF6cFdEUmJOOUhHTDZXQlc4bkxZM1Y1LUtOc1lKQjI0RWRsT2lFbFI1N19pOGlvdWxVVGlqUnZ4d9IBX0FVX3lxTE5xUlFTYkd5MGZqcGxzOFdNZHZXUjBnaDVsd1FIV3ZNU3QxdHRURXUybjhzdE9ZN3MwTnVHSnpnVXlnSXZVcXBUMFV3YlZyU1Z2Um8yeW9mX3BUcWgtSDFj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 itISwu"&gt;'I'm living proof brain tumour research saves lives'&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 ejjhCR"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/10bd/live/435a6ba0-188d-11f0-8912-ed03ffc48ecd.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/10bd/live/435a6ba0-188d-11f0-8912-ed03ffc48ecd.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/10bd/live/435a6ba0-188d-11f0-8912-ed03ffc48ecd.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/10bd/live/435a6ba0-188d-11f0-8912-ed03ffc48ecd.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/10bd/live/435a6ba0-188d-11f0-8912-ed03ffc48ecd.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/10bd/live/435a6ba0-188d-11f0-8912-ed03ffc48ecd.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/10bd/live/435a6ba0-188d-11f0-8912-ed03ffc48ecd.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/10bd/live/435a6ba0-188d-11f0-8912-ed03ffc48ecd.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Brain Tumour Research Indi following the surgery.

A 2-ounce serving of edamame spaghetti contains around 12 grams of dietary fiber — roughly the same amount in two cups of cooked broccoli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="SZIWLAJIIFBMVEAHWZ4NRN2TCE" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Fiber is a particularly critical nutrient, one that most adults don’t get nearly enough of. Studies show that eating fiber nourishes your &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/09/20/gut-health-microbiome-best-foods/" target="_blank"&gt;gut microbiome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3399949/#:~:text=Dietary%20fiber%20(DF)%20decreases%20the,2%2C%205%2C%206)."&gt;lowers your risk&lt;/a&gt; of developing cancer, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Health authorities &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-facts-label/how-understand-and-use-nutrition-facts-label"&gt;recommend&lt;/a&gt; that adults eat at least 28 grams of fiber a day. Yet the average person&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;in the United States&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/Pdf/0910/Table_1_Nin_Gen_09.Pdf"&gt;eats far less&lt;/a&gt; than that — just 16 grams of fiber daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="32MW7T7KNRCQPBG45MNE5XUJAY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Edamame pasta is also high in protein: A serving of edamame spaghetti has about 24 grams of protein — equivalent to the amount of protein in four eggs. Edamame spaghetti is gluten-free and rich in iron, potassium and calcium, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-topic-follow-interstitial" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="1X6Q6CWV2D3AZAYKRPTZVAZFB0" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Danielle Belardo, a preventive cardiologist and nutrition expert in Los Angeles, said she eats edamame spaghetti and other legume-based pastas three to four times a week. Belardo, a vegan, said legume pastas provide “an excellent combination of high fiber and high protein in one convenient, whole-food package.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="9262T0CGVT2TH0M5CBQQ7ZVVG4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Belardo said she recommends legume pastas to her patients because the pastas are convenient, filling, and can improve blood pressure and cholesterol levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="IX3ZS75VLBAQXLUKCQVHOQ4AYA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;But cooking with legume pastas — and making them taste good — isn’t the same as cooking with traditional varieties. To help you make the most out of legume pastas, we analyzed their nutritional benefits and experimented with several recipes for edamame pasta in the kitchen. Here’s what we learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="KB6E56P55VD3JLOOB5W5NC22OE" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="KB6E56P55VD3JLOOB5W5NC22OE"&gt;Legume pastas vs. traditional pastas&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="D7EDVNMGABGKLHBW54X2GCH2MQ" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Many legume pastas contain just one ingredient: dried beans or lentils that are ground into flour and combined with water to make dough, which is then shaped into spaghetti, penne, rotini and other types of pasta. Because legumes are high in protein and fiber, so too is legume pasta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="EWXQSQZ7XNCCDEYYMIY6BLQUWY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Traditional dried pasta is made from wheat kernels that have had their outer layers removed, a process called refining. That’s important because these parts of the wheat contain most of its fiber and vitamins. The part that’s left behind and used to make the pasta is the starchy endosperm, which is why traditional pasta is low in fiber and full of fast-digesting carbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="4FFX6TGQ5D0C996NB8Q85WWEZW" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Some pastas are made from whole wheat, meaning they’re made from the whole grain. Whole wheat pasta contains more fiber and other nutrients than traditional white pasta. But legume pastas typically contain more protein and fiber than whole wheat pasta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="ORAQ2ZFRYRHWJEFG3FTO6HKFL4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;In terms of flavor, legume pastas taste earthier and nuttier than conventional pasta, making them reminiscent of whole wheat noodles. Texture-wise, they’re bouncier and seem akin to soba noodles, making them particularly well-suited to Asian flavors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-header" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;h3 class="wpds-c-iLVUUd wpds-c-iLVUUd-bALvEi-isCenteredLayout-false" data-qa="article-header" data-contentid="44GK72A92T313E87UX3BAEDRKG" data-apitype="header" level="2" id="44GK72A92T313E87UX3BAEDRKG"&gt;The health benefits of legume pastas&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ul class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="JDIP5AGAFZAYRMY42O7RGHU2OI" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fiber&lt;/b&gt;: Legume pastas made from edamame, black beans, lupine beans and red lentils are especially high in fiber. Scientists think there are a number of reasons fiber has been linked to &lt;a href="http://thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2818%2931809-9/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;better health outcomes&lt;/a&gt;. Fiber &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/09/20/gut-health-microbiome-best-foods/"&gt;promotes the growth&lt;/a&gt; of healthy microbes in your gut and prompts them to produce compounds like short chain fatty acids, which lower inflammation. These microbes also stimulate the release of GLP-1, a hormone that promotes satiety and helps to lower blood sugar levels. This is the same hormone that drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy are designed to mimic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Low glycemic&lt;/b&gt;: Because legume pastas are high in fiber and relatively low in carbs, they have a lower glycemic impact than regular pasta. That means they’re digested more slowly and are less likely to spike your blood sugar levels. That can translate to metabolic health benefits. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10746079/"&gt;Studies have found&lt;/a&gt; that eating low-glycemic foods can improve blood sugar control and help people lose weight and body fat. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10746079/"&gt;Some studies&lt;/a&gt; suggest that it can also reduce blood pressure and inflammation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Plant protein&lt;/b&gt;: Belardo especially likes that legume pastas are rich in plant protein. In one study published in the &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32699048/" target="_blank"&gt;journal BMJ&lt;/a&gt;, scientists analyzed data on over 715,000 people who were followed for up to 32 years. They found that people who consumed a lot of plant protein were 8 percent less likely to die during the study period compared with people who ate very little plant protein.

To find out, we experimented with several approaches to the sauce, with the goal of finding something punchy enough to stand up to the spaghetti — or perhaps even overpower it to satisfy anyone who might find the pasta to be an acquired taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="X634ZJGPHFENVNKDJDR5DHJQU4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Ultimately, we found a winner in a vibrant sauce made with whole peas, feta and pistachios. The dish clocks in at 22 grams of fiber (more than three-quarters of a day’s worth) and 39 grams of protein — and goes down easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="AXPDDFUPUBBWNFLJ6FNTWNYQZ4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Here are tips for cooking with edamame and other legume pastas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-list" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;ol class="PJLV font--article-body font-copy gray-darkest mt-0 mr-lg ml-lg mb-md list" data-contentid="2HFTMV2KORBADFQXIAYVHKKDZY" data-apitype="list"&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you’re new to legume pastas, then start off slow.&lt;/b&gt; Start with a 2-ounce serving of legume pasta once a week. If you want to eat it more often, then gradually increase the amount to two or more servings per week over the ensuing weeks. Experts say that for some people, suddenly increasing the amount of fiber in your diet — from legume pastas or any other fiber-rich foods — could lead to some initial gastrointestinal discomfort. But over time that should go away as your body adjusts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be sure to follow the package instructions for cooking. &lt;/b&gt;One brand of edamame spaghetti, for instance, calls for you to boil it for just 5 or 6 minutes, while another suggests adding it to boiling water, turning off the heat and letting the pasta gently soak until tender.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Remember the sauce adds fiber, too. &lt;/b&gt;In our experiments in the kitchen, adding ingredients such as artichoke hearts, navy beans and mustard greens tasted good. But the fiber overload was simply too much and felt heavy going down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pick the legume pasta that tastes best to you. &lt;/b&gt;Some have different flavors and textures than others, so you should try a few and see which ones you like. A good starting point for most people is chickpea or lentil pasta, since their textures tend to be the most similar to traditional wheat pasta, Belardo said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="wpds-c-gtqFlz"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pair the pasta with punchy flavors. &lt;/b&gt;Garlicky, lemony and maybe spicy flavors can stand up to the pasta’s earthy taste. Belardo said she likes eating red lentil pasta with arugula pesto, walnuts and chia seeds. She also likes edamame spaghetti tossed with lemon tahini sauce and roasted vegetables, and black bean spaghetti with sautéed mushrooms and tomato sauce. Another smart option would be to employ a spicy peanut sauce with the edamame spaghetti, perhaps using it instead of the soba noodles in &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/recipes/spicy-peanut-soba-noodles-green-beans/" target="_blank"&gt;this recipe&lt;/a&gt; from The Post’s Dinner in Minutes columnist, Aaron Hutcherson.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-apitype="text" data-contentid="HGTIXJI4XFFF3IDH6X7B6VHUW4" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have a question about healthy eating?

Moreover, while women are as likely to have a heart attack as men, they are more likely to die from one. And this is often attributed to delayed diagnosis and undertreatment of CVD in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But why so?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to know more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The age factor:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While heart attacks are more common in older adults, there's a growing concern about their incidence in younger women, particularly those between 20 and 40. The American Heart Association notes that heart disease is the leading cause of death for women, and heart attacks can occur at younger ages than traditionally thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why so?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Increased incidence:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Research suggests that heart attacks are becoming more prevalent in younger women, with some studies showing a rise in hospitalizations for heart attacks among those under 55. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD):&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; SCAD, a tear in the artery wall, is a common cause of heart attacks in younger women, often affecting those with no other risk factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Underlying conditions:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Young women may be more likely to have underlying conditions like hypertension, diabetes, or chronic kidney disease that increase their risk of heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Subtle symptoms:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Women may experience less common or more subtle heart attack symptoms compared to men, potentially leading to delays in seeking medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, older women are at increased risk for heart attacks due to a combination of factors, including the decline in estrogen after menopause, which can increase the risk of heart disease. Additionally, women tend to experience heart attacks at an older age compared to men, and they may be more prone to undiagnosed or untreated risk factors like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes. Furthermore, women may have different heart attack symptoms than men, which can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here's a more detailed look:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Estrogen Decline:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before menopause, estrogen helps protect women from heart disease. After menopause, estrogen levels drop, increasing the risk of heart disease and heart attacks. This decline in estrogen can also lead to changes in the blood vessels, making it easier for plaque to build up and for blood clots to form, increasing the risk of a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Age and Increased Risk:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Women typically experience heart attacks at an older age compared to men. Age itself is an independent risk factor for heart disease, and the risk increases with age. This means that older women are at a higher risk of developing heart disease and experiencing a heart attack due to age-related changes in the heart and blood vessels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Undiagnosed or Untreated Risk Factors:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Women may be more likely to have underlying risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes, that go undiagnosed or untreated. This can lead to more severe heart attacks and increased health problems after a heart attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Different Symptoms and Diagnosis:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Women may experience different symptoms of a heart attack than men, such as shortness of breath, nausea, or dizziness, which can be less obvious and delay diagnosis. This can lead to delayed treatment and potentially worse outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mortality rate in women due to heart attack:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women may experience higher mortality rates after a heart attack compared to men due to a combination of factors, including delayed diagnosis, different symptoms, and unique risk factors. Women are often diagnosed later than men, and their heart attack symptoms can be less distinct, leading to a delayed response. Additionally, women may have higher rates of certain conditions like high blood pressure and diabetes, which can contribute to more severe heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reasons might be as such:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Delayed Diagnosis:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Women are more likely to experience atypical heart attack symptoms, such as nausea, dizziness, or fatigue, which can be misinterpreted or dismissed, leading to delayed diagnosis and treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Different Symptoms:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; While chest pain is a common symptom of heart attack in both men and women, women are more likely to experience other symptoms like pain in the neck, jaw, or back, which can be less recognized as heart attack related. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Unique Risk Factors:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hormonal changes, particularly after menopause, can increase a woman's risk for heart disease. Additionally, pregnancy-related complications like high blood pressure and gestational diabetes can also elevate a woman's risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Underrepresentation in Research:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Historically, women have been underrepresented in cardiovascular research, leading to a lack of specific knowledge about heart attack risks and outcomes in women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Treatments and Procedures:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Women are sometimes less likely to receive the same treatments and procedures as men, such as cardiac catheterization, potentially contributing to poorer outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Social Determinants:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Factors like stress, lack of support, and depression can also contribute to poorer outcomes for women after a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="81"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Early symptoms of heart disease in women:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early symptoms of heart disease in women can be subtle and may include fatigue, shortness of breath, nausea, and dizziness, or even pain in the neck, jaw, or upper back. Women may also experience atypical symptoms like indigestion or heartburn, which are less commonly associated with heart problems in men. Recognizing these early signs is crucial for timely diagnosis and treatment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More detailed information about early symptoms:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Fatigue:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Women may experience unusual fatigue, even after sufficient rest, which can be a significant early symptom of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Shortness of breath:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shortness of breath, even during light activities, can be an indicator of heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Nausea and Vomiting:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some women may experience nausea or vomiting during a heart attack, which can be a more common symptom in women than in men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Dizziness and Lightheadedness:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting can also be early symptoms of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Pain or Discomfort in the Chest:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; While chest pain is a common symptom of heart disease, women may experience a more subtle or dull ache or discomfort, rather than the severe pain often associated with heart attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Pain in the Neck, Jaw, or Upper Back:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some women experience pain or discomfort in the neck, jaw, or upper back, which can be a sign of heart disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Indigestion and Heartburn:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; These gastrointestinal symptoms may be a less obvious sign of heart disease in women, but should be considered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Sweating:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unexplained sweating, especially cold sweats, can also be a symptom of heart disease or a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Heart Attack Warning Signs That Women May Confuse With Menopause Symptoms&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 16:20:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>长寿专家说，一种食物占居住在100的人的饮食量的90％ - 萨里生活 | Long-life expert says one food makes up 90 per cent of diet for people living to 100 - Surrey Live</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMif0FVX3lxTE41Nkg2eTZLQXphN0R4eGNfVXg2ODIyekZHdmtZWi1MczNQZkYzZ1l1N1RSTzYwZ3VtWmtvakZ2TUluRG55QmRMWkZMQXNSSXFSZ3VjejRTUHpXOXhTZW9EQS1vQmg5bWJRa2ttX0NEU2NBdWhNR3hyNmRXNXdQdW_SAYQBQVVfeXFMUEQxei1Ycl9oc2oxdEpfNUhaVnVEOGVFaXhKd0drbnpzd1BHYmp2VGVKYlNpVUJTS3dVVXhlQW5FYzlhRVl5T0RIM3hNWWlzXzhtX3NVVDdEanctc2lQOFFOM3FLNlpSRXJxQkk3cnQzMVhVN1NnOEhuTzROeHNxRnJwbEx2?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An expert specialising in long life says that one food makes up about 90 per cent of the diet for people hitting 100.

Not only do people live longer there, but they also tend to be healthier as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The five blue zones around the world are Okinawa (Japan), Ikaria (Greece), Loma Linda (USA), Sardinia (Italy), and Nicoya (Costa Rica).

They also provide antioxidants that combat free radicals, reducing the risk of chronic diseases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"People in the longest-living communities eat 90 per cent whole-food, plant-based," Buettner said. "Longevity isn’t luck — it’s lifestyle."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Surrey Live</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 16:05:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMif0FVX3lxTE41Nkg2eTZLQXphN0R4eGNfVXg2ODIyekZHdmtZWi1MczNQZkYzZ1l1N1RSTzYwZ3VtWmtvakZ2TUluRG55QmRMWkZMQXNSSXFSZ3VjejRTUHpXOXhTZW9EQS1vQmg5bWJRa2ttX0NEU2NBdWhNR3hyNmRXNXdQdW8</guid></item><item><title>您必须避免使用的7种具有高胆固醇水平的食物-NDTV食物 | 7 Foods With High Cholesterol Levels You Must Avoid - NDTV Food</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimwFBVV95cUxPRVctQTN6OWxTNkhCZXQwY1pjLXVpRlR0UDRYM2ZnUFBsZzYwWXY1ME9pM2tkcHRiMHE3cnpOLVdDdUd5TTR4SzNaRHowWjJXS2h3SUhPN3hScXJJakh5ekVkQWhycERrLVBPTkRxRjN2WHFFejFZakNITkhMaFJGNGNWOFB0ZkI5U1BNMW40X19tU3FDTjJuYlA4RdIBmwFBVV95cUxPRVctQTN6OWxTNkhCZXQwY1pjLXVpRlR0UDRYM2ZnUFBsZzYwWXY1ME9pM2tkcHRiMHE3cnpOLVdDdUd5TTR4SzNaRHowWjJXS2h3SUhPN3hScXJJakh5ekVkQWhycERrLVBPTkRxRjN2WHFFejFZakNITkhMaFJGNGNWOFB0ZkI5U1BNMW40X19tU3FDTjJuYlA4RQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="letterbox"&gt;  &lt;h1 class="gbdix pa gbdix-a"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Processed Meats&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p class="ddwjg pa ddwjg-a"&gt;Sausages, bacon, and salami contain high cholesterol and unhealthy fats, increasing the risk of heart disease and high blood pressure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="jcofg pa"&gt;Heading 2&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p class="pkodr pa"&gt;Image Credit: Pexels&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NDTV Food</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 16:01:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMimwFBVV95cUxPRVctQTN6OWxTNkhCZXQwY1pjLXVpRlR0UDRYM2ZnUFBsZzYwWXY1ME9pM2tkcHRiMHE3cnpOLVdDdUd5TTR4SzNaRHowWjJXS2h3SUhPN3hScXJJakh5ekVkQWhycERrLVBPTkRxRjN2WHFFejFZakNITkhMaFJGNGNWOFB0ZkI5U1BNMW40X19tU3FDTjJuYlA4RdIBmwFBVV95cUxPRVctQTN6OWxTNkhCZXQwY1pjLXVpRlR0UDRYM2ZnUFBsZzYwWXY1ME9pM2tkcHRiMHE3cnpOLVdDdUd5TTR4SzNaRHowWjJXS2h3SUhPN3hScXJJakh5ekVkQWhycERrLVBPTkRxRjN2WHFFejFZakNITkhMaFJGNGNWOFB0ZkI5U1BNMW40X19tU3FDTjJuYlA4RQ</guid></item><item><title>美容牙医推荐的最佳牙齿美白套装- Vogue | The Best Teeth Whitening Kits, According to Cosmetic Dentists - Vogue</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZkFVX3lxTE4yZHZBNDNvamR6bkpfZzgxdTVnbXJlWFoxYW9YbVlDZVB6bXZ5cnRYWGpZb1hLWDBVaWZfajJtVmZGVE1xMkpVM190SGJmUmwyb1l5LWdiNTB5RS1ERUtRMk9xZ1p3QQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body__inner-container"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same way you need special glasses to look at a solar eclipse, that’s how blindingly white I want my teeth to be. Obviously, this is a lofty goal, but I’ve been working toward it by experimenting with the best teeth whitening kits. This isn’t my first foray into teeth whitening. As a teen fresh out of braces, I tried multiple in-office treatments. Since then, I’ve tested everything from overnight whitening strips to charcoal &lt;a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-whitening-toothpaste" target="_blank"&gt;toothpaste&lt;/a&gt; that stained my sink an unfortunate shade of black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vogue&lt;/em&gt;’s Favorite Teeth Whitening Kits:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, at-home teeth whitening kits have worked the best for both my budget and lifestyle. Unlike strips, these usually combine technology, like LED lights, with active ingredients like hydrogen peroxide and carbamide peroxide that do the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; whitening. And fortunately, today’s top at-home teeth whitening kits can target both surface stains and deeper discoloration from coffee, tea, wine, soda, and tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, we asked three board-certified cosmetic dentists to break down how these whitening kits work, what makes teeth look whiter, how to choose the right one for your needs, and eight options worth trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;In This Story:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Overall:&lt;/strong&gt; Colgate Optic White ComfortFit Teeth Whitening Kit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn hxReXn callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-hDFFwy jmjUSU product-embed" data-item='{"ctaHref":"https://cna.st/p/3ML3AxBWphqb6VvhSbUGhMzPztpb48Vy9n6Kc6VRqNx6cLnLbXkM2rs5ruFanS8uebHr1x5UbMhQ3vv4XHeqtT16CzR2hNPJLverMuCFyPBZ1n5Tk6hbjKdkSibi9fdhYx8VExeB8wk5LChGiXiyQs2zX3V82JY9PRujcuB3jVCyX3Mit5Ysn82xiGaPnXbxwawSq1TyxyTaM35Xsdv7gdfW67gAGTHEU7qJ6igEynhzCPz8Hoyy9tx5Pa85iZwbgLH47EAbDJs4VTexDZExgzYHn4tLUCWYcUWHSn","dangerousDek":"","productBrand":"Colgate","dangerousHed":"White ComfortFit Teeth Whitening Kit","embedSize":null,"isFirstProduct":true,"isSponsored":false,"offerRetailer":"AMAZON","offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Colgate-ComfortFit-Whitening-Enamel-Android/dp/B0B9HVCMBB/","contentType":"product","productId":"67f7eca0f498a14678196078","productOfferVariation":"PriceOutsideCenter","showOfferUrl":false,"showPriceOnButton":true,"showAffiliateDisclaimerOnFirstProduct":false,"dangerousCredit":null,"showLocalisedOffers":true,"isUpcEnabled":true,"showClampedProductDescription":true,"productDescriptionLineLength":5,"hasReadMoreFeature":false,"index":0,"hasAffiliateLinkDisabled":false,"isMobileView":false,"hasMultipleImageSupport":true,"showImageCreditText":false,"showMultipleImageCount":4,"hasProsConsFeature":false,"hasRatingFeature":false,"pros":[],"cons":[],"rating":"","isPrimeExclusive":false,"shouldUseAmazonPrimeDayLiveAPIData":true,"id":"67f7eca0f498a14678196078","brand":{"name":"Colgate"},"offers":[{"offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Colgate-ComfortFit-Whitening-Enamel-Android/dp/B0B9HVCMBB/","price":"$50","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/3ML3AxBWphqb6VvhSbUGhMzPztpb48Vy9n6Kc6VRqNx6cLnLbXkM2rs5ruFanS8uebHr1x5UbMhQ3vv4XHeqtT16CzR2hNPJLverMuCFyPBZ1n5Tk6hbjKdkSibi9fdhYx8VExeB8wk5LChGiXiyQs2zX3V82JY9PRujcuB3jVCyX3Mit5Ysn82xiGaPnXbxwawSq1TyxyTaM35Xsdv7gdfW67gAGTHEU7qJ6igEynhzCPz8Hoyy9tx5Pa85iZwbgLH47EAbDJs4VTexDZExgzYHn4tLUCWYcUWHSn","reducedPrice":"$30","sellerName":"AMAZON","countryCode":"US"}],"component":"unified_product_card","hasMultipleImage":false,"componentType":true,"showProsConsData":false,"showBadge":false,"cneIds":[]}'&gt;&lt;div type="embed" class="UnifiedProductCardWrapper-iFnytN gDPsY"&gt;&lt;p class="UnifiedProductCardObject-fQsetj ixCaho"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-bhBobV hTeQWy"&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardBrandName-kBReJq iUEiRd fUKWbF kWVbwh upc-brandName"&gt;Colgate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardNameWrapper-fHyUwm iUEiRd eXWQIZ cBvqln"&gt;&lt;p id="upc_67f7eca0f498a14678196078" type="embed" class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardName-jnQGSN iUEiRd qICFz vJQvI"&gt;White ComfortFit Teeth Whitening Kit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It&lt;/strong&gt;: There’s a level of trust that comes with using Colgate’s dental products, one built over years of growing up with the brand. But just like you, the brand has evolved and now offers whitening kits as part of its repertoire. Cosmetic dentist Dr. Anjali Rajpal explains that Colgate’s whitening kit uses a 9% hydrogen peroxide-based gel, which is a reasonably strong concentration, paired with a flexible LED tray that offers a more tech-forward and comfortable fit. The trays also have a built-in tech element, as each one plugs directly into your iPhone or Android device for power. “It is a little pricier and requires consistent use, but it should generate good results,” she says. The brand recommends using the system for 10 days in a row for best results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;: Hydrogen peroxide&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type&lt;/strong&gt;: LED whitening light, teeth whitening pen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Treatments Included&lt;/strong&gt;: N/A&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Use&lt;/strong&gt;: Apply a thin layer of the whitening serum to your teeth, then use the LED device to illuminate your smile for 10 minutes. The brand recommends leaving the serum on overnight, but you can also brush your teeth to remove the dried formula sooner.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Whitening Strips:&lt;/strong&gt; Crest 3D Whitestrips With Light&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn jlHbNf callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-hDFFwy jmjUSU product-embed" data-item='{"ctaHref":"https://cna.st/p/2axRRXrp1mKAPWK3dnxyrGQvPs4sCEqRUhYf3iu7uPEviegms8mdfnCpMpXa4VgpMbJ9bm6rbfAhxqiPd4kaY5usjgnxD9PyEtRKwymGcjEXZU1SK4NgTCqSX8w1CQuXJofdQeSskS4qHnJAPGw7aX4nTHKHyhquEw3Dz3Khn2ZM494auCtBHYAoWvvn9fB8tTRHUsqsQBAZ3WgzxZcUNXL9wvUUuwQmagTu1jZMWtxAgGnP1gExoo6UmHguoCKqN9ACbbBZecm6BYcDJfS2i6KwnomoUZaRj4","dangerousDek":"","productBrand":"Crest","dangerousHed":"3D Whitestrips with Light","embedSize":null,"isFirstProduct":false,"isSponsored":false,"offerRetailer":"AMAZON","offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Crest-White-Whitestrips-Whitening-Strips/dp/B01M63SQTI/","contentType":"product","productId":"67f7eca083e01f30402c0a76","productOfferVariation":"PriceOutsideCenter","showOfferUrl":false,"showPriceOnButton":true,"showAffiliateDisclaimerOnFirstProduct":false,"dangerousCredit":null,"showLocalisedOffers":true,"isUpcEnabled":true,"showClampedProductDescription":true,"productDescriptionLineLength":5,"hasReadMoreFeature":false,"index":1,"hasAffiliateLinkDisabled":false,"isMobileView":false,"hasMultipleImageSupport":true,"showImageCreditText":false,"showMultipleImageCount":4,"hasProsConsFeature":false,"hasRatingFeature":false,"pros":[],"cons":[],"rating":"","isPrimeExclusive":false,"shouldUseAmazonPrimeDayLiveAPIData":true,"id":"67f7eca083e01f30402c0a76","brand":{"name":"Crest"},"offers":[{"offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/Crest-White-Whitestrips-Whitening-Strips/dp/B01M63SQTI/","price":"$70","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/2axRRXrp1mKAPWK3dnxyrGQvPs4sCEqRUhYf3iu7uPEviegms8mdfnCpMpXa4VgpMbJ9bm6rbfAhxqiPd4kaY5usjgnxD9PyEtRKwymGcjEXZU1SK4NgTCqSX8w1CQuXJofdQeSskS4qHnJAPGw7aX4nTHKHyhquEw3Dz3Khn2ZM494auCtBHYAoWvvn9fB8tTRHUsqsQBAZ3WgzxZcUNXL9wvUUuwQmagTu1jZMWtxAgGnP1gExoo6UmHguoCKqN9ACbbBZecm6BYcDJfS2i6KwnomoUZaRj4","sellerName":"AMAZON","countryCode":"US","reducedPrice":""}],"component":"unified_product_card","hasMultipleImage":false,"componentType":true,"showProsConsData":false,"showBadge":false,"cneIds":[]}'&gt;&lt;div type="embed" class="UnifiedProductCardWrapper-iFnytN gDPsY"&gt;&lt;p class="UnifiedProductCardObject-fQsetj ixCaho"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-bhBobV hTeQWy"&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardBrandName-kBReJq iUEiRd fUKWbF kWVbwh upc-brandName"&gt;Crest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardNameWrapper-fHyUwm iUEiRd eXWQIZ cBvqln"&gt;&lt;p id="upc_67f7eca083e01f30402c0a76" type="embed" class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardName-jnQGSN iUEiRd qICFz vJQvI"&gt;3D Whitestrips with Light&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It&lt;/strong&gt;: For those more comfortable with strips than trays, this whitening kit from Crest is both convenient and easy to use. Cosmetic dentist Dr. Jaskaren Randhawa explains that it combines a peroxide-based gel containing 10% hydrogen peroxide with an LED light to enhance the whitening process. “A higher at-home concentration of hydrogen peroxide ensures a more effective and noticeable outcome,” she says. “From a clinical perspective, this is a well-balanced product that can safely whiten teeth over time, making it a reliable at-home option. The addition of light accelerates the chemical breakdown of stains, providing faster results compared to traditional strips.” However, Dr. Rajpal notes that they may cause some tooth sensitivity, so keep that in mind if you tend to lean on the sensitive side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;: Hydrogen peroxide&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type&lt;/strong&gt;: Whitening strips, LED light&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Treatments Included&lt;/strong&gt;: 10 treatments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Use&lt;/strong&gt;: Apply the whitening strips to your upper and lower teeth once a day for one hour. After removing the strips, place the light on both the upper and lower teeth until it turns off automatically.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for Strengthening:&lt;/strong&gt; Snow Teeth Whitening Kit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It&lt;/strong&gt;: For teeth as white as snow, Dr. Randhawa recommends this kit for its ability to “effectively whiten teeth while strengthening and repairing enamel.” She explains that it contains hydroxyapatite to remineralize, rebuild, and strengthen enamel, along with potassium nitrate, which helps reduce tooth sensitivity. “The whitening serum contains a 6% hydrogen peroxide concentration, which breaks down stains, and the formula is sulfate-free,” she adds. And for those who often deal with zingers, she reassures: “This combination of active ingredients whitens teeth while also maintaining enamel health and minimizing sensitivity.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;: Hydrogen peroxide, carbamide peroxide&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type&lt;/strong&gt;: LED whitening mouthpiece, teeth whitening pen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Treatments Included&lt;/strong&gt;: N/A&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Use&lt;/strong&gt;: Brush your teeth, apply the Diamond Serum using the wand, then wear the LED mouthpiece for 10 to 30 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for Sensitive Teeth:&lt;/strong&gt; Moon The Teeth Whitening Device System&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn jlHbNf callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-hDFFwy jmjUSU product-embed" data-item='{"ctaHref":"https://cna.st/p/F4467UzwXghrU5ph4K6DQmB4RqkwuZnxcTmTXbQYi3FecjKPhGRpLtNRFBihvWATwxvwDSnn54ZUU5rjvLoGmZhJTFyZ4x3CfbWskYRvZSADtKC8rzBdncEEaDyypBEoERdPbYvwJUx3SUfHEZ6VHTAjU9xAviGsGrXjExqKPUeRziTj3x7uGTAjq6ae9JoJGzpPma5kqgZ1GfneHZU7BoqZjtTksFLJTj59xjEibjCgFkdroStaokqV6p2JmRSybFfmEQgpSWsRyfQkZVTtRo3Z4tY6","dangerousDek":"","productBrand":"","dangerousHed":"The Teeth Whitening Device System","embedSize":null,"isFirstProduct":false,"isSponsored":false,"offerRetailer":"NORDSTROM","offerUrl":"https://www.nordstrom.com/s/moon-the-teeth-whitening-device-system/7459709","contentType":"product","productId":"67f7eca14260c27ad9b268e0","productOfferVariation":"PriceOutsideCenter","showOfferUrl":false,"showPriceOnButton":true,"showAffiliateDisclaimerOnFirstProduct":false,"dangerousCredit":null,"showLocalisedOffers":true,"isUpcEnabled":true,"showClampedProductDescription":true,"productDescriptionLineLength":5,"hasReadMoreFeature":false,"index":3,"hasAffiliateLinkDisabled":false,"isMobileView":false,"hasMultipleImageSupport":true,"showImageCreditText":false,"showMultipleImageCount":4,"hasProsConsFeature":false,"hasRatingFeature":false,"pros":[],"cons":[],"rating":"","isPrimeExclusive":false,"shouldUseAmazonPrimeDayLiveAPIData":true,"id":"67f7eca14260c27ad9b268e0","brand":{"name":""},"offers":[{"offerUrl":"https://www.nordstrom.com/s/moon-the-teeth-whitening-device-system/7459709","price":"$90","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/F4467UzwXghrU5ph4K6DQmB4RqkwuZnxcTmTXbQYi3FecjKPhGRpLtNRFBihvWATwxvwDSnn54ZUU5rjvLoGmZhJTFyZ4x3CfbWskYRvZSADtKC8rzBdncEEaDyypBEoERdPbYvwJUx3SUfHEZ6VHTAjU9xAviGsGrXjExqKPUeRziTj3x7uGTAjq6ae9JoJGzpPma5kqgZ1GfneHZU7BoqZjtTksFLJTj59xjEibjCgFkdroStaokqV6p2JmRSybFfmEQgpSWsRyfQkZVTtRo3Z4tY6","sellerName":"NORDSTROM","countryCode":"US","reducedPrice":""}],"component":"unified_product_card","hasMultipleImage":false,"componentType":true,"showProsConsData":false,"showBadge":false,"cneIds":[]}'&gt;&lt;div type="embed" class="UnifiedProductCardWrapper-iFnytN gDPsY"&gt;&lt;p class="UnifiedProductCardObject-fQsetj ixCaho"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-bhBobV hTeQWy"&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardBrandName-kBReJq iUEiRd fUKWbF kWVbwh upc-brandName"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardNameWrapper-fHyUwm iUEiRd eXWQIZ cBvqln"&gt;&lt;p id="upc_67f7eca14260c27ad9b268e0" type="embed" class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardName-jnQGSN iUEiRd qICFz vJQvI"&gt;The Teeth Whitening Device System&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It&lt;/strong&gt;: For a whitening system that is free from potentially harmful ingredients such as SLS, SLES, parabens, artificial flavors, and animal by-products, consider Moon. Dr. Randhawa explains that the system uses a hydrogen peroxide–based gel with a 6% concentration, combined with LED light technology to help accelerate the whitening process. So no matter how much coffee or red wine you’ve had over the years, “this combination effectively targets surface stains,” she says. However, Dr. Rajpal notes that it has limited clinical proof compared to other kits, so it may not deliver results as dramatically or as quickly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;: Hydrogen peroxide&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type&lt;/strong&gt;: Whitening strips, LED whitening mouthpiece&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Treatments Included&lt;/strong&gt;: 56 dissolvable strips&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Use&lt;/strong&gt;: Apply the whitening strips to your upper and lower teeth, then insert the mouthpiece and press the button to turn it on. It will automatically turn off after five minutes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for Surface Stains:&lt;/strong&gt; Auraglow Teeth Whitening Kit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It&lt;/strong&gt;: This kit strikes the perfect balance between affordability and effectiveness. It uses a 35% carbamide peroxide-based gel in tandem with an LED light to accelerate the whitening process. While the results may not be instant, Dr. Rajpal notes that it “delivers results gradually,” making it a reliable pick for those who prefer a gentler approach.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;: Carbamide peroxide&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type&lt;/strong&gt;: Carbamide peroxide gel syringe, LED whitening mouthpiece&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Treatments Included&lt;/strong&gt;: 20&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Use&lt;/strong&gt;: After brushing your teeth and charging the LED whitening light, apply a thin line of gel to the top and bottom of the tray. Insert the tray, tap the logo to turn it on, and wear the device for 30 minutes for best results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best for Deep Discoloration:&lt;/strong&gt; iSmile Teeth Whitening Kit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It&lt;/strong&gt;: If you’re “so over” strips, Dr. Wagner says LED mouthpieces like this one, which keep the whitening agent in place, often perform better. “Think about your lifestyle and your level of sensitivity. If you have 10 to 15 minutes a day and want a deeper, all-over brightening, something like the iSmile LED tray system can be a great fit.” He explains that this kit combines a carbamide peroxide gel with a light-activated tray to help ensure even coverage across all your teeth. “It’s a solid option for people looking for a deeper, more uniform whitening effect at home.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;: Carbamide peroxide&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type&lt;/strong&gt;: Carbamide peroxide gel syringe, LED whitening mouthpiece&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Treatments Included&lt;/strong&gt;: 22&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Use&lt;/strong&gt;: Remove the cap from the whitening gel syringe and apply 0.3 to 0.5 mL of gel to the inner front surface of the tray on both the top and bottom. Insert the tray and light into your mouth, pressing it firmly against your front teeth. Press the power button to turn on the light and whiten for 10 minutes. Afterward, remove the tray and rinse your mouth with warm water.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Budget:&lt;/strong&gt; Ollm Teeth Whitening Kit Gel Pen Strips&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn hxReXn callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-hDFFwy jmjUSU product-embed" data-item='{"ctaHref":"https://cna.st/p/VDkSwjASRpoWbgzpTn4G66ogYkVaetFao7Yon2BgBMEnpCSrYvAEPKPCyDNCbZoHTErpC3uGSHwyFUHJr25e2ApMAKt6j6AiPaj9HXVT1dwaL7GsRmvFqEt7MiMmcJzM1PA9eMaHnDBeMHnP74KGCwKuS4kphTmFmK7ZKBt15ZpwLcT3hkyUGjEUMrFhML1HgsC8d1DKSyPUjDuWyDap6G3snF8ySJJpeRxDDCXCTHTNaQdxCb9VXKoB18QQQbcBuvH82bGxs8vwHouau7gPg","dangerousDek":"","productBrand":"Ollm","dangerousHed":"Teeth Whitening Kit Gel Pen Strips","embedSize":null,"isFirstProduct":false,"isSponsored":false,"offerRetailer":"AMAZON","offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/OLLM-Teeth-Whitening-Kit-Strips/dp/B0CCT7582J/","contentType":"product","productId":"67f7eca1cd8c5787bfe9f559","productOfferVariation":"PriceOutsideCenter","showOfferUrl":false,"showPriceOnButton":true,"showAffiliateDisclaimerOnFirstProduct":false,"dangerousCredit":null,"showLocalisedOffers":true,"isUpcEnabled":true,"showClampedProductDescription":true,"productDescriptionLineLength":5,"hasReadMoreFeature":false,"index":6,"hasAffiliateLinkDisabled":false,"isMobileView":false,"hasMultipleImageSupport":true,"showImageCreditText":false,"showMultipleImageCount":4,"hasProsConsFeature":false,"hasRatingFeature":false,"pros":[],"cons":[],"rating":"","isPrimeExclusive":false,"shouldUseAmazonPrimeDayLiveAPIData":true,"id":"67f7eca1cd8c5787bfe9f559","brand":{"name":"Ollm"},"offers":[{"offerUrl":"https://www.amazon.com/OLLM-Teeth-Whitening-Kit-Strips/dp/B0CCT7582J/","price":"$30","currency":"USD","purchaseUri":"https://cna.st/p/VDkSwjASRpoWbgzpTn4G66ogYkVaetFao7Yon2BgBMEnpCSrYvAEPKPCyDNCbZoHTErpC3uGSHwyFUHJr25e2ApMAKt6j6AiPaj9HXVT1dwaL7GsRmvFqEt7MiMmcJzM1PA9eMaHnDBeMHnP74KGCwKuS4kphTmFmK7ZKBt15ZpwLcT3hkyUGjEUMrFhML1HgsC8d1DKSyPUjDuWyDap6G3snF8ySJJpeRxDDCXCTHTNaQdxCb9VXKoB18QQQbcBuvH82bGxs8vwHouau7gPg","reducedPrice":"$20","sellerName":"AMAZON","countryCode":"US"}],"component":"unified_product_card","hasMultipleImage":false,"componentType":true,"showProsConsData":false,"showBadge":false,"cneIds":[]}'&gt;&lt;div type="embed" class="UnifiedProductCardWrapper-iFnytN gDPsY"&gt;&lt;p class="UnifiedProductCardObject-fQsetj ixCaho"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="UnifiedProductCardBody-bhBobV hTeQWy"&gt;&lt;p class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardBrandName-kBReJq iUEiRd fUKWbF kWVbwh upc-brandName"&gt;Ollm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardNameWrapper-fHyUwm iUEiRd eXWQIZ cBvqln"&gt;&lt;p id="upc_67f7eca1cd8c5787bfe9f559" type="embed" class="BaseWrap-sc-gjQpdd BaseText-ewhhUZ UnifiedProductCardName-jnQGSN iUEiRd qICFz vJQvI"&gt;Teeth Whitening Kit Gel Pen Strips&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It&lt;/strong&gt;: Dr. Wagner describes this kit as a “clever hybrid,” combining the precision of a pen with the ease of a dissolvable strip. “It’s great for targeting specific spots or touching up after a longer whitening cycle, and users love the convenience and low mess factor.” Unlike many at-home kits that require bulky devices or a big time commitment, this one is low-maintenance and travel-friendly, offering flexibility without the need for chargers or accessories.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;: Hydrogen peroxide&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type&lt;/strong&gt;: Hydrogen peroxide gel syringe, LED whitening mouthpiece&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Treatments Included&lt;/strong&gt;: N/A&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Use&lt;/strong&gt;: Apply a thin line of gel to the top and bottom of the tray, then insert it into your mouth. Tap the Auraglow logo to turn on the light and wear the device for 30 minutes for best results.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Gentle:&lt;/strong&gt; Zimba Ultimate Whitening Kit&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why We Love It&lt;/strong&gt;: For anyone who’s experienced irritation from whitening in the past, Dr. Wagner recommends this kit for its strips, which are specifically designed to be gentler on enamel. “That balance, effective but gentle, is what makes a kit safe and sustainable over time,” he says. Whether you’re tackling surface stains or deeper discoloration from coffee or wine, you’ll notice a brighter smile after just 15 minutes. For best results, the brand recommends using it consistently. Each kit includes 14 days’ worth of whitening via whitening strips as well as a whitening pen for touch ups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;: Sodium hydroxide, carbamide peroxide&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Type&lt;/strong&gt;: Whitening strips, LED whitening mouthpiece, carbamide peroxide whitening pen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of Treatments Included&lt;/strong&gt;: 14&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Use&lt;/strong&gt;: N/A&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everything You Need to Know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div name="accordion" class="AccordionWrapper-hIuJtK boBbyN"&gt;&lt;div id="Doteethwhiteningkitswork" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do teeth whitening kits actually work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short answer: yes. The long answer, according to our experts, is that many teeth whitening kits are effective, but their success depends on the product type, ingredients, and the individual’s dental condition, including factors like enamel thickness and natural tooth shade. Dr. Randhawa recommends kits that contain hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide, which are commonly used in professional-grade treatments and are generally effective at lightening teeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, she notes that results vary based on the severity of staining, how consistently the product is used, and whether the stains are intrinsic (deep within the tooth) or extrinsic (on the surface). “Non-peroxide kits may not work as well, and some may contain preservatives that could potentially become acidic,” warns Dr. Rajpal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Randhawa also adds, “It is important to note that whitening thin or gray teeth can be particularly challenging, as these teeth may not respond as effectively. While over-the-counter kits can offer more gradual results, professional treatments typically provide faster and more dramatic improvements.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="Areteethwhiteningkitssafetouse" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are the best teeth whitening kits safe to use?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When used correctly, most over-the-counter teeth whitening kits are safe,” says Dr. Randhawa. However, she emphasizes that it’s important to follow the instructions carefully to avoid overuse, which can lead to tooth sensitivity or gum irritation. For those with sensitive teeth or gums, she recommends choosing a kit specifically formulated for sensitivity, plus consulting with a dentist before beginning any whitening treatment. “Caution should be exercised with DIY whitening methods, as improper use can cause damage. It’s also crucial to avoid swallowing the product, as some ingredients may be harmful if ingested.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="Whatmakesteethwhiter" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes teeth look whiter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Randhawa explains that teeth appear whiter when surface stains are removed, revealing the natural color of the enamel. Common causes of staining include foods and drinks such as coffee, tea, and red wine, as well as smoking, all of which can lead to the buildup of extrinsic stains on the enamel. “The brightness of teeth is also influenced by the thickness and quality of enamel, which is the outer protective layer of the tooth,” she says. Over time, enamel naturally thins due to aging, bruxism (teeth grinding), or prolonged exposure to acidic foods and beverages. “This thinning exposes more of the yellowish dentin beneath, contributing to a duller appearance.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitening treatments can help restore the look of your smile by either removing surface stains or reducing the visibility of yellowing. Whitening gels with active ingredients like hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide contribute to this process by penetrating the enamel. “These compounds work by breaking down stain molecules and chemically bleaching the enamel, lightening the overall tooth shade. Scientific studies have shown that hydrogen peroxide, in particular, is an effective bleaching agent, as it releases oxygen molecules that break apart the chromophores, color-producing molecules, in stains, resulting in visibly brighter teeth,” explains Dr. Randhawa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to whitening, treatments that strengthen and protect enamel, such as remineralizing agents or fluoride treatments, can help preserve tooth structure and prevent further discoloration, enhancing long-term results. Dr. Randhawa also stresses the importance of routine dental cleanings for maintaining a bright smile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="Howtochooseateethwhiteningkit" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerLabel-hZxKcV iNkQjT"&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to Choose a Teeth-Whitening Kit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemContainerContent-cezZtS evpGML opening-animation"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking for faster whitening and more intense results, Dr. Rajpal recommends choosing a hydrogen peroxide gel. “However, if you prefer gentler whitening with longer-lasting results and less risk of sensitivity, you may prefer a carbamide peroxide gel. The most beneficial kits are those that contain either hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide, which are the same active ingredients used by dentists, just in lower concentrations,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Rajpal also notes that whitening strips are easy to apply and mess-free, making them a good option for those who want simplicity. LED kits may require more setup, but they often provide a stronger and more customizable whitening experience. Gel pens are convenient for quick touch-ups, though they may not deliver long-lasting results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When selecting a whitening kit, it’s important to consider factors such as the type of stains you’re targeting (surface level versus deeper stains), your level of tooth sensitivity, and how much time you’re willing to commit to the treatment. Dr. Randhawa also advises checking whether the product has the ADA (American Dental Association) Seal of Acceptance or other professional endorsements to ensure its safety and effectiveness. “It’s important to note that while whitening kits are effective for removing surface stains, they are not designed to treat deeper, intrinsic stains. These types of stains typically require more advanced in-office procedures,” says Dr. Randhawa. Additionally, she reminds us that dental restorations such as bondings, crowns, and veneers will not whiten with these treatments. “Any whitening effect will apply only to natural tooth enamel. Lastly, if you have any concerns or pre-existing dental issues, it’s always a good idea to consult with your dentist before choosing a whitening kit to ensure the best and safest approach for your needs.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="meettheexperts" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionItemWrapper-eGPSID czXIDr"&gt;&lt;div class="AccordionContainer-fEnXXG jomWXA"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="accordion-item-container" class="AccordionItemContainer-jbkqX ckSoPI"&gt;&lt;button class="BaseButton-bLlsy ButtonWrapper-xCepQ cRxydS cIDtfH button button--utility AccordionItemContainerButton-eCWroF XOSgO" data-event-click='{"element":"Button"}' data-testid="Button" role="button" type="button"&gt;&lt;span class="ButtonLabel-cjAuJN bBWXSg button__label"&gt;AccordionItemContainerButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/button&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Vogue</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 15:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZkFVX3lxTE4yZHZBNDNvamR6bkpfZzgxdTVnbXJlWFoxYW9YbVlDZVB6bXZ5cnRYWGpZb1hLWDBVaWZfajJtVmZGVE1xMkpVM190SGJmUmwyb1l5LWdiNTB5RS1ERUtRMk9xZ1p3QQ</guid></item><item><title>前卫生官员批评小RFK小。 | Former top health official criticizes RFK Jr. for downplaying measles deaths - CBS News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxOM29BX3BSMzNVNWp5ZmdLTEdCbGo4Rmk4MzRVM1ZkdFRuMzJyQ0gwalAwcllrbTdjVXhzaUpvejRJWGh3dWltZzl3RWhLRlRfck9mTHpQcW5IU1EtaEpNUEQ0WUFYdWJGSXhVb0gxV1FJSGtPXzdKa2ZaOHh0Y1pheVJCazFjZk5fV0NEdnRRQXV5R0pfY21yMFJrLWZLRF8zVV9ORnl3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section class="content__body"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The former top vaccines official at the Food and Drug Administration criticized Health and Human Services Secretary &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-jr-sweeping-cuts-health-programs-employees-exclusive-interview/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;Robert F. Kennedy Jr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. for downplaying the deaths of unvaccinated children from measles, amid this year's &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreak-us-map/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;record outbreak&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To dismiss children's deaths due to infectious diseases that are preventable by vaccines as just expected or not a big deal, that's just not acceptable to me," said Dr. Peter Marks, in an interview airing Sunday on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weekly measles cases have climbed to the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-cases-weekly-top-90-first-time-years-cdc/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;highest levels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; seen in the U.S. since a 2019 wave of the virus, which had been the worst in decades. Three deaths have been linked to this year's measles outbreak, including two unvaccinated children in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've had three measles deaths in this country over 20 years, and we're trying to refocus the press to get them to pay attention to the chronic disease epidemic," Kennedy said Thursday at a White House Cabinet meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kennedy also contrasted U.S. measles case numbers to Europe, where thousands more infections and dozens of deaths have been reported in recent months. Kennedy has also used the comparison as evidence that his response to the outbreak was a success.&lt;/p&gt;

    
&lt;p id="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" data-ad="mpu-plus-outstream-middle" class="ad-mpu-plus-outstream-middle ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='"mpu-plus-outstream-middle"'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marks criticized Kennedy's comparison, noting that Europe's figures "includes Romania, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, other places that have less robust public health efforts than we do." He also said that "even a single death in this country from measles, it's just— it's just not excusable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's just not the right thing to do. We should be comparing our measles response now to what we accomplished during the first two decades of the 20th century, until the 2019 measles outbreak, which is, we shouldn't be having any deaths from measles," said Marks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Changes at the FDA&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before he was &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-top-vaccine-official-peter-marks-forced-out-decries-rfk-jr-misinformation-and-lies/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;ousted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; by Kennedy's aides, Marks was the director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which regulates vaccines and other medical products derived from living sources. He was also the architect of the Operation Warp Speed effort to speed the development of COVID-19 vaccines during the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He warned that it is now "challenging in this environment" for some of his former colleagues in the federal government to endorse vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc3" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",3]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"There's a whole host of people who can't speak out like I am that are saying, you know, this is a vaccine for which the benefits so greatly outweigh the risks," Marks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Days after Marks submitted his resignation letter, Kennedy implemented &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/job-cuts-federal-health-agencies-rfk-jr/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;steep layoffs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and forced resignations across the FDA, as part of a sweeping restructuring of the nation's health agencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cuts have forced federal health officials to confront difficult decisions, including over &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-food-drug-inspections-layoffs/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;how to prioritize&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; fewer food and drug safety inspections. Marks praised the remaining staff at the agency as "heroes in public health" who are "struggling because there's a lot to be done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They keep tabs on the infections. They make sure that the vaccines that are coming in for approvals might work their way through. They make sure that outbreaks are investigated. Those people are continuing to do their job the best they possibly can," Marks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marks said the delay to an approval decision on Novavax's COVID-19 vaccine, which was expected to be greenlighted earlier this month by the FDA, was concerning. And he warned that his own ouster could signal a change to the agency's approach to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why would you de-emphasize something that is so basic to public health," Marks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;"Does a disservice to pseudoscience"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marks said he never interacted directly with Kennedy as secretary. He also said he did not know much about the administration's efforts to reopen research into the repeatedly debunked theory that vaccines cause autism, amid broader plans to determine the &lt;span class="link"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/peter-marks-fda-official-rfk-jr-false-hope-on-autism/" data-invalid-url-rewritten-http=""&gt;cause of autism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    
    
&lt;p id="leader-plus-inc4" data-ad="leader-plus-inc" class="ad-leader-plus-inc ad-wrapper " data-ad-unit='["leader-plus-inc",4]'&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about Kennedy's claim that "we know it is an environmental toxin" causing autism, Marks said it was "very rare for scientists to speak in absolutes." Kennedy has been criticized for years for &lt;a href="https://kffhealthnews.org/news/article/rfk-kennedy-politifact-lie-of-year-2023-autism-vaccines/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;claiming&lt;/a&gt; that vaccines cause autism, among a range of unfounded claims he has espoused about the danger posed by immunizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most things are not that black and white, and we don't speak in absolutes. Whereas pseudoscientists find it very easy to speak in absolutes because they're not actually looking to use science for the benefit of mankind, they're usually using science for their own benefit," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marks said he was familiar with the past work of Dr. Mark Geier and his son, David Geier, who The Washington Post reported has been tasked by Kennedy this year to revisit a past Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study on vaccines and autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have a firm and fixed notion that vaccines cause autism. So it's very hard for me to see how we're going to get to any other idea than vaccines cause autism," Marks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Describing the work by Geier and his father as pseudoscience "does a disservice to pseudoscience," Marks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Geier was &lt;a href="https://www.mdcourts.gov/sites/default/files/unreported-opinions/0709s14.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;fined by&lt;/a&gt; Maryland regulators for practicing medicine without a license, including for prescribing the drug Lupron to autistic children. Lupron is also used as a chemical castration drug for &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30047834/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"&gt;sex offenders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't know. I can't even conceive as a physician of how he thought that could be a good idea," said Marks.&lt;/p&gt;

This breakthrough allows scientists to observe how pain signals travel from peripheral neurons to the brain for the first time outside the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model, called an assembloid, responds to pain-inducing stimuli and reflects the effects of genetic mutations known to alter pain perception. This innovation could revolutionize drug discovery for pain relief, particularly for conditions like chronic pain or hypersensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Pain Pathway Recreated:&lt;/strong&gt; Four connected brain and spinal organoids simulate human pain signal transmission.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drug Discovery Platform:&lt;/strong&gt; The assembloid enables testing of pain-inducing chemicals and potential pain-blocking drugs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gene-Specific Insights:&lt;/strong&gt; Mutations in Nav1.7 sodium channels altered wave-like neural activity, mimicking pain disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Stanford&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stanford Medicine investigators have replicated, in a lab dish, one of humans’ most prominent nervous pathways for sensing pain. This nerve circuit transmits sensations from the body’s skin to the brain. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once further processed in the brain, these signals will translate into our subjective experience, including the uncomfortable feeling of pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advance promises to accelerate what has been slow progress in understanding how pain signals are processed in humans and how best to alleviate pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108730"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience-770x514.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience-293x196.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a neuron." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience-770x514.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience-293x196.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/organoid-pain-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Missing in these assembloids, importantly, were organoids representing other brain regions that are critical to the discomfort experienced by people who are in pain.

Norris, Jr., Professor II of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, describe their successful assembly of four miniaturized parts of the human nervous system to reconstitute what’s known as the ascending sensory pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The peripheral sensation of pain travels to the brain in a relay involving nerve cells, or neurons, centered in four different regions of the ascending sensory pathway: the dorsal root ganglion, dorsal spinal cord, thalamus and somatosensory cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We can now model this pathway non-invasively,” said Pasca, the study’s senior author. “That will, we hope, help us learn how to better treat pain disorders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead co-authors of the study are postdoctoral scholars Ji-il Kim, PhD, and Kent Imaizumi, MD, PhD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human pain has often proven tough to study in laboratory animals, said Pasca, who is also the Bonnie Uytengsu and Family Director of the Stanford Brain Organogenesis Program. “Their pain pathways are in some respects different from ours,” he said. “Yet these animals experience pain. Our dish-based construct doesn’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until now nobody has been able to watch information being transmitted through this entire pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Pasca and his colleagues witnessed never-before-seen waves of electrical activity travel from the first component of their construct all the way to the last, and they were able to enhance or disrupt these wavelike patterns by gene alterations or chemical stimulation of elements of the circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better drugs needed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Pain is a huge health problem,” said Vivianne Tawfik, MD, PhD, associate professor of anesthesiology, perioperative and pain medicine, who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Some 116 million Americans — more than one in three people in the United States — are dealing with chronic pain of one kind or another,” she said. This pain often persists even when observable damage is no longer evident, possibly due to lasting changes in the ascending sensory pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet treatments for chronic pain are few and far from ideal, she said: “I can’t even tell you how sad it is to sit in front of a patient who’s suffering from chronic pain after we’ve tried everything and there’s nothing left in our arsenal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most “pain medications” aren’t licensed for pain per se but instead borrowed from psychiatrists’ or sleep-disorder specialists’ medicine cabinets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most effective painkillers in the bunch are opioid drugs, which have the severe drawback of being habit-forming, leaving chronic-pain sufferers susceptible to addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building the sensory pathway piece by piece&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tawfik said she thinks the team’s new construct is highly relevant to the study of chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The pathway they’ve reconstructed is the most important one for conveying pain-related information,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regions that compose the ascending sensory pathway are linked by three sets of neuronal connections: The first set relays sensory information from the skin through the dorsal root ganglion to the spinal cord; a second set of neurons passes the signals from the spinal cord to a brain structure called the thalamus; and the third relays this information from the thalamus to the somatosensory cortex for further processing of the signal originating from the periphery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pasca has pioneered the creation of what he calls regionalized neural organoids, grown in a lab dish from stem cells and representing various distinct brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Pasca has pushed this technology forward, pairing organoids of one type with organoids of another type in a dish so they fuse into what he’s named assembloids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurons from one organoid, via growth or migration, can penetrate the other organoid to form working circuits functionally similar to, or even identical to, those they’re meant to mimic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been finding that we don’t need to know the details of assembly of these circuits as long as we make the parts and put them together correctly,” Pasca said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once you put the organoids together, the cells find each other and connect in a meaningful way, giving rise to new features.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new study, Pasca and his colleagues developed human organoids recapitulating the ascending sensory pathway’s four key regions, then fused them together in series to form an assembloid mimicking the pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting with cells from skin samples from volunteers, the team first transformed them into induced pluripotent stem cells, which are essentially de-differentiated cells that can be guided to become virtually any cell type in the human body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used chemical signals to coax these cells into aggregating into tiny balls, called neural organoids, representing each of the four regions of the pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each organoid was a bit less than 1/10 inch in diameter and contained close to a million cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pasca and his colleagues lined up the organoids of those four different types side by side and waited. About 100 days later, they had fused into an assembloid almost 2/5 of an inch long — “They look like tiny sausage links,” Pasca said — and consisting of nearly 4 million cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s less than 1/42,000th of the number in an adult human brain, which contains about 170 billion cells, Pasca noted. But the construct recapitulated the circuitry involved in the pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers showed that the assembloids’ constituent organoids were anatomically connected: Neurons from the first had formed working connections with neurons from the second, the second with the third and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the entire circuit, from the sensory organoid to the cortical organoid, worked as a unit. Once all four organoids had sat beside one another in the flask for about 100 days, patterns of spontaneous, synchronized, directional signaling within the assembloid began to emerge: Neuronal activity in the sensory organoid tripped off similar action in the spinal organoid, then in the thalamic organoid and finally in the cortical organoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You’d never have been able to see this wavelike synchrony if you couldn’t watch all four organoids, connected, simultaneously,” Pasca said. “The brain is more than the sum of its parts.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hot peppers and sodium channels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemicals known to induce pain increased the wavelike activity in the assembloids. Stimulating the sensory organoid with capsaicin — the ingredient in chili peppers that produces a burning sensation in our mouths — triggered immediate waves of neuronal activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rare genetic mutations in an ion-exchange protein found on the surfaces of peripheral sensory neurons can lead to debilitating hypersensitivity to pain or, conversely, a life-threatening inability to experience pain — radically increasing the physical dangers, routine or otherwise, that life serves up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protein in question, Nav1.7, is a particular type of sodium channel that, the researchers observed, abounds on peripheral sensory neurons but is scarce elsewhere. The scientists made an assembloid with its initial, sensory component’s normal version of Nav1.7 replaced by the mutant pain-hypersensitivity version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resulting mutant sensory assembloids displayed more-frequent waves of spontaneous nervous transmission from the sensory through the spinal and thalamic organoids to the cerebral-cortex organoid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Pasca’s team instead rendered the same sodium channel in the sensory organoid non-functional, they got a surprise: Firing from that organoid in response to a pain-inducing chemical continued — but the synchronized wavelike transmission of pain information through the circuit mysteriously vanished. The firing was now out of sync.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The sensory neurons still fired,” Pasca said. “But they failed to engage the rest of the network in a coordinated manner.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Missing in these assembloids, importantly, were organoids representing other brain regions that are critical to the discomfort experienced by people who are in pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The assembloids themselves don’t ‘feel’ any pain,” Pasca said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They transmit nervous signals that need to be further processed by other centers in our brains for us to experience the unpleasant, aversive feeling of pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assembloids, after only a few months of their assembly, represent an early phase of fetal development, he said. Their immediate use would be in studying neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with autism are often hypersensitive to pain and to sensory stimulation in general, and some autism-associated genes are active in the sensory neurons of the ascending sensory pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pasca said that his lab is working on ways to accelerate the development of the assembloids to better understand how the pathway they represent works — or doesn’t — in adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nav1.7 appears to exist mostly on the surfaces of peripheral pain-sensing neurons,” Pasca said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We think screening for drugs that tame sensory organoids’ ability to trigger excessive or inappropriate waves of neuronal transmission through our assembloid, without affecting the brain’s reward circuitry as opioid drugs do — which is why they’re addictive — could lead to better-targeted therapies for pain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stanford University’s office of technology licensing has filed a patent for intellectual property associated with this assembloid, with Pasca, Kim and Imaizumi named as co-inventors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A researcher from the University of North Carolina contributed to the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health (grants R01MH107800, R01NS128028 and CNCDP-K12), the NYSCF Robertson Stem Cell Society, the Stanford Human Brain Organogenesis Project, the Kwan Research Fund, the Senkut Research Funds and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this pain and neurotech research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#31565e5d555c505f53714245505f575e43551f545544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Bruce Goldman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://stanford.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Stanford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Bruce Goldman – Stanford&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-08808-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Human assembloid model of the ascending neural sensory pathway&lt;/a&gt;” by Sergiu Pasca et al. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human assembloid model of the ascending neural sensory pathway&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somatosensory pathways convey crucial information about pain, touch, itch and body part movement from peripheral organs to the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite substantial needs to understand how these pathways assemble and to develop pain therapeutics, clinical translation remains challenging. This is probably related to species-specific features and the lack of in vitro models of the polysynaptic pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here we established a human ascending somatosensory assembloid (hASA), a four-part assembloid generated from human pluripotent stem cells that integrates somatosensory, spinal, thalamic and cortical organoids to model the spinothalamic pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transcriptomic profiling confirmed the presence of key cell types of this circuit. Rabies tracing and calcium imaging showed that sensory neurons connect to dorsal spinal cord neurons, which further connect to thalamic neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following noxious chemical stimulation, calcium imaging of hASA demonstrated a coordinated response. In addition, extracellular recordings and imaging revealed synchronized activity across the assembloid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, loss of the sodium channel Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.7, which causes pain insensitivity, disrupted synchrony across hASA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, a gain-of-function &lt;em&gt;SCN9A&lt;/em&gt; variant associated with extreme pain disorder induced hypersynchrony.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These experiments demonstrated the ability to functionally assemble the essential components of the human sensory pathway, which could accelerate our understanding of sensory circuits and facilitate therapeutic development.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 14:59:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTFBCcWw4YXp5WENwSjRaUHIyOVYwQUVDZjBDWFNLelFFNi1EbjdZWFRQWnNTODMxZW5DWE10MjdSOVZGeGRQREZmcHBwZEltV2FNbmQxc202YXNCN29XOUpFYXpHdjNNVWdSOXcxVk8tbw</guid></item></channel></rss>
