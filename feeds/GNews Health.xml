			&lt;p&gt;When it comes to exercising for your heart's sake, you don't want to peak too early in life. Research suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/turning-point-in-heart-health-occurs-at-1-key-age-its-younger-than-youd-think"&gt;to protect yourself&lt;/a&gt; against high blood pressure in your twilight years, you need to keep your exercise levels up through middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But according to a study of more than 5,000 people across four US cities, social factors can make this more difficult for some people than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Teenagers and those in their early 20s may be physically active but these patterns change with age," epidemiologist Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2021/04/420281/want-be-robust-40-plus-meeting-minimum-exercise-guidelines-wont-cut-it"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; in April 2021, when the research was published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/this-simple-daily-habit-could-help-lower-your-blood-pressure"&gt;This Simple Daily Habit Could Help Lower Your Blood Pressure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous studies have shown that exercise lowers blood pressure, but the 2021 research suggests that "maintaining physical activity during young adulthood – at higher levels than previously recommended – may be particularly important," Bibbins-Domingo &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2021/04/420281/want-be-robust-40-plus-meeting-minimum-exercise-guidelines-wont-cut-it"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_96226" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96226" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/05/ExerciseScienceWeightLoss-642x260.jpg" alt="Older man running on street wearing orange t-shirt." class="wp-image-96226 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/05/ExerciseScienceWeightLoss-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/05/ExerciseScienceWeightLoss.jpg 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/05/ExerciseScienceWeightLoss-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/05/ExerciseScienceWeightLoss-600x243.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-96226" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Maintaining physical activity could be even more important than we knew. (South_agency/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a serious condition affecting billions of people worldwide. It can lead to heart attacks and stroke; it's also a risk factor for &lt;a href="study-suggests-diabetes-and-high-blood-pressure-might-also-be-affecting-your-mind" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;developing dementia in later life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-blood-pressure-guidelines-mean-you-could-now-have-hypertension"&gt;New Blood Pressure Guidelines Mean You Could Now Have Hypertension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upwards of one in four men and about every fifth woman has hypertension, &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/hypertension/#tab=tab_1"&gt;according to the World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt;. But most people with high blood pressure don't even know they have it – hence why it's often called the "silent killer".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet there are ways to turn high blood pressure around: exercise is the focus of this study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 5,100 adults were recruited for the study, which tracked their health over three decades through physical assessments and questionnaires on exercise habits, smoking status, and alcohol intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At each clinical assessment, blood pressure was measured three times, 1 minute apart, and, for data analysis, participants were grouped into four categories by race and gender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the board – amongst men, women, and in both racial groups – levels of physical activity slumped from 18 to 40 years of age, with rates of hypertension rising and physical activity falling over subsequent decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the researchers, this suggests that &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-simple-change-to-your-standing-desk-could-make-workdays-healthier"&gt;young adulthood is an important window for intervening&lt;/a&gt; to prevent midlife hypertension with health promotion programs designed to boost exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/a-5-minute-workout-each-day-can-still-make-a-huge-health-difference"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A 5-Minute Workout Each Day Can Still Make a Huge Health Difference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nearly half of our participants in young adulthood had suboptimal levels of physical activity, which was significantly associated with the onset of hypertension, indicating that we need to raise the minimum standard for physical activity," &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2021/04/420281/want-be-robust-40-plus-meeting-minimum-exercise-guidelines-wont-cut-it"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; lead author Jason Nagata, a UCSF expert in young adult medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_80404" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-80404" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/11/DumbbellExercise-642x260.jpg" alt="Someone lifting a dumbbell behind their head" class="wp-image-80404 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/11/DumbbellExercise-642x260.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/11/DumbbellExercise.jpg 1024w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/11/DumbbellExercise-768x311.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2022/11/DumbbellExercise-600x243.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-80404" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Physical activity often declines with age, but this can have consequences for your health. (Watchara Piriyaputtanapun/Moment/Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers looked at people who had done 5 hours of moderate exercise a week during early adulthood – double the minimum amount currently recommended for adults – they found that this level of activity lowered the risk of hypertension considerably, especially if people maintained their exercise habits until age 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Achieving at least twice the current minimum adult [physical activity] guidelines may be more beneficial for the prevention of hypertension than simply meeting the minimum guidelines," the researchers &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2020.12.018"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; in their paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it's not easy to step up physical activity each week amid life-changing decisions and growing responsibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This might be especially the case after high school when opportunities for physical activity diminish as young adults transition to college, the workforce, and parenthood, and leisure time is eroded," &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2021/04/420281/want-be-robust-40-plus-meeting-minimum-exercise-guidelines-wont-cut-it"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Nagata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/not-all-sitting-is-equal-one-type-was-just-linked-to-better-brain-health"&gt;Not All Sitting Is Equal. One Type Was Just Linked to Better Brain Health.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for another sobering truth, the study also showed how Black men and Black women experience starkly different health trajectories compared to their White counterparts. At 40 years of age, physical activity levels plateaued among White men and women, whereas activity levels in Black participants continued to decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By age 45, Black women surpassed White men in rates of hypertension, while White women in the study experienced the lowest rates of hypertension through midlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And by age 60, between 80 and 90 percent of Black men and women had hypertension, compared with just below 70 percent for White men and around half of White women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research team attributed these well-known racial disparities to a multitude of social and economic factors; however, these factors were not assessed in this study, although high school education was noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although Black male youth may have high engagement in sports, socioeconomic factors, neighborhood environments, and work or family responsibilities may prevent continued engagement in physical activity through adulthood," Nagata &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2021/04/420281/want-be-robust-40-plus-meeting-minimum-exercise-guidelines-wont-cut-it"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2020.12.018"&gt;American Journal of Preventive Medicine.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in April 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Many of the body's processes slow down or falter as we get older, including &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/body-resurrects-cells-marked-for-death-solving-a-50-year-mystery"&gt;tissue regeneration&lt;/a&gt;. In a new study, researchers detail a promising method to get this vital repair work back up to speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, from a team at the University of California, San Francisco, identified four &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_factor"&gt;transcription factors&lt;/a&gt; – proteins that control the activity of other genes – that have a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-discover-a-way-to-recharge-aging-human-cells"&gt;rejuvenating effect&lt;/a&gt; on cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the researchers boosted production of one of these transcription factors in the liver cells of elderly mice, they noticed numerous benefits: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/5-daily-habits-could-be-causing-your-liver-serious-harm"&gt;fat and scarring&lt;/a&gt; were significantly reduced, and glucose tolerance improved – all signs of a more youthful organ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/blood-of-exceptionally-long-lived-people-reveals-crucial-differences"&gt;Blood of Exceptionally Long-Lived People Reveals Crucial Differences&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team also tinkered with the levels of all four transcription factors in lab-grown human &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroblast"&gt;fibroblast cells&lt;/a&gt;. Fibroblasts make up connective tissue and provide scaffolding around other cells and organs. Again, multiple signs of youthfulness were spotted as a result, including increased cell division and boosted energy levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By altering gene expression using the transcription factors we identified, old fibroblasts behaved as if they were younger, and improved the health of old mice," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1112231"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biochemist Hao Li.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188901" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188901" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/LiverScarring.jpg" alt="Liver scarring diagram" class="wp-image-188901 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/LiverScarring.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/LiverScarring-600x419.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188901" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Increasing the expression of EZH2 (bottom row), one of four transcription factors identified, reduced liver scarring (blue stain) in older mice compared to controls (top row). (Sengstack et al., &lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;, 2026)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To identify the four key transcription factors, the researchers first compared old and young human fibroblast cells using a computational model to see how &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/hundreds-of-genes-act-differently-in-male-vs-female-brains-scientists-discover"&gt;gene expression&lt;/a&gt; differed with age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having drawn up a shortlist of 200 transcription factors that could be controlling the 'youthfulness' of cells, they began systematically toggling them on and off – changing the transcription factors produced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of this tinkering led the researchers to the final four transcription factors that they tested in more detail: E2F3, EZH2, STAT3, and ZFX. Altering the levels of these factors in liver cells of mice and human fibroblast cells grown in plastic dishes shifted the cells &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-restore-aging-blood-stem-cells-to-a-more-youthful-state-in-mice"&gt;towards a younger mode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that these proteins had an effect across two different species and cell types suggests we could be looking at a universal blueprint of sorts, one that could be broadly applied to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/young-immune-cells-partly-reverse-alzheimers-symptoms-in-mice"&gt;reactivate youthful states&lt;/a&gt; in older cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These results suggest a shared set of molecular requirements for cellular and tissue rejuvenation across species," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2515183123"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's still early days for this research, and we're not yet talking about &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/gains-in-human-life-expectancy-may-have-already-passed-their-peak"&gt;extending lifespans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/axolotl-discovery-brings-us-closer-than-ever-to-regrowing-human-limbs"&gt;replacing limbs&lt;/a&gt; or rejuvenating the whole body. We only have the results from a few cell types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term safety needs to be considered, too. The experiments in mice lasted only a few weeks, so we still don't know what effects rejuvenating cells in this manner might have over extended periods. Too much cell growth connected to EZH2 has been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1933744100"&gt;linked with cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, with a global population that's growing older and living longer, potential ways of keeping our bodies &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-turning-point-when-your-bodys-aging-accelerates"&gt;healthier for longer&lt;/a&gt; should warrant further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our work opens up exciting new opportunities to understand and ultimately reverse aging-related diseases," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1112231"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; biochemist Janine Sengstack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2515183123"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PNAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The paper, based on a review of 25 cluster cases, found that the patients had all suffered from known and diagnosable illnesses including cancer and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;The lead author of the JAMA paper, Dr Anthony Lang, told the BBC on Friday that the provincial report "confirms our suspicion or belief that there was no environmental factor that could have accounted for such a broad range of neurological problems". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"There was no consistent neurological disease that we had seen in this small group of patients we described," Lang added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"So this just confirms exactly what we've suspected and really emphasises the suffering and pain that patients and families have had."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Nesbitt and other patients have rejected accusations that Marrero has misdiagnosed patients, and said he rightfully raised concerns about their test results of elevated metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;She added some patients have expressed they do not want to see another neurologist "because they don't trust anybody anymore".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"He's a kind man, he's intelligent, he does due diligence," Nesbitt said, adding that he has done a considerable amount of testing on patients to help give them answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;Marrero did not immediately reply to a request for comment about Friday's report. In September, he told the BBC that other senior federal and provincial scientists had also believed there was a novel syndrome in New Brunswick and that he was now being portrayed as the sole purveyor of the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 eZyhnA"&gt;"They are trying to present me as it," he said. "I was part of it, but I was not it. The only difference is, when the table was empty, I stayed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 20:01:14 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1VMzBWT2dPdmFsTTlfbUhfc3ZncVlEMlV3NGRhS3J3SU10TGkxRERiLXp1RVFzN1NPRzVBUnlKQmVkRmdZQ2JMdmM0ZWc2bHIxMjdBWmI5a3RPd9IBX0FVX3lxTFBwTFVWUjFHV0tkUG43M3NyRVFjc0d6N3c0aWU4ZF9xVU5BSWMtUjhib1ZYUC1hOEEtOW96Rk83cEZIQkRpN1NoNEY4YWpFYTE1bnBaUnFPU0JIZlEtdTlz</guid></item><item><title>旧金山报告本季首例流感死亡病例，加利福尼亚州各地病例呈上升趋势--《旧金山纪</title><link>https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/san-francisco-flu-deaths-21311591.php</link><description>&lt;body id="readabilityBody"&gt;

So far I have everything from 2025 to 2018 updated. The great news is every recipe on my site is linked to WW recipe builder (only works from your phone) so it will automatically give you the new points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why High Protein?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As many of you know, I’ve been following a &lt;a href="https://www.skinnytaste.com/high-protein/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow"&gt;high-protein&lt;/a&gt; diet for the past few years for muscle gain, and it’s been a total game changer for me! I feel stronger and more satisfied, which keeps me from reaching for sweets or chips between meals or at the end of the day. I know a lot of you struggle with hitting your protein goals, so I was inspired to create this &lt;a href="https://www.skinnytaste.com/high-protein/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow"&gt;high-protein&lt;/a&gt; meal plan for the week. If you enjoy it, I’ll share 1 or 2 each month. Plus, I’m working on a high-protein cookbook, so stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To reach my protein goals, I typically divide it across three meals. For example, if my goal is 120 grams of protein per day, I aim for at least 30 grams per meal, plus 10 to 30 grams with each snack. If you’re not sure how much protein you should eat in a day, this &lt;a href="https://examine.com/guides/protein-intake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow external" data-wpel-link="external"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; may be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How It Works&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re new to my &lt;a href="https://www.skinnytaste.com/meal-plans/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow"&gt;meal plans&lt;/a&gt;, these are meant as a guide, with &lt;strong&gt;plenty of wiggle room&lt;/strong&gt; for you to &lt;strong&gt;add more food&lt;/strong&gt;, coffee, beverages, fruits, &lt;a href="https://www.skinnytaste.com/recipes/snacks/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow"&gt;snacks&lt;/a&gt;, dessert, etc. or swap recipes out for meals you prefer, you can search for &lt;a href="https://www.skinnytaste.com/recipes/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow"&gt;recipes&lt;/a&gt; by course in the &lt;a href="https://www.skinnytaste.com/recipes/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self" rel="follow"&gt;index&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on your goals, you should aim for at least 1500 calories* per day. There’s no one size fits all, this will range by your goals, your age, weight, etc. Always talk to your nutritionist or dietician for your specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Note&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Those with kidney or liver disease, gout, specific metabolic disorders, or older adults with reduced kidney function may need to limit protein to avoid complications. It’s always best to consult a healthcare provider or dietitian before significantly increasing protein intake, especially if you have any underlying health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

"It's very clear based on where these outbreaks are occurring."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;The CDC currently &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; that people receive two doses of the MMR vaccine, the first at ages 12 to 15 months and the second between 4 and 6 years old. One dose is 93% effective, and two doses are 97% effective against measles, the CDC says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;However, federal data shows vaccination rates have been lagging in recent years. During the 2024-2025 school year, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;92.5% of kindergartners received the MMR vaccine&lt;/a&gt;, according to data.

&lt;p&gt;Far out in the South China Sea, a massive underwater sinkhole plunges&lt;strong&gt; nearly 1,000 feet straight down&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s called the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dragon Hole&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s a strange, silent world where oxygen vanishes and sunlight never reaches. Yet somehow, deep inside, life finds a way, just not the kind we’re used to. First charted by Chinese scientists in 2016, the &lt;em&gt;Sansha Yongle Blue Hole&lt;/em&gt; quickly drew attention for being one of the deepest known sinkholes on Earth. But its real mystery lies inside. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Deeper than Deep and Built to Last&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At &lt;strong&gt;301 meters (998 feet) deep&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;162.3 meters (535 feet) wide&lt;/strong&gt;, the Dragon Hole is one of the largest ocean sinkholes ever recorded. As reported in a study &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-35220-x#Abs1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, researchers believe it formed during a period when sea levels were much lower. Rainwater slowly dissolved the limestone below, carving out steep walls in a kind of underwater stair-step shape. Later, when sea levels rose, the hole flooded and became what it is today.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What makes the Dragon Hole truly unusual is how still it is. Because the opening is narrow and the sides are steep, the usual ocean mixing doesn’t happen. Water from the surface doesn’t reach the bottom, and fresh oxygen doesn’t make it in. Chinese researchers from the &lt;em&gt;First Institute of Oceanography&lt;/em&gt; found that oxygen levels drop sharply below the surface and vanish completely well before the midpoint. This creates several distinct zones in the water, each with its own chemistry and life forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Life Without Oxygen Or Light&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Below 100 meters, everything changes. No fish, algae or plants survive past that point. But according to &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40793-025-00778-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Environmental Microbiome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, bacteria fill the gap, thriving in complete darkness by using chemical reactions to produce energy. In the first deep layer, known as &lt;strong&gt;Anoxic Zone I&lt;/strong&gt;, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria are everywhere. Two types, &lt;em&gt;Thiomicrorhabdus&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sulfurimonas&lt;/em&gt;, make up&lt;strong&gt; nearly 90 percent of all microbial life &lt;/strong&gt;in this section.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Deeper still, &lt;strong&gt;past 140 meters&lt;/strong&gt;, researchers identified &lt;strong&gt;Anoxic Zone II&lt;/strong&gt;. In this area, nitrate disappears and hydrogen sulfide begins to build up. The &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/12/nasa-discovers-bacteria-playing-dead-to-survive-extreme-space-conditions/" data-type="post" data-id="111924"&gt;bacteria &lt;/a&gt;there shift to a new kind of metabolism known as &lt;strong&gt;sulfate reduction&lt;/strong&gt;. Species like &lt;em&gt;Desulfatiglans&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Desulfobacter&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Desulfovibrio&lt;/em&gt; become dominant. Green sulfur bacteria such as &lt;em&gt;Prosthecochloris&lt;/em&gt; also appear, along with other rare microbes like &lt;em&gt;Chloroflexi&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Parcubacteria&lt;/em&gt;. Each group is specially adapted to the harsh, oxygen-free conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A Sealed World Full Of Surprises&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the lab, researchers managed to grow &lt;strong&gt;294 strains of bacteria&lt;/strong&gt; from samples taken inside the hole. More than &lt;strong&gt;22 percent&lt;/strong&gt; of the anaerobic bacteria they found had &lt;strong&gt;never been identified before&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scientists also looked at the viruses living in the &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2025/07/scientists-reveal-a-bizarre-gravity-hole-beneath-the-indian-ocean-its-origins-are-more-alarming-than-expected/"&gt;hole&lt;/a&gt;. They discovered &lt;strong&gt;1,730 distinct types&lt;/strong&gt;, mostly from phage families like &lt;em&gt;Caudoviricetes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Megaviricetes&lt;/em&gt;. But deeper in the anoxic layers, the viral landscape changes. Many of the &lt;a href="https://dailygalaxy.com/2026/01/scientists-viruses-behave-strangely-space/" data-type="post" data-id="117781"&gt;viruses &lt;/a&gt;found there couldn’t be linked to any known group. These unknown viruses could play a big role in how microbial life functions in extreme environments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;li&gt;A&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; poll shows &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/voters-skeptical-of-rfk-jr-s-vaccine-overhaul-112f5144" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;half of US voters&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;are less confident in federal vaccine guidance due to Trump administration policies, with 50% disapproving of Trump’s handling of the changes to routine vaccine recommendations. About 36% of those polled said they approve of changes to federal vaccine guidance, while 13% said they were unsure. The poll also showed that health insurance costs, including rising premiums, are a top priority for voters in a midterm election year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The family of that girl is urging residents and clinicians to be on the watch for histoplasmosis and increase early testing. The girl’s mother said she did not receive a positive histoplasmosis diagnosis until after her death. According to local news, histoplasmosis is commonly found throughout the soil in Tennessee. A cluster of more than 30 human cases has been identified in Williamson and Maury counties, but so far there has not been a clear source of exposure.&lt;/li&gt;

All three cases were reported to the WHO from January 9 and 15, and all three involve children, including a 5-year-old from Hubei province, an 8-year-old from Jiangsu&lt;span&gt; &lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;province, and a 1-year-old from Guangxi province. All had symptom onset in November and December of last year. Only the child from Hubei province had a known exposure to backyard poultry. All three patients have recovered.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this admin doubles down by withdrawing &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/public-health/us-formally-withdrawals-world-health-organization-leaving-debt" target="_blank"&gt;From WHO, though leaving debt behind.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is all relatively straightforward, but it turns out the significance of Dr Epley and his manoeuvre is considerably greater (importantly so) than previously appreciated. Dr Hilary Cox of Newcastle University reports that those calcium crystals may also account for a much wider range of balance problems and predisposition to falls (with all their attendant hazards) in the older age group, even in the absence of those classic symptoms of acute positional change induced vertigo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is necessarily more difficult to ascertain and remedy, nonetheless “barriers to diagnosis and treatment can be overcome with simple practical measures”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="u-heading-size-medium u-heading-style-normal"&gt;An unusual remedy for hiccups which does not require a trip to A&amp;amp;E&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="ck-custom-link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/12/31/millions-go-to-ae-for-hiccups-and-sore-throats/"&gt;As recently reported&lt;/a&gt; in this paper, many more people nowadays are heading to A&amp;amp;E for their ‘minor’ symptoms: for coughs a tenfold increase over the past five years to 435,000, almost 300,000 for constipation, 69,000 for a blocked nose, 20,000 for nausea and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still the surprising revelation of 4,200 attendances for hiccups would certainly suggest the need for a greater appreciation of the diverse range of simple remedies. The most familiar – holding one’s breath and counting to 40 – is presumed to splint the diaphragm (stop it moving), countering the spontaneous muscular contractions responsible for the hiccup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that does not work, several methods of sipping water can be tried. “My mother used to make me stand, bend over a glass of water and take regular sips from the wrong (far) side of the glass”, one reader recalls. Another advises, “Grip the nose, press the ear flaps inwards and drink from a cup of water.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The erstwhile world authority on hiccups, Dr Janet Travell, advised the rather different approach of stimulating the uvula, the fleshy protuberance at the back of the throat. This can be accomplished by, for example, pulling forcefully on the tongue or stroking with a cotton bud. Swallowing dry granulated sugar or sucking on a lemon wedge soaked in Angostura Bitters may be effective for similar impact on the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, there is the option of activating the autonomic nervous system that controls the rhythmic contractions of the muscles of the diaphragm. This is most readily accomplished by pressing on the eyeballs or massaging the carotid artery on the side of the neck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1988, emergency physician Dr Francis Fesmire reported the impressive benefits of a more intrusive method in a 27-year-old man afflicted with hiccupping up to 30 times a minute for 72 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When pulling on the tongue and eyeball compression proved unsuccessful, slow circumferential rectal massage was attempted. The frequency of the hiccups slowed immediately and ceased soon after.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Email queries and comments in confidence to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ck-anchor ck-custom-link" href="mailto:Drjames@telegraph.co.uk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drjames@telegraph.co.uk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But for KayLynne Felthager, that split-second habit would end up turning into a medical emergency she never saw coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Okay, so it’s two different days,” Felthager says, explaining that everything started on Jan. 4, 2023, when she was driving home from Walmart and felt a headache coming on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Felthager said cracking her neck was something she used to do all the time when headaches hit. “I used to always, it was a habit,” she says. “I would get a headache and I would immediately crack my neck.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She remembered stretching her head far to the right until she felt a crack on the left side of her neck. She also noted that she didn’t use her hands to force it, something she said people online later assumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, she thought nothing of it and even felt a moment of relief. But almost immediately after, she said she felt sharp, severe pain radiating down her neck in a way that didn’t feel normal for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days, the pain didn’t fade, and Felthager said she struggled to move her head without hurting. She relied on over-the-counter pain medication just to get through the discomfort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as the ache lingered through the weekend, she tried to keep living her life and pushed through plans with her family. She said she noticed how strange it felt, but still didn’t suspect anything serious was building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then on Jan. 9, the warning signs became impossible to ignore. Felthager said she was sitting at the kitchen island doing her makeup before a date night when a bright light suddenly took over her right eye, and her vision disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I had, like, a blinding light come through my right eye, and then lost vision,” she recalls. “It was just like I could see this bright light, but nothing else out of the right side.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of KayLynne Felthager&lt;/p&gt; KayLynne Felthager and her husband&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;She tried blinking hard, hoping it would go away, and even attempted to research what was happening. But she said she couldn’t see clearly enough to make sense of anything, and the moment left her rattled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 15 minutes later, her vision returned, and she assumed she was heading into yet another headache. Still, her body didn’t feel right, and she said she told her husband something felt “off” as they drove into town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after, she said the entire right side of her body became tingly and then went numb. Even then, she describes the sensations as confusing more than frightening, like her body was throwing strange signals she couldn’t interpret fast enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scariest moment, she said, was when she tried to speak and realized she couldn’t form real words. “It literally just came out, like jumbled gibberish,” Felthager says, remembering how her husband immediately turned the car toward the ER.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once inside, doctors rushed her back, and from there, parts of the experience blur together. She remembers a flurry of movement, nurses working to start an IV, and being taken back for a CT scan with contrast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the middle of the chaos, Felthager said her mind latched onto one word as everything else felt unreachable. “The only word I could honestly think of was God,” she says. “And I just, like, kept repeating that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She recalls being shown picture cards as doctors tried to evaluate her, but she struggled to name what she was seeing. Slowly, she said things began to return, from recognizing loved ones to being able to speak again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Felthager said doctors told her she’d suffered an artery dissection and a clot had traveled to her brain, causing a stroke. She was told the clot dissolved before they had to intervene, something she said she still feels grateful for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because she lives in a small town in Colorado, she said doctors decided she needed to be transferred for more specialized treatment. She was flown by helicopter to a larger hospital, a detail that she said still feels surreal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the hospital, Felthager said doctors told her artery dissections can happen in situations involving chiropractic adjustments or cracking the neck. One doctor tried to calm her fears, but she remembers thinking it was easier said than done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her neurologist also offered another possible trigger: Felthager said she’d recently had the stomach flu and had been violently sick. “She was like, either from violently puking or from you cracking your neck, is what this happened from,” Felthager says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afterward, she said she was placed on heavy blood thinners and later continued on aspirin while she healed. For months, she followed up with regular CT scans until she said doctors confirmed she was fully recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Obviously, they were like, ‘Maybe stop cracking your neck,’ ” she says. “And I was like, fair. I will never again.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesy of KayLynne Felthager&lt;/p&gt; KayLynne Felthager and her husband&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, nearly three years later, Felthager said she feels healthy and back to normal physically. But emotionally, she said the experience changed how she thinks about her body and how quickly something can go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have a little more health anxiety,” she says, explaining that even small changes in her vision can still send her spiraling. She adds that anxiety sometimes extends to her kids and husband, too, because the stroke taught her how fragile “normal” can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the time since, Felthager said life has moved forward in joyful ways, including welcoming another baby into their family. And unexpectedly, her story found a huge new audience when she posted about it on &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kaylynnefelthager/video/7579389274747931917" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:TikTok;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the viral video wasn’t some carefully planned warning, but a quick post she made while trying to grow her account. “Honestly, it was just like a filler post,” she says, explaining she expected her usual few hundred views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, she watched it blow up, and with the attention came intense reactions. “Oh, my goodness, I stopped replying because I was like, I can’t handle some of these people,” she says, laughing at how overwhelming the comments became.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never miss a story — sign up for &lt;a href="https://people.com/people-news-daily-newsletter-sign-up-8692701" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:PEOPLE's free daily newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;PEOPLE's free daily newsletter&lt;/a&gt; to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking back, Felthager said the biggest surprise was realizing how many people immediately saw themselves in her story. “People are, they can get really freaked out by health things,” she says, adding she understands because she lives with that anxiety now, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while she knows her story can sound scary, she said her intention has never been to send people into panic. “I don’t want to scare people,” she says. “It’s just what happened to me.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://people.com/woman-who-routinely-cracked-her-neck-suffers-stroke-exclusive-11890602" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:People;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;People&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 14:40:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxOVUF6bmExT0NycURuUXo1Qng0NTRFTU8xa0VqRUp2dWhRTldFVHBTN2R3ODN2cFR5ZEdFcy15LVVVY1NadmRQXzVjRVg3ZDNoWmZ2VmRTbHN1dzlqeTh5LW9pUEU0ODI5MHFLUkJiUGdYUGhpUGRoaU5nT0E4V25ULW5n</guid></item><item><title>新英格兰的哪些城镇最容易爆发麻疹？一张新地图提供了线索。-《波士顿环球报》</title><link>https://www.bostonglobe.com/2026/01/23/metro/measles-cases-outbreak-massachusetts/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="body | gutter_16--desktop gutter_16--tablet paywalled_content
              "&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The Commonwealth has ZIP codes that range from very low risk for a measles outbreak, such as Winthrop’s 02152, to very high risk, such as Middlefield’s 01243 and Conway’s 01341, based on the percentage of children younger than 5 who have had at least one shot of measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Compared to other New England states such as New Hampshire and Vermont, Massachusetts has comparatively fewer high-risk ZIP codes. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Outbreaks are much more likely to happen where there is low vaccination,” said Dr. Ben Rader, scientific director of Boston Children’s Hospital’s innovation group, who coauthored the paper with Brownstein. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In their study, the researchers sought to capture children who are often missing from official reporting systems, such as those who are homeschooled, uninsured, or too young to attend kindergarten. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;For that reason, their estimates for the number of kids vaccinated for measles are lower than those of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Brownstein and Rader started this work while researching vaccine hesitancy during the COVID-19 pandemic. They noticed that skepticism surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine seemed to spill over into routine childhood immunization, including the measles, mumps, and rubella, or MMR, shot.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;To gather their data, the researchers used an online surveillance platform called Outbreaks Near Me, where parents voluntarily reported whether their children under 5 had received at least one dose of the MMR vaccine. They then applied a&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;statistical method that uses limited survey data and population information to estimate what’s happening in a community, and a geospatial AI tool developed by Google to estimate vaccination rate down to the ZIP code level. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Places that we found had severe pockets of under-vaccination ultimately became sources of major outbreaks in the US, like in West Texas and New Mexico,” Brownstein said. “But even more concerning is that it will likely reflect where we’re going to see future outbreaks in the coming years.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Dr. David Hamer, professor of global health and medicine at Boston University, said Massachusetts remains relatively protected except for a few areas. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;However, New England’s interconnectedness complicates risk. Travel between states increases the chance that measles from higher-risk areas could spread. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It just increases our vulnerability for those areas in our state in particular that might have low vaccination rates,” said Dr. Nahid Bhadelia, an infectious disease physician and founding director of Boston University Center on emerging infectious diseases. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Bhadelia noted that parts of Western Massachusetts are beginning to show lower vaccination coverage. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The concern for a state like Massachusetts that still maintains a pretty high overall vaccination is when you get these coalescing pockets of lower immunity,” she said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Hamer said measles is one of the most contagious viruses known, requiring population-wide vaccination rates of roughly 93 to 95 percent to maintain herd immunity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“Vaccination, of course, is about protecting yourself and your families, but it’s also about your community,” Brownstein said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Bhadelia said that losing measles elimination status would signal more than just a symbolic failure. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It really gives you a state of the nation in terms of our public health and our public health readiness and preparedness,” she said. “It’s reputational, but it also is saying something about disease burden within the country.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;A panel of international experts will review the US’s &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/19/well/year-anniversary-measles-outbreak-elimination-status.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/19/well/year-anniversary-measles-outbreak-elimination-status.html"&gt;measles elimination status&lt;/a&gt; later this year. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;She said rapid case identification, contact tracing, and public education will be essential to prevent outbreaks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“The best we can do is continue to make sure that children are getting their first dose of MMR, and that they’re getting their second dose at the appropriate age,” Hamer said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends children receive their first dose between the ages of 12 and 15 months and the second dose between ages 4 and 6. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Despite growing risks nationwide, Massachusetts’ strong public health infrastructure remains a critical safeguard.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“We’re great, but we’re not perfect,” Brownstein said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

Gut-wrenchingly said she was on a journey toward forgiving the driver who crashed into her family three years earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She became a campaigner for increased highway safety while raising her family, but in June 2025 Chris says he began to realize something was wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He told People that he noticed Lori was 'getting more clumsy', and would accidentally run into walls, stub her toe, and drop drinking glasses on a more regular basis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Within a month, he says he noticed stroke-like symptoms, as Lori's 'mouth started to droop a little bit... it became too much to ignore.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After taking her to hospital, Lori was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, devastating the family almost 20 years after the tragedy that took the lives of their three young children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I was hoping we were done with the life-changing, life-altering disasters where life as you knew it yesterday is gone,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;In 2007,  a big rig truck slammed into the back of Lori Coble's  minivan, killing her children Kyle Christopher, 5, Emma Lynn, 4, and Katie Gene, 2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lori is pictured with her husband Chris and the triplets she gave birth to a year after the deaths of her other three children. Tragically, she has now died of brain cancer aged just 48 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lori died on Wednesday evening aged 48, just weeks after being put on hospice care with stage 4 glioblastoma. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;her family shared the news on social media, writing that she was 'deeply loved and supported throughout this journey' as she fought the disease for months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Lori was deeply loved and supported throughout this journey. She was surrounded by care, peace, and those who held her close as she passed,' her family wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Her strength, kindness, and quiet courage touched far more people than she ever realized.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The family received an outpouring of support, as many paid tribute to Lori for having rebuilt her life in the wake of losing her children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Earlier this month, Chris told People as his wife entered hospice care that only welcoming their triplets - Jake Christopher, Ashley Lynn, Ellie Gene, each carrying an older sibling's middle name - got him through the heartbreak almost 20 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It took me over four years to come out of the fog and pain of what happened,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lori shared her story with Oprah in 2010, where she said being blessed with triplets felt like a miracle, and gut-wrenchingly said she was on a journey toward forgiving the driver who crashed into her family three years earlier&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Lori's husband Chris said her terminal brain cancer diagnosis was devastating after having previously lost their children.

But at the same time, I was trying to avoid falling apart in front of them, I’d go into the other room and cry real quick and come back and put a smile on my face.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Family friend Becky Leonard said Lori re-dedicated herself to raising her triplets, saying she found her resilience 'extraordinary.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Everybody who knows her, loves her,' she said. 'First and foremost, she's a mom.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Chris said when Lori was diagnosed with brain cancer, doctors told her she had two choices - to fight it and possibly survive another year, or be made comfortable for the remainder of her time she had left. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She wanted to fight it,' Chris said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Chris said Lori's diagnosis came after he noticed she was 'getting more clumsy', and would accidentally run into walls, stub her toe, and drop drinking glasses on a more regular basis - before her 'mouth started to droop a little bit... it became too much to ignore'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Tributes poured in for Lori following news of her passing as she became a symbol of hope and resilience for many across America &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He added at the time, three weeks before Lori passed away: 'Everything we do is not to save her life, it’s to keep her alive as long as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I started mourning the loss of my wife the day she got diagnosed. I didn’t have a lot of hope at the outset – and that weighed heavily on me. I was really upset, mad, angry. How could this be happening to us again?' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He recalled that after her first brain surgery, Lori told him: 'This isn't going to take me down. I'm not done.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She wants to be a grandma. She wants to be there when her kids graduate. She wants her life that she’s built so beautifully,' he said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But a second surgery was more complicated, and resulted in Lori losing motor control on her left side. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There were a lot of people in the hospital that were really pulling for her,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lori tragically went downhill following the surgery, and by mid-November she suffered a brain infection, which was followed by an infection in her lungs and pneumonia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I would give my life for hers in a heartbeat. But I can't do that. I'm helpless,' he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 14:27:56 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxPSFdtZkJYSUFCNE9jSEFyWDRBOHhfSHlxb2dMSmlUX2NoMjBqdTJMZS0wR1hSOGdpN3JZRDNaWTFsWURXOFFBb3lFZjRfVHYtN3M1aFRXcTUyRndHVzVBTHNSQXF4OUVRclFUcHlPOTFhNlluU2V3WEZ4VUtOaWRKSUFYTmpxcldDc2FDZ0JvWnAtckpxdDdwblpycjZIRWw1X3pkam130gGrAUFVX3lxTFBoQ1QyRXFHX3VDV1NyYnpxbi1RZzdzUHJnQ1dLUDRvODktTUZ1MVpNMjFSZ3k4aGtTNXNzVTh1UGxyZjE3QTYtSkdFMkNQb0JzdzBaM21rZ3JGWjFGanZhUHozUmk0NVZUU2dtcUs2QkpqeEdYMVZNbE1lQVlIVmY1T1kwRUx5dU00UkJlUElxSVQyb3I5TFNMdHVQY3RXM0NIR3ZVaGJaZ212MA</guid></item><item><title>两天的燕麦片可以降低胆固醇水平- Medical Xpress</title><link>https://medicalxpress.com/news/2026-01-days-oatmeal-cholesterol.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="success-screen" id="successScreen"&gt;

As it turns out, however, men getting more irritable as they get older probably shouldn't be excused as just a byproduct of aging. In fact, doctors are beginning to take notice and point out that it's not something to be glossed over as a stereotypical trope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Irritable male syndrome is so common among men that doctors are starting to take notice.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2026-01/irritable-male-syndrome-common-doctors-notice.png" alt="Man with irritable male syndrome" title="Doctors Are Beginning To Acknowledge Irritable Male Syndrome" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;New Africa | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/irritable-male-syndrome-ims-is-an-actual-condition-and-it-could-explain-a-lot-goog_l_696931bae4b09fa9c797ddc0" rel="nofollow"&gt;According to HuffPost&lt;/a&gt;, in 2001, Dr. Gerald Lincoln first used the term "irritable male syndrome" (IMS) to describe how a decrease in testosterone in sheep and rams correlated with "increased irritability and aggression." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychologists have since used his findings to identify similar mood changes in men who often have a natural drop in testosterone as they age. Basically, men go through a similar body and mind change as women, and just like with perimenopause and menopause, science is dragging its feet when it comes to exploring these aging changes and how they might impact mental health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/men/features/irritable-male-syndrome-high-on-stress"&gt;Abraham Morgentaler&lt;/a&gt;, MD, detailed, "They have a shorter fuse. In popular culture, people link male anger with high testosterone, but as a rule, we see it more in men with low testosterone — most commonly when levels are dropping. That’s when men get cranky." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/why-men-bad-telling-how-feel-according-research"&gt;Why Men Are So Bad At Telling You How They Feel, According To Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Irritable male syndrome isn't just characterized by testosterone loss.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="media media--type-image media--view-mode-default"&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-hidden field__item"&gt; &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.yourtango.com/sites/default/files/image_blog/2026-01/irritable-male-syndrome-not-just-testosterone-loss.png" alt="Man dealing with more than just testosterone loss associated with irritable male syndrome" title="Doctors Are Beginning To Acknowledge Irritable Male Syndrome" class="img-fluid" typeof="foaf:Image" decoding="async"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="field field--name-field-credit field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item"&gt;baranq | Shutterstock&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/irritable-male-syndrome-ims-is-an-actual-condition-and-it-could-explain-a-lot-goog_l_696931bae4b09fa9c797ddc0" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr. Justin Houman&lt;/a&gt; explained the symptoms of IMS to HuffPost as including "mood changes ... lower motivation and feelings of depression, difficulty concentrating or memory lapses, low energy and fatigue, reduced libido, [erectile dysfunction,] loss of muscle mass and strength, increased body fat, and sleep disturbances." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not happening overnight, these fluctuations creep up on men in the same way age takes away the keen eyesight a person had in their youth. It's a slow change. Many are calling the condition male menopause, but just as women shouldn't have to share gender specific medical conditions, neither should men. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age and life stressors carry a lot of weight and influence on the physical body and psyche. Therefore, life takes a toll on people, no matter the gender. It can't be avoided, neglected, or repressed when men's issues are valid to feel and talk about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/love/insecurities-men-hide-wives-afraid-be-seen"&gt;3 Insecurities Most Men Hide From Their Wives Because They're Afraid To Be Seen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Having lowered testosterone has become stigmatized, making men reluctant to talk to their doctors about the changes they experience.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shedding light on irritable male syndrome is integral to improving the health and wellness of men in middle age, which is why podcaster &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/israel.cassol/"&gt;Israel Cassol&lt;/a&gt; is using his platform to talk about his own struggles. He told the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/10/29/influencer-40-wants-acknowledgment-of-male-menopause/"&gt;New York Post&lt;/a&gt;, "Men shouldn’t see this as a weakness or something shameful. It’s a natural part of life for many, and talking about it helps break the stigma around men’s emotional health." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's vulnerable to admit and accept a diagnosis from any doctor, especially a diagnosis that tells you this is all a part of aging, and simultaneously is looked at societally as somehow emasculating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/testosterone--what-it-does-and-doesnt-do" rel="nofollow"&gt;Harvard Health&lt;/a&gt; noted,  "More than a third of men over age 45 may have reduced levels of testosterone than might be considered normal (though, as mentioned, defining optimal levels of testosterone is tricky and somewhat controversial)." In a nutshell, IMS is more common than we think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The easy way out of this depletion is to start testosterone therapy to bring T back up to a "normal" level. However, as the &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/mens-health/in-depth/male-menopause/art-20048056" rel="nofollow"&gt;Mayo Clinic&lt;/a&gt; noted, it's a decision to make after seeing a doctor and doing a full screening. More importantly, this is a health issue that deserves more attention and more research. Remember the years when hormone replacement therapy was controversial for women? Even now, it's still hard for many middle-aged women to be properly diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IMS is much more than just being grumpy. It adds an important layer to the conversation of mental health for men, something that is still woefully disregarded. Being aware that this happens to many both reassures and validates men troubled with identity and body issues that everyone experiences to various degrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="article-body-related-links"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RELATED: &lt;a href="/self/annoying-reason-men-cant-multitask-according-science"&gt;The Annoying Reason Men Can Only Seem To Do One Thing At A Time, According To Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emi Magaña is a writer from Los Angeles with a bachelor's in English.

I also wanted to birth a new life that I thought would redeem my old, a life beautiful enough to motivate me to keep going in the face of psychosis. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;According to combined national survey data collected by the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration from 2008 to 2014,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://answers.childrenshospital.org/parent-mental-illness/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="18% of parents in the U.S." data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69600683e4b07c21634e0510" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://answers.childrenshospital.org/parent-mental-illness/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;18% of parents in the U.S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; had experienced a mental health condition in the previous year. I have schizoaffective disorder, and though I’d been stable for four years, I felt compelled to be completely honest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Yeah,” I said. “I have no idea how many there have been. Multiple.” The attempts blur together in my mind. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tim reached for my hand. I clutched his. The resident’s steel eyes seemed to saw through my skull. “Have you ever had strong beliefs that other people said didn’t make sense?” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Five years ago,” I replied. “I’d stopped my antipsychotic cold turkey because I hated the weight gain.” I did my best to describe the delusions that had traumatized me. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“You thought you were being recruited by the CIA?” the resident asked. “And your dad was a criminal mastermind trying to kill you?”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Yes.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;I sound batshit crazy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’d been shattered by psychosis— how could I ever be whole enough to bring a child into the world? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The supervising psychiatrist entered. We discussed how I’d resumed the antipsychotic medication, how it had stabilized me and made my happy, healthy life possible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Ma’am, I have a duty to say this,” the doctor said, his brown eyes gentle in a way the resident’s hadn’t been. “Very little is known about this medication in pregnancy.” But, he added, “It seems to cause miscarriages in rats.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Like many antipsychotics, my medication, one of the second generation of atypical antipsychotics developed after the initial discovery of Haldol and Thorazine in the 1950s, hadn’t been well studied in pregnancy, he said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11695384/#:~:text=Preterm%20birth.,an%20antipsychotic%20drug%20in%20pregnancy.&amp;amp;text=NR-,Spontaneous%20abortion.,likely%20due%20to%20confounding%20factors.&amp;amp;text=Miscarriage.,Further%20research%20is%20recommended.&amp;amp;text=The%20postpartum%20follow%2Dup%20was,and%20fetal%20echocardiography%2C%20were%20performed." role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Some research" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69600683e4b07c21634e0510" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11695384/#:~:text=Preterm%20birth.,an%20antipsychotic%20drug%20in%20pregnancy.&amp;amp;text=NR-,Spontaneous%20abortion.,likely%20due%20to%20confounding%20factors.&amp;amp;text=Miscarriage.,Further%20research%20is%20recommended.&amp;amp;text=The%20postpartum%20follow%2Dup%20was,and%20fetal%20echocardiography%2C%20were%20performed." data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some research&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; links atypical antipsychotics to miscarriage; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39234854/#:~:text=The%20adjusted%20odds%20ratios%20(aOR,and%20the%20risk%20of%20miscarriage." role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="other studies" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69600683e4b07c21634e0510" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39234854/#:~:text=The%20adjusted%20odds%20ratios%20(aOR,and%20the%20risk%20of%20miscarriage." data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;&lt;span&gt;other studies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; find no risk. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;For me — as for so many women — the dangers of stopping the medication outweighed any potential risk to a baby, he told us. Pregnancy with a psychotic disorder isn’t just complicated by the illness itself, but by the gaps in care and the lifestyle challenges that so often come with it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S295028532300011X#:~:text=Other%20psychosocial%20studies%20have%20supported,24" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="I faced heightened odds " data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69600683e4b07c21634e0510" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S295028532300011X#:~:text=Other%20psychosocial%20studies%20have%20supported,24" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;&lt;span&gt;I faced heightened odds &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;of developing gestational diabetes, having a preterm birth or delivering an infant with low birth weight.

Tim rubbed my back. His touch couldn’t comfort me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The psychiatrist threw his hands wide. “So many women in our hospital who are on these medications have beautiful babies. But there’s a risk.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I developed mental illness as a teenager and attempted suicide for the first time when I was 21. In the following years, I suffered breakdown after breakdown, until, at age 30, when I stopped my antipsychotic and spiraled into delusions, I received a new diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. My parents sought guardianship and moved me to a group home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But I was resilient. I became medication compliant, moved home and found volunteer work that transitioned into a job. I started running and competed in 5Ks. Seeing my progress, my parents eventually terminated the guardianship. Later, I earned a master’s degree and bought my first home. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I met Tim when I was 34. He was intelligent and funny, gentle and stable — and we fell head over heels for each other. With him, I hoped to start a family. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;During our engagement, on a bright spring day, the daffodils’ yellow stars strewn profusely across the lawn, I told my dad that Tim would make a good father. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“And you’d make a wonderful mom, honey,” he told me. “I wouldn’t have said that even two or three years ago, but you’ve proven me wrong. I couldn’t be happier.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure class="cli cli-image js-no-inject"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-image__spacer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-image__source-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="cli-image__caption caption-cli"&gt;The author and her husband pictured during their engagement in 2018.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Of course, I worried about passing on my illness. Children of parents with severe mental illnesses have a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3885302/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="1 in 3 chance" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69600683e4b07c21634e0510" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3885302/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;1 in 3 chance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; of developing a psychotic or major mood disorder by adulthood. Schizoaffective disorder manifests in late adolescence, so I wouldn’t know for nearly two decades whether I had passed on my condition. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tim and I discussed the possibility that sleep deprivation and stress might cause me to destabilize. We also talked about the long-term implications if I required hospitalization during our child’s formative years. Tim once said to me, “I’m scared I’ll have to take care of two people — you and a baby.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I knew support would be crucial. I investigated doulas and child care and enlisted a commitment to help from my parents. I planned to leave my full-time job and work part-time from home. I also took comfort from the examples of friends with mental and physical disabilities who were wonderful parents. They told me that parenting was both the hardest thing they’d ever done and the most rewarding. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Research demonstrates that even people with conditions as serious as mine can make great parents. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/about/policy/parents-disabilities.pdf" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="An eight-year study" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69600683e4b07c21634e0510" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.apa.org/about/policy/parents-disabilities.pdf" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="6"&gt;&lt;span&gt;An eight-year study&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; cited by the American Psychological Association found that the adult children of parents with various disabilities generally showed high self-esteem and had positive childhood experiences. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the clinic, the specialist outlined a plan: I’d gradually taper off several of my medications to prepare my body for pregnancy, while remaining on the vital antipsychotic.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Later, back in our apartment, Tim and I talked and talked, weighing the potential risk to my mental health, as well as the risk of miscarriage. We decided to go for it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In April 2020, after the first taper had begun, I found myself sobbing over the sweet potatoes I was slicing for dinner. I could only think of lying down and letting an overdose-induced sleep close over my head forever. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Once again, I willed my own death. But this time, I fought. In what has been my only hospitalization in the past nine years, I checked myself into a local behavioral health unit and sobbed myself to sleep. Knowing that I desperately needed to stabilize, I resumed the medication. At that point, I was in no shape to become a mom. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote class="cli cli-pullquote"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__placeholder"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="cli-pullquote__content"&gt;&lt;p class="cli-pullquote__quote accent-cli"&gt;“Tim once said to me, ‘I’m scared I’ll have to take care of two people — you and a baby.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the years that followed, I researched adoption from foster care and domestic infant adoption. Tim and I attended orientations, and I made endless cold calls to adoption agencies to ask if they would consider facilitating an adoption by a woman with a history of psychiatric hospitalization. Receptionists hung up. I became more strategic. They still hung up. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally, on a late autumn afternoon in 2024, a social worker leveled with me: My severe psychiatric history meant that no agency would adopt to us, despite my years of stability. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The reproductive health needs of women with severe mental illnesses are complex and still &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7971324/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="largely go unmet" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69600683e4b07c21634e0510" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7971324/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="7"&gt;&lt;span&gt;largely go unmet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;But we’re not the only ones for whom the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;need for reproductive psychiatry is pressing.

Not even the antipsychotic, though its effects on pregnancy remained mysterious. I made an appointment to get my IUD removed. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;By early spring, I felt nauseous. My stomach cramped so badly I clutched a heating pad. My breasts grew larger, and the nipples changed color. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It was too soon for a pregnancy test. Still, my primary care doctor said it was possible to have all these symptoms at such an early stage of pregnancy. I was excited. At home, I smiled into Tim’s eyes: “I think you’re going to become a dad.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Days later, my period started. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was sure I had been pregnant. But as the days passed, I worried how I would react if I miscarried again. Could I handle more loss? Or would I spiral until I lost myself? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Throughout that winter and early spring, I’d had nightmares that I gave birth to a child with a psychotic disorder or landed myself back in a psychiatric inpatient unit. I wanted to be brave enough to go out and grab the beautiful life I craved, but deep down, I was terrified.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I reflected on the miracle that Tim and I already shared a happy, stable home. And I was healthy. My mom said to me, during one of the long phone conversations we had that spring, “Meggie, you can choose wellness.” &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I valued my health even more than my dream of motherhood, I realized. I &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;could&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; choose my own wellness — and wellness would make attaining other dreams possible.

On a recent family vacation, I stacked alphabet blocks with my 4-year-old niece, my twin brother’s daughter, into words she read aloud: “car,” “balloon,” “banana.” Her 18-month-old brother bumped a toy truck against my shin. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;Vroom, vroom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.

But it also sings. Most times, I take joy in my gorgeously good little life: me, my husband, our brood of rescue kitties. As time goes on, its goodness only grows. Where I once wished for death, I found a desire to live. I gave up my hope of having a baby, but still created the beautiful life I’d dreamed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you or someone you know needs help, call or text 988 or chat &lt;a href="https://988lifeline.org/chat/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="988lifeline.org" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="69600683e4b07c21634e0510" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://988lifeline.org/chat/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="11"&gt;988lifeline.org&lt;/a&gt; for mental health support.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Magnesium is a mineral that fights inflammation by protecting against oxidative stress. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It also prevents inflammation linked to diabetes and post-exercise muscle recovery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top sources include pumpkin seeds, chia seeds, spinach, nuts, black beans and edamame.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Inflammation is like a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it is a normal immune response that helps your body recover from injury, infection, intense exercise or even ongoing stress. However, problems arise when that inflammatory response stays elevated. When inflammation becomes chronic, it can lead to illnesses, such as &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7894073/these-7-things-could-make-you-more-likely-to-get-heart-disease-according-to-the-american-heart-association/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;heart disease&lt;/a&gt;, cancer, diabetes and dementia, to name a few.&lt;span data-cite="1" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; One nutrient that we don’t hear about very often that can help fight inflammation is magnesium. This mineral plays a role in immune and metabolic regulation, and research has linked better &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/signs-youre-not-getting-enough-magnesium-11740104" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium status&lt;/a&gt; with lower markers of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP).&lt;span data-cite="2" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span data-cite="3" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; In this article, we’ll look at magnesium’s role in inflammation and the best foods to give you the magnesium you need.

&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Prevents Cells from Releasing Inflammatory Compounds &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Research has found a link between low magnesium status and inflammation.&lt;span data-cite="4" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Conversely, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-benefits-11836271" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;adequate magnesium&lt;/a&gt; may protect against inflammation, says &lt;a href="https://serenaprattnutrition.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="2" rel="nofollow"&gt;Serena Pratt, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;. One way it may do this is by moderating the movement of calcium into your cells to keep cellular calcium levels stable. That’s important because having too much calcium in your cells can trigger the release of inflammatory compounds throughout your body. It can even spell trouble for your brain, increasing the risk of neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;span data-cite="5" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; By making sure you have plenty of magnesium on board, you can help prevent your cells from flooding your body with harmful inflammatory compounds.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It May Protect Against Oxidative Stress &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When magnesium status is chronically low, “the body may be more prone to oxidative stress and upregulate inflammatory pathways,” says Pratt. Over time, this may increase levels of inflammatory compounds called cytokines, which may increase blood markers of inflammation, like CRP, she says. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For instance, research comparing magnesium intake with a placebo found that people who took a magnesium supplement were able to &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/supplements-you-shouldnt-take-if-you-have-inflammation-11724536" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;reduce their CRP levels&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting lower levels of inflammation.&lt;span data-cite="6" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It May Help Protect Against Diabetes &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Diabetes has many causes, and one of them is inflammation. “When magnesium status is adequate, it supports insulin function and the body’s response to stress,” says &lt;a href="https://inutritioncenter.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Vanessa Imus, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span data-cite="7" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, better insulin sensitivity isn’t the only way magnesium may protect against diabetes. Remember how magnesium helps keep cellular calcium levels in check? As it turns out, this inflammation-lowering mechanism also promotes &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/lifestyle-tweaks-healthy-blood-sugar-levels-11792895" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;healthy blood sugar levels&lt;/a&gt;. And that’s not all. It may also help prevent high blood pressure, &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7893923/habits-to-break-to-lower-cholesterol/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;high cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, overweight and obesity.&lt;span data-cite="8" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; It Can Support Muscle Recovery &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Exercise can do lots of good things for your body. But when you work out long and hard, it can lead to more inflammation.&lt;span data-cite="9" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span data-cite="10" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; At the same time, “low [magnesium] levels can make recovery less efficient,” says &lt;a href="https://www.harriswholehealth.com/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Cheryl Harris, M.P.H., RD&lt;/a&gt;, increasing the chance that inflammation remains elevated. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; On the flip side, research has found that consuming adequate magnesium may help support &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/benefits-of-gaining-muscle-mass-11750809" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;muscle mass&lt;/a&gt;, increase muscle power and improve overall performance.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most healthy adults need about &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-magnesium-rich-foods-11772823" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;420 milligrams of magnesium per day&lt;/a&gt;. However, many of us don’t consume enough of this &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/the-top-nutrients-to-fight-inflammation-8675325" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;anti-inflammatory mineral&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;span data-cite="11" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The best ways to get the magnesium you need are from plant foods, especially pumpkin and chia seeds, which provide more than a quarter of the Daily Value per ounce.&lt;span data-cite="12" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Other good sources of magnesium include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Almonds&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cashews&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Peanuts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spinach&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Soy milk&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Black beans&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Edamame&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole-wheat cereal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brown rice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Baked potatoes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_40-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Rather than focusing on one or two foods, an easy way to get the magnesium you need is to eat a wide variety of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/magnesium-rich-snack-recipes-11823332" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;magnesium-rich foods&lt;/a&gt; throughout the day. This might look like adding pumpkin or chia seeds to yogurt or oatmeal, building a meal around brown rice and spinach, or choosing shredded wheat cereal at breakfast.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Magnesium is one nutrient that can help fight inflammation, but it’s not the only one. Other nutrients that help protect against inflammation include:

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_45-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vitamin C:&lt;/strong&gt; Supports antioxidant defenses that help reduce oxidative stress.

It also plays a surprising role in immune regulation. Yet, it’s only in a handful of foods, such as fatty fish, fortified dairy foods and eggs. If you don’t eat these foods frequently, ask your health care provider if a supplement is right for you.&lt;span data-cite="14" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Omega-3 fatty acids:&lt;/strong&gt; Most of us don’t consume nearly enough of these anti-inflammatory fats. The best sources are fatty fish, like salmon, mackerel, anchovies, sardines and herring. If you don’t eat these, you can also find plant omega-3s in flaxseed, chia seeds and walnuts.&lt;span data-cite="15" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polyphenols:&lt;/strong&gt; While they’re not nutrients, per se, polyphenols are antioxidants with potent anti-inflammatory powers. You can get them from berries, olive oil, coffee, tea and many colorful vegetables.&lt;span data-cite="16" class="inline-citation-node"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_50-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Unchecked chronic inflammation can lead to the development of many illnesses, such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes and dementia. Magnesium can help. This mineral protects against inflammation by preventing your cells from releasing &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-flavonol-rich-foods-11783068" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;anti-inflammatory compounds&lt;/a&gt; and by protecting against oxidative stress. Magnesium also helps fend off inflammation that can lead to diabetes or impair post-exercise muscle recovery.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Of course, preventing inflammation isn’t about eating one nutrient. Magnesium works best as part of an &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7938737/top-healthy-eating-habits-according-to-a-dietitian/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;overall healthy eating pattern&lt;/a&gt;. To get your fill, reach for foods like pumpkin seeds, chia seeds, spinach and nuts. And don’t forget other inflammation fighters, like omega-3 fats, antioxidants and vitamins C and D. Together they offer a powerful cocktail of &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link-ai" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-foods-to-fight-inflammation-11762781" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="2"&gt;inflammation-fighting nutrition&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;A new sprayable powder developed by researchers at &lt;em&gt;KAIST&lt;/em&gt; can stop bleeding in just one second by transforming into a wound-sealing hydrogel upon contact with blood. The material, called &lt;strong&gt;AGCL&lt;/strong&gt;, is designed for battlefield conditions and can effectively seal deep or irregular wounds, even under extreme humidity or heat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The innovation marks a potential shift in how military and emergency teams manage traumatic injuries, especially in prehospital settings where rapid blood loss is the leading cause of potentially preventable deaths. AGCL is composed entirely of naturally derived ingredients and works through an ionic gelation process triggered by calcium in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combat Bleeding Remains the Top Killer, and a Tricky One&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of military medical advances, &lt;strong&gt;hemorrhage &lt;/strong&gt;is still the number one cause of potentially survivable deaths in combat zones. According to a consensus &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9323555/#:~:text=BACKGROUND,modalities%20in%20combat%20casualty%20care." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;study &lt;/a&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery&lt;/em&gt;, most fatalities from bleeding occur before a casualty reaches a medical treatment facility. Deep, non-compressible wounds (like those to the abdomen or junctional areas) are particularly difficult to manage, and often impossible to treat effectively with current gauze or patch solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The problem lies not just in how wounds bleed, but in how unpredictable their geometry can be. “&lt;em&gt;Until now, patch-type hemostatic agents widely used in medical fields have had limitations in application to deep and complex wounds due to their flat structure&lt;/em&gt;,” stated researchers from &lt;em&gt;KAIST&lt;/em&gt;, as reported in &lt;em&gt;Advanced Functional Materials&lt;/em&gt;. Moreover, most current agents lose effectiveness under harsh environmental conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/agcl-powder-fabrication-gelation-mechanism-and-performance-vs-other-hemostats-advanced-functional-materials-1200x727.jpg" alt="Agcl Powder Fabrication, Gelation Mechanism, And Performance Vs.

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ultrafast Gelation Activated by Blood Contact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The AGCL powder stands out by combining speed, adaptability, and storage resilience. Made from &lt;strong&gt;alginate&lt;/strong&gt; (a brown seaweed extract), &lt;strong&gt;gellan gum&lt;/strong&gt; (a bacterial thickener), and &lt;strong&gt;chitosan&lt;/strong&gt; (a biopolymer from crustaceans), the powder instantly turns into a gel upon contacting &lt;a href="https://indiandefencereview.com/blood-test-can-track-junk-food-consumption/" data-type="post" data-id="81994"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt;, specifically when it detects calcium ions. According to KAIST researchers, the gel forms in&lt;strong&gt;just one second&lt;/strong&gt;, rapidly sealing the wound, regardless of its shape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But AGCL doesn’t just block blood. The chitosan component, which carries a positive charge, binds with negatively charged red blood cells and platelets,&lt;strong&gt; helping them cluster&lt;/strong&gt; and form a stable clot. In mechanical tests, AGCL demonstrated an adhesive strength of over&lt;strong&gt; 40 kPa&lt;/strong&gt;, enough to withstand pressure similar to being pressed by hand. It can also absorb more than seven times its own weight in blood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In comparison trials using a mouse liver injury model, AGCL significantly outperformed &lt;strong&gt;TachoSil&lt;/strong&gt;, a benchmark commercial product. Not only did it control bleeding faster, but liver function in mice returned to normal two weeks after treatment, highlighting its regenerative potential.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/agcl-powder-shows-superior-bleeding-control-and-healing-in-mouse-liver-injury-modeladvanced-functional-materials-1200x727.jpg" alt="Agcl Powder Shows Superior Bleeding Control And Healing In Mouse Liver Injury Model©advanced Functional Materials" class="wp-image-104885" srcset="https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/agcl-powder-shows-superior-bleeding-control-and-healing-in-mouse-liver-injury-modeladvanced-functional-materials-scaled.jpg 1200w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/agcl-powder-shows-superior-bleeding-control-and-healing-in-mouse-liver-injury-modeladvanced-functional-materials-420x255.jpg 420w, https://indiandefencereview.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/agcl-powder-shows-superior-bleeding-control-and-healing-in-mouse-liver-injury-modeladvanced-functional-materials-520x315.jpg 520w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AGCL powder shows superior bleeding control and healing in mouse liver injury model©Advanced Functional Materials&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Durable, Antibacterial, and Ready for the Field&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to fast action, AGCL is engineered for real-world durability. It can remain effective for &lt;strong&gt;two years at room temperature&lt;/strong&gt;, even in high humidity, making it ideal for military deployment or disaster relief zones where refrigeration is unavailable. “&lt;em&gt;This technology reached a high level of perfection as a practical technology considering real combat environments&lt;/em&gt;,” reported the &lt;em&gt;KAIST&lt;/em&gt; research team, which included an Army Major among its members.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Safety was another key focus. AGCL showed over 99% cell viability and 99.9% antibacterial efficacy in lab tests. Its low hemolysis rate (&amp;lt;3%) and compatibility with living tissue make it safe even for internal wounds. Importantly, animal trials revealed no signs of systemic toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These properties position AGCL as not only a &lt;strong&gt;bleeding control solution&lt;/strong&gt; but a multifunctional wound care material. In the same murine studies, the powder not only stopped bleeding but accelerated re-epithelialization, angiogenesis, and collagen deposition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Shift toward Broader Military Medical Capability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a separate Delphi consensus involving 32 military trauma experts from 10 countries, there was strong agreement that noninvasive bleeding control tools (like powders) should be available at &lt;strong&gt;all levels of care&lt;/strong&gt;, from point-of-injury to higher-level surgical facilities. According to the study published in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery&lt;/em&gt;, experts called for international collaboration on bleeding control protocols, training, and registries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ph.D. candidate &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Kyusoon-Park-2000716758" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyusoon Park&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an Army Major involved in the AGCL development, underscored the broader mission behind the project: &lt;em&gt;“I started the research with a sense of mission to save even one more soldier&lt;/em&gt;,” he said. “&lt;em&gt;I hope this technology will be used as a life-saving technology in both national defense and private medical fields&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Published in &lt;em&gt;Advanced Functional Materials&lt;/em&gt;, the AGCL study confirms the growing push for deployable, reliable bleeding control systems. With combat medicine moving closer to the point of injury, tools like AGCL could soon become standard in the kits of soldiers and first responders worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If you have ever lifted a weight, you know the routine: challenge the muscle, give it rest, feed it and repeat. Over time, it grows stronger. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, muscles only &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1249/MSS.0b013e3181915670"&gt;grow when the challenge increases over time&lt;/a&gt;. Continually lifting the same weight the same way stops working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It might come as a surprise to learn that the brain responds to training in much the same way as our muscles, even though most of us never think about it that way. Clear thinking, focus, creativity and good judgment are built through challenge, when the brain is asked to stretch beyond routine rather than run on autopilot. That slight mental discomfort is often the sign that the brain is actually being trained, a lot like that good workout burn in your muscles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about walking the same loop through a local park every day. At first, your senses are alert. You notice the hills, the trees, the changing light. But after a few loops, your brain checks out. You start planning dinner, replaying emails or running through your to-do list. The walk still feels good, but your brain is no longer being challenged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Routine feels comfortable, but comfort and familiarity alone do not build new brain connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sTqquL0AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;neurologist&lt;/a&gt; who studies brain activity, I use &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.11.052"&gt;electroencephalograms&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/a-century-after-the-eeg-was-discovered-it-remains-a-crucial-tool-for-understanding-the-brain-213843"&gt;EEGs&lt;/a&gt;, to record the brain’s electrical patterns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Research in humans shows that these rhythms are remarkably dynamic. When someone learns a new skill, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1820296116"&gt;EEG rhythms often become more organized and coordinated&lt;/a&gt;. This reflects the brain’s attempt to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0402820101"&gt;strengthen pathways needed for that skill&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Your brain trains in zones too&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For decades, scientists believed that the brain’s ability to grow and reorganize, called &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1155/2014/541870"&gt;neuroplasticity&lt;/a&gt;, was largely limited to childhood. Once the brain matured, its wiring was thought to be largely fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that idea has been overturned. Decades of research show that adult &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41583-021-00433-z"&gt;brains can form new connections&lt;/a&gt; and reorganize existing networks, under the right conditions, throughout life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the most influential work in this field comes from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2018.04.007"&gt;enriched environment studies in animals&lt;/a&gt;. Rats housed in stimulating environments filled with toys, running wheels and social interaction developed &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0053888"&gt;larger, more complex brains than rats kept in standard cages&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2005.04.009"&gt;Their brains adapted&lt;/a&gt; because they were regularly exposed to novelty and challenge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Human studies find similar results. Adults who take on genuinely new challenges, such as &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2025.1663218"&gt;learning a language&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2018.12.010"&gt;dancing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-13416-2"&gt;practicing a musical instrument&lt;/a&gt;, show measurable &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2025.1663218"&gt;increases in brain volume and connectivity&lt;/a&gt; on MRI scans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The takeaway is simple: Repetition keeps the brain running, but &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2020.00076"&gt;novelty pushes the brain to adapt&lt;/a&gt;, forcing it to pay attention, learn and problem-solve in new ways. Neuroplasticity thrives when the brain is nudged just beyond its comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/714012/original/file-20260122-56-rk8twa.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Tasks that stretch your brain just beyond its comfort zone, such as knitting and crocheting, can improve cognitive abilities over your lifespan – and doing them in a group setting brings an additional bonus for overall health.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/knitting-group-royalty-free-image/1977315544?phrase=knitting%20health&amp;amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;amp;adppopup=true"&gt;Dougal Waters/DigitalVision via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The reality of neural fatigue&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like muscles, the brain has limits. It does not get stronger from endless strain. Real growth comes from the right balance of challenge and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the brain is pushed for too long without a break – whether that means long work hours, staying locked onto the same task or making nonstop decisions under pressure – performance starts to slip. Focus fades. Mistakes increase. To keep you going, the brain shifts how different regions work together, asking some areas to carry more of the load. But that extra effort can still &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0329212"&gt;make the whole network run less smoothly&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neural fatigue is more than feeling tired. Brain imaging studies show that during prolonged mental work, the networks responsible for attention and decision-making &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-78768-3"&gt;begin to slow down&lt;/a&gt;, while regions that promote &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119812"&gt;rest and reward-seeking take over&lt;/a&gt;. This shift helps explain why mental exhaustion often comes with &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/sleep-loss-rewires-the-brain-for-cravings-and-weight-gain-a-neurologist-explains-the-science-behind-the-cycle-255726?utm_medium=article_clipboard_share&amp;amp;utm_source=theconversation.com"&gt;stronger cravings for quick rewards&lt;/a&gt;, like sugary snacks, comfort foods or mindless scrolling. The result is familiar: slower thinking, more mistakes, irritability and mental fog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the muscle analogy becomes especially useful. You wouldn’t do squats for six hours straight, because your leg muscles would eventually give out. As they work, they build up &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpregu.00114.2004"&gt;byproducts that make each contraction a little less effective&lt;/a&gt; until you finally have to stop. Your brain behaves in a similar way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, in the brain, when the same cognitive circuits are overused, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2022.07.010"&gt;chemical signals build up&lt;/a&gt;, communication slows and learning stalls. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But rest allows those strained circuits to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsycho.2021.108076"&gt;reset and function more smoothly over time&lt;/a&gt;. And taking &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsaa143"&gt;breaks from a taxing activity does not interrupt learning&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, breaks are critical for efficient learning.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;Overdoing any task, whether it be weight training or sitting at the computer for too long, can overtax the muscles as well as the brain.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/businesswoman-has-stiffness-in-neck-and-shoulders-royalty-free-image/2137509949?phrase=overworking%20the%20muscles&amp;amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;amp;adppopup=true"&gt;Halfpoint Images/Moment via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The crucial importance of rest&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among all forms of rest, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1161/STR.0000000000000453"&gt;sleep is the most powerful&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleep is the brain’s night shift. While you rest, the brain takes out the trash through a special cleanup system called the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1474-4422(18)30318-1"&gt;glymphatic system&lt;/a&gt; that clears away waste and harmful proteins. Sleep also &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.smrv.2021.101449"&gt;restores glycogen&lt;/a&gt;, a critical fuel source for brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And importantly, sleep is when essential repair work happens. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.5.2S.S6"&gt;Growth hormone surges during deep sleep&lt;/a&gt;, supporting tissue repair. &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00424-011-1044-0"&gt;Immune cells regroup&lt;/a&gt; and strengthen their activity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During &lt;a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/public-education/brain-basics/brain-basics-understanding-sleep"&gt;REM sleep&lt;/a&gt;, the stage of sleep linked to dreaming, the brain replays patterns from the day to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11910-013-0430-8"&gt;consolidate memories&lt;/a&gt;. This process is critical not only for cognitive skills like learning an instrument but also for physical skills like mastering a move in sports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, chronic sleep deprivation &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1706694115"&gt;impairs attention&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5665/sleep.4668"&gt;disrupts decision-making&lt;/a&gt; and alters the hormones that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23616"&gt;regulate appetite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2018.02.010"&gt;metabolism&lt;/a&gt;. This is why fatigue drives &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2869.2008.00662.x"&gt;sugar cravings and late-night snacking&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sleep is not an optional wellness practice. It is a biological requirement for brain performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Exercise feeds the brain too&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-023-03492-8"&gt;Exercise strengthens the brain&lt;/a&gt; as well as the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physical activity &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41574-019-0174-x"&gt;increases levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF&lt;/a&gt;, a protein that acts like fertilizer for neurons. It promotes the growth of new connections, increases blood flow, reduces inflammation and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-023-03492-8"&gt;helps the brain remain adaptable across one’s lifespan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why exercise is one of the strongest &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)00184-9"&gt;lifestyle tools for protecting cognitive health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Train, recover, repeat&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important lesson from this science is simple. Your brain is not passively wearing down with age. It is constantly remodeling itself in response to how you use it. Every new challenge and skill you try, every real break, every good night of sleep sends a signal that growth is still expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You do not need expensive brain training programs or radical lifestyle changes. Small, consistent habits matter more. Try something unfamiliar. Vary your routines. Take breaks before exhaustion sets in. Move your body. Treat sleep as nonnegotiable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the next time you lace up your shoes for a familiar walk, consider taking a different path. The scenery may change only slightly, but your brain will notice. That small detour is often all it takes to turn routine into training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brain stays adaptable throughout life. Cognitive resilience is not fixed at birth or locked in early adulthood. It is something you can shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want a sharper, more creative, more resilient brain, you do not need to wait for a breakthrough drug or a perfect moment. You can start now, with choices that tell your brain that growth is still the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

        

        
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Conversation</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 13:45:39 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0wFBVV95cUxPeWRyT3ZBX1RqZUVqX2xLR3huaXhZNmpaYXhkY3lJcXdmZm5SMEdIZmMzakw4VGphQk9JUVRraWlvX1RMV2dfdEE3WUdodW9hU2lDQk45OFRkVll6UUhVb1JmYjduc1J4R3BmRko3aG4wZ28yRGVfdTFpZTZEVWx2VU1BblhWUXRCZFJ5VkVqd0theG5vV1pnWi1sM2pmakFYb1BKcElGNFZOY1p5bHhrNV9mNnBuUzUyOTJPUVdHU1ctdkYxZDlTV3ZGdXlVdnYzcnVB</guid></item><item><title>类风湿性关节炎无法治愈–但研究人员正在努力预防它-对话</title><link>https://theconversation.com/rheumatoid-arthritis-has-no-cure-but-researchers-are-homing-in-on-preventing-it-268472</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="grid-ten large-grid-nine grid-last content-body content entry-content instapaper_body inline-promos" itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;More than &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rheumatoid-arthritis"&gt;18 million people worldwide&lt;/a&gt; suffer from &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmra2103726"&gt;rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/new-yale-study-reveals-mechanism-behind-persistent-autoimmune-joint-destruction/"&gt;nearly 1.5 million Americans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune, inflammatory form of arthritis, meaning a person’s immune system attacks their joints, causing substantial inflammation. This inflammation can cause pain, stiffness and swelling in the joints, and in many cases, patients report fatigue and a flu-like feeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If left untreated, rheumatoid arthritis can lead to damage of the joints. But even when treated, this condition can lead to significant disability. In highly active disease or advanced stages, patient may have difficulty performing daily tasks, such as preparing food, caring for children and getting dressed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to now, this condition has been treated once patients have already developed symptoms. But a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ard.2025.01.021"&gt;growing body of evidence&lt;/a&gt; suggests this disease &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.25.620344"&gt;can be identified earlier&lt;/a&gt; – and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/ard-2023-224211"&gt;maybe even ultimately prevented&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a physician specializing in rheumatoid arthritis and a &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hUh3u88AAAAJ&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;oi=ao"&gt;researcher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://medschool.cuanschutz.edu/centers/adpc/autoimmune-disease-prevention-center/research/stopra-national---for-participants"&gt;who has conducted a clinical trial&lt;/a&gt; on treatments for this condition. I believe this research is moving us toward being able to identify people who are at risk for rheumatoid arthritis before the disease fully develops, and to finding treatments that will delay or prevent it altogether. My hope is that this could lead to changes in how we manage rheumatoid arthritis in the next several years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Finding the disease before it causes harm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, when someone visits their health care provider because they are experiencing joint pain or other symptoms of an immune attack, health care providers can make a diagnosis by examining the joints for swelling. The health care provider will also run tests to find &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s12016-021-08890-1"&gt;blood markers called autoantibodies&lt;/a&gt;, which help in confirming the diagnosis. While not all people with rheumatoid arthritis will have abnormal blood markers, the two autoantibodies that are seen in up to 80% of people with rheumatoid arthritis are rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
            &lt;p class="placeholder-container"&gt;&lt;iframe class="native-lazy" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UFhAcF5yuw8?wmode=transparent&amp;amp;start=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;In addition to joint pain, rheumatoid arthritis affects a person’s entire immune system.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But multiple studies have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/ard-2023-224211"&gt;now confirmed that rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-220884"&gt;preclinical stage of development&lt;/a&gt;. This is a time about three to five years or longer, prior to the onset of swollen joints when markers like rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide are detectable in the blood. The presence of these markers indicates that autoimmunity is occurring, yet the body and organs are still functioning well, and a person who is at risk of getting rheumatoid arthritis may not feel sick yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that researchers have identified this preclinical stage, health care providers can use markers such as autoantibodies and symptoms like prolonged early morning joint stiffness to identify people who are at risk for rheumatoid arthritis but do not yet have joint inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, predicting future rheumatoid arthritis is &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/M23-0272"&gt;still in the research stage&lt;/a&gt;, although the field is working toward established ways to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ard.2025.01.021"&gt;test for risk for rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt; as a routine part of health care. This is akin to how cardiovascular disease risk is assessed through measuring cholesterol levels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ongoing research&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of advances in the ability to predict who may get rheumatoid arthritis in the future, researchers are now working on identifying treatments that can delay or prevent the full-blown condition from developing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/art.43366"&gt;trials have been performed&lt;/a&gt; in people who &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2017-212763"&gt;tested positive for anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide&lt;/a&gt;, or who have &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(22)01193-x"&gt;other risk factors&lt;/a&gt; for rheumatoid arthritis. These risk factors include joint pain and subclinical joint inflammation, which is when an imaging study, like magnetic resonance imaging, sees joint inflammation that can’t be seen by a clinician examining the joints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To date, almost all of these trials have used immune drugs that are commonly used to treat full-blown rheumatoid arthritis, such as &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/20143-methotrexate"&gt;methotrexate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/hydroxychloroquine-oral-route/description/drg-20064216"&gt;hydroxychloroquine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/19712-rituximab-injection"&gt;rituximab&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers have been testing whether a short course of any of these drugs could lead to a lasting reset of the immune system and prevent rheumatoid arthritis from developing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is not yet an approved drug for rheumatoid arthritis prevention, these studies offer hope that researchers are on track to find the right drug – as well as the right dosage and duration of that drug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Researching the preclinical stage of rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some challenges remain to be addressed before preventive treatments become the norm in clinical care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, researchers need to better understand the biology of the preclinical stage of disease. Until recently, most studies have focused on patients with full-blown arthritis and generally ignored people at risk for developing the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now, researchers can use blood markers like anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies to identify those who are at risk much more easily. And &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41584-024-01154-0"&gt;a growing number of studies&lt;/a&gt; of people with this marker &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2022.899372"&gt;are informing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/art.38273"&gt;how scientists understand&lt;/a&gt; the biology of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI185217"&gt;rheumatoid arthritis development&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, it is now apparent that the preclinical stage is marked by multiple circulating &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.adt7214"&gt;immune system abnormalities in cells&lt;/a&gt;, autoantibodies and inflammation. The hope is that researchers will find interventions that effectively target the immune system abnormalities driving the development of rheumatoid arthritis before the patient’s joints begin to swell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers are also finding that the abnormalities in the immune system during the preclinical stage may be coming from sites in the body other than the joints. An emerging idea called the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41584-024-01154-0"&gt;mucosal origins hypothesis&lt;/a&gt; posits that the early autoimmunity of rheumatoid arthritis is caused by inflammation at mucosal surfaces of the body, such as the gums, the lungs and the gut. According to this theory, the joints are involved only later as the disease progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More research is needed, but the mucosal origins hypothesis may help explain why &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms20184541"&gt;periodontal disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2005.09.053"&gt;emphysema or other forms of lung disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/art.43113"&gt;exposure to tobacco or forest fire smoke&lt;/a&gt; are risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis. It would also explain why &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.abn5166"&gt;certain bacteria&lt;/a&gt; have been &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm8111837"&gt;associated with the disease&lt;/a&gt;. Future trials targeting interventions to a mucosal process could help researchers better understand the nature of this disease. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="align-center zoomable"&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://images.theconversation.com/files/713517/original/file-20260120-66-sqmc3.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&amp;amp;q=45&amp;amp;auto=format&amp;amp;w=1000&amp;amp;fit=clip"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;figcaption&gt;
              &lt;span class="caption"&gt;At some point, testing for biomarkers of rheumatoid arthritis may become routine. For now, it can still be difficult for health care providers to determine which of their patients may be at risk for rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class="attribution"&gt;&lt;a class="source" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/photo/female-nurse-drawing-blood-sample-from-woman-in-royalty-free-image/2097577382?phrase=blood%20draw&amp;amp;searchscope=image%2Cfilm&amp;amp;adppopup=true"&gt;MoMo Productions/DigitalVision via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;/figcaption&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Making predictions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But while biomarkers like the anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies are strongly predictive for future rheumatoid arthritis, one difficulty remains: Some people who test positive for them never develop the full-blown disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that about 20% to 30% of people who are positive for anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2022.916277"&gt;develop rheumatoid arthritis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.7326/m23-0272"&gt;within two to five years&lt;/a&gt;, although the presence of combinations of risk factors can identify people who have a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/art.43218"&gt;greater than 50% risk&lt;/a&gt; for developing the condition within one year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes it difficult to find participants for clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis prevention. If you can’t predict who will get the disease, it’s hard to know whether you’re preventing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, researchers have tried to recruit people who have already come to their health care provider with early joint symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis but still no swollen joints. That has worked well, but there are likely far more people at risk for rheumatoid arthritis who have not yet sought care. Since health care providers are not yet testing everyone for blood markers for rheumatoid arthritis, researchers will need larger, international networks that can test for risk factors like autoantibodies to identify candidates for participation in prevention trials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More needs to be done, but it’s exciting to see the field advancing toward the point where prevention may be part of routine clinical care for rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;As we age, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/the-mere-sight-of-a-sick-person-can-trigger-our-immune-system"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; gradually declines in function, leaving the body more vulnerable to disease. Scientists have discovered a new way to rejuvenate a key component of immune function, potentially boosting health in later years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard focused on the thymus, a small organ in front of the heart that's crucial for the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprising-immune-cell-discovery-wins-2025-nobel-prize-heres-the-science"&gt;development of T cells&lt;/a&gt;. These immune cells act as guards, identifying and fighting threats such as  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="188377" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; and infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From early adulthood, the thymus shrinks and slows, limiting T cell production. In mouse models, the researchers were able to repurpose part of the liver as a thymus substitute, sending the molecular signals that stimulate T-cell production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/tattoos-affect-your-immune-system-in-ways-were-only-beginning-to-understand"&gt;Tattoos Affect Your Immune System in Ways We're Only Beginning to Understand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we get older, the immune system begins to decline," &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-study-suggests-way-rejuvenate-immune-system-1217"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; MIT neuroscientist Mirco Friedrich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We wanted to think about how can we maintain this kind of immune protection for a longer period of time, and that's what led us to think about what we can do to boost immunity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_188380" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188380" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/TCells.jpg" alt="Liver diagram" class="wp-image-188380 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/TCells.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/TCells-600x429.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-188380" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The researchers used the livers of the mice to stimulate T cell production. (Friedrich et al., &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the researchers compared the immune systems of young mice with old mice to identify three key signaling proteins that decline with age: DLL1, FLT3-L, and IL-7. These handle the jobs of turning cells into T cells and keeping those cells healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, an mRNA treatment package was assembled; mRNA (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messenger_RNA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;messenger ribonucleic acid&lt;/a&gt;) is like a set of instructions for protein production. This treatment was injected repeatedly into the livers of older mice, producing the desired signaling effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The liver is a high-output protein producer, even in old age. What's more, blood leaving the stomach and intestines must pass through the liver, and it's relatively easy to access for treatments like this, making it an ideal target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In older mice given the mRNA treatment for four weeks, there were notable increases in both the number and diversity of T cells. They responded more strongly to vaccinations and were better able to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/new-breakthrough-treatment-safely-kills-cancer-cells-with-light"&gt;fight off cancer tumors&lt;/a&gt; – signs of a boosted, younger, healthier immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/newsletter?utm_source=promo_generic_health"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg" alt="Subscribe to ScienceAlert's free fact-checked newsletter" class="alignnone wp-image-182810 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-642x273.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/11/Generic-Health-Promo-Final.jpg 850w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our approach is more of a synthetic approach," &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-study-suggests-way-rejuvenate-immune-system-1217"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; MIT neuroscientist Feng Zhang. "We're engineering the body to mimic thymic factor secretion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the T cell production boost generated through the liver was temporary. This reduces the risk of overstimulating the immune system, which can lead to inflammation and the body &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/nightmares-may-have-an-eerie-link-to-autoimmune-disease"&gt;attacking itself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results are promising, but this needs to be demonstrated to be a viable approach in humans as well as in mice. The researchers plan to expand their study in the future by looking at other types of animals, signal proteins, and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/surprising-immune-cell-discovery-wins-2025-nobel-prize-heres-the-science"&gt;immune cells&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been previous attempts to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/imr.12418"&gt;rejuvenate T cell production&lt;/a&gt;, including putting immune system boosters directly into the bloodstream, often with side effects and risks. These early results suggest this liver-based approach could offer a safe and effective alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we can restore something essential like the immune system, hopefully we can help people stay free of disease for a longer span of their life," &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/new-study-suggests-way-rejuvenate-immune-system-1217"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; Zhang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-025-09873-4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Trump assiduously courted R.F.K. Jr.’s support throughout the campaign, so why wouldn’t he put an anti-vaccine crank in charge of American public health? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But nothing in life is as inevitable as all that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Slow Boring</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 11:03:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMib0FVX3lxTE5qazhPckxScnhqbU9PeG51VFBQM2E5bE41UWdSemhxeE42R2VCU01uZGFYN2pHY1hNYzlGZUVWUURHTV9uX0hKT3dVdTJERmplOTV5VkpTSzd6UUE2UG5lNml0Z3ZUN3cwUHNxZFJMYw</guid></item><item><title>如果Ozempic不能彻底解决所有问题，该怎么办？ -论点|耶路撒冷德姆萨斯</title><link>https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/what-if-ozempic-doesnt-fix-literally</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div dir="auto" class="body markup"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Worst Take of the Week is a new occasional column where the author will rant about something we found stupid, annoying, bad, and/or irritating. While the title of this column was necessary for palindromic reasons, I cannot promise that entries will come out weekly or that each piece will literally be the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;worst&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt; take that week; this column would be boring and repetitive if each week I explained why genocide is bad in response to Twitter user @Nazi1488LoveHitler&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some arguments are bad because the author has made an empirical error.

I’ve never asked myself “Does chemotherapy make cancer patients happy?” or “Does insulin make diabetics happy?” or “Do malaria medications make &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/790174/estimated-share-of-total-malaria-cases-by-country/?srsltid=AfmBOoqiO8ha-ghDm5z7pzW1pgJ7vqquo9HTqM0dd2HDISOv8i4xaYna" rel&gt;Nigerians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; happy?” because the purpose of these medical advancements is to either save people’s lives or make them healthier.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it possible that some cancer or malaria survivors go on to be unhappy? I’m sure that some do, but it would never occur to me to evaluate the effectiveness of chemotherapy on this question. The purpose of chemotherapy is to cure cancer, not to give your life meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/what-if-ozempic-doesnt-fix-literally?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/what-if-ozempic-doesnt-fix-literally?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It’s worth spending some time talking about how bad obesity is.

Importantly, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9205425/" rel&gt;some of those COVID deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/risk-factors/obesity.html" rel&gt;some of those cancer deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; would likely not have happened if not for obesity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I presume that Brooks would never write a column arguing that cancer patients forgo chemotherapy and instead hustle their way to beating the disease through eating better and exercising more. Of course, this would be impossible, but the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt; same can be said for obesity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Yes, in theory, most every person should be able to lose weight through exercise and diet, but there are a good many theories that don’t pan out in real life. And there are few things more well-validated in the nutritional sciences than the finding that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://hartfordhospital.org/about-hh/news-center/news-detail?articleId=65632" rel&gt;most diets fail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Probably the most widely cited research on the fact that diets usually fail is the boringly but appropriately named “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29156185/" rel&gt;Maintenance of Lost Weight and Long-Term Management of Obesity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While dropping some weight, including pretty substantial weight loss, is certainly possible through a variety of diets, within five years, more than 80% of lost weight will be regained. The entire article went into the physiological and environmental reasons behind this problem, and it’s pretty accessible to nonresearchers, so if you’re interested (and I hope you are, Arthur) you can go read it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One study that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523295362" rel&gt;looked into the roughly 20% of overweight people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; who are successful at losing and keeping at least 10% of their initial body weight found that it requires an extraordinarily high level of willpower. These people are exercising roughly an hour a day and maintaining a low-calorie, low-fat diet with a high degree of vigilance in monitoring their body weight.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;But the facts are incontestable: For &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;whatever&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; reason, the vast majority of people who are desperately trying to lose weight, who are steeped in a society that reminds them constantly of the physical, social, and emotional harms of remaining overweight, are unable to do so. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These facts should make one curious. They should make one interested in new and exciting solutions to this seemingly intractable problem that increasingly afflicts people the world over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many people prefer confirmation bias to curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given these sad facts and the reality of rising obesity rates, GLP-1 drugs are a modern marvel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;They help people lose weight, yes, but studies have found that this weight loss is &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36216945/" rel&gt;sustained&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; with continued treatment. While semaglutide (Ozempic) averages about 15% of mean weight loss, tirzepatide (Zepbound) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35658024/" rel&gt;averages about 20%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and Eli Lilly’s newest drug may even help obese individuals &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/lillys-next-gen-drug-tops-zepbound-weight-loss-late-stage-osteoarthritis-trial-2025-12-11/" rel&gt;lose almost &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/lillys-next-gen-drug-tops-zepbound-weight-loss-late-stage-osteoarthritis-trial-2025-12-11/" rel&gt;30%&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/lillys-next-gen-drug-tops-zepbound-weight-loss-late-stage-osteoarthritis-trial-2025-12-11/" rel&gt; of their starting weight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Not only do these drugs help people lose and keep off weight, they reduce the rate of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37952131/" rel&gt;strokes and stroke-related deaths&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, they slow the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38785209/" rel&gt;progression of chronic kidney disease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, they cut the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39555826/" rel&gt;incidence of heart attacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and it’s possible they may even help reduce &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2831975" rel&gt;dementia risk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2829811" rel&gt;addiction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brooks’ main point is that GLP-1 drugs offer you “weight loss &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; struggle” and that “satisfaction is the joy you get from an accomplishment &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;after struggle.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;He went on to point out that while there’s nothing wrong with taking Ozempic “this is hardly evidence to yourself that you are a person of character and strength.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think many of my previous arguments apply here, but in addition, I think Brooks carries a fatal misunderstanding of how GLP-1 drugs actually work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ozempic and Mounjaro are not magic drugs that make excess weight vanish. Users &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2836527" rel&gt;still need to follow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a diet and exercise plan to achieve their goals.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;These drugs work to “&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://hsph.harvard.edu/news/diet-exercise-still-important-when-taking-weight-loss-medication/" rel&gt;reduce food cravings, increase fullness, slow digestion, and help with blood glucose control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;.” But as basically any modern human in a developed nation understands, it &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5735853/" rel&gt;is possible to eat a lot of food even if you are full&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; and have no cravings. And nothing can make you lace up your running shoes or hit the gym; these are still choices individuals have to make. GLP-1 agonists just lower that bar from “nearly impossible” to “possible with reasonable effort.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When normally dieting, people lose weight but then get &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;hungrier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which is a part of why it’s so hard to maintain that consistency. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5108589/" rel&gt;One study found&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; that “weight loss leads to a proportional increase in appetite resulting in eating above baseline by ~100kcal/day per kg of lost weight – an amount more than 3-fold larger than the corresponding energy expenditure adaptations.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;On Dr. Ashwin Sharma’s great newsletter, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.glp1digest.com/p/glp-1s-are-quietly-killing-your-cravings" rel&gt;GLP-1 Digest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Sharma pointed readers to a “groundbreaking randomized controlled trial” that included scans of “people’s brains in real-time as they looked at images of high-calorie, high sugar foods (think pizza, cakes, burgers etc) while taking tirzepatide, liraglutide, or a placebo.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So yes, current GLP-1 agonists are not magic pills. But, honestly, I’m fine biting the bullet: it would be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; if they were. Even if a single pill could cure you of obesity or heroin addiction or cancer or smoking, unlike Brooks I am not worried about robbing you of whatever satisfaction you might get from the hard slog of quitting unaided.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes things aren’t complicated: good things are good and bad things are bad&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-attrs='{"url":"https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/what-if-ozempic-doesnt-fix-literally?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share","text":"Share","action":null,"class":null}' data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton" class="button-wrapper"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/what-if-ozempic-doesnt-fix-literally?utm_source=substack&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_content=share&amp;amp;action=share" rel class="button primary"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Share&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While I think the question is orthogonal to the main point of GLP-1s, Brooks did highlight a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-75965-2" rel&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; showing that GLP-1 use is associated with increases in reported depression, anxiety, and suicidal behaviors. These are scary findings with reasonably sized effect sizes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After citing this research, Brooks concluded that the “jury’s still out” on whether GLP-1s will raise users’ well-being. But the juries are very much not out. Two of them have come back. And the verdict? Total exoneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In fact, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-requests-removal-suicidal-behavior-and-ideation-warning-glucagon-peptide-1-receptor-agonist-glp" rel&gt;days before&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; Brooks published his column highlighting this study, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration published its findings showing that after “comprehensive FDA review” there was “no increased risk” of suicidal ideation or behavior and requesting that the warning label should be removed from these products.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This review went over observational studies, case reports, and clinical trial data, as well as a comprehensive meta-analysis that included 107,910 patients and a retrospective cohort study that included 2.2 million users, neither of which found an increased risk of suicidal ideation or behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Perhaps Brooks could be forgiven for missing this update, but in &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/meeting-highlights-pharmacovigilance-risk-assessment-committee-prac-8-11-april-2024" rel&gt;April of 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, the European Medicines Agency — a decentralized EU agency responsible for “scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of medicines” — concluded that the existing evidence did not support a causal association between GLP-1s and “suicidal and self-injurious thoughts and actions.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is not even mentioning a May 2025 systematic review and meta-analysis that found GLP-1s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/2833558" rel&gt;were not associated with increased risk of psychiatric adverse events&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;. There are other papers, but instead of grappling with this research, Brooks poked fun at some rodent studies, quipping that it seems hard to “tell when a rat is feeling depressed.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brooks’ problem is that he seems to think humans lack opportunities to exert willpower and discipline. Yes, overcoming adversity is important to living a good life, but we live in a fallen world, and there will always be adversity — we don’t need to manufacture it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;How do I know this? Because the majority of Americans are &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; obese and still have to face the normal human problems of working a job, finding a partner, making and keeping friends, and getting triggered by widely read and badly reasoned articles.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A perennial problem for take-slingers, of which I am one, is that most of the important questions are boring. For instance, does B6 compounded tirzepatide perform better than Zepbound? Can newer GLP-1 agonists prevent the loss of muscle mass? Or should the government cover Ozempic-for-all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could list 5000 questions I have for researchers about the science of obesity, and at no point would I alight on: Should we worry that the miracle wonder drug eliminating the leading cause of preventable deaths works too well?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed" class="digestPostEmbed-flwiST"&gt;&lt;div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-flexDirection-column pc-reset"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/the-toxic-modernity-narrative" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;h2 class="pencraft pc-reset color-pub-primary-text-NyXPlw line-height-36-XIK16z font-display-nhmvtD size-30-tZAWf_ weight-bold-DmI9lw reset-IxiVJZ"&gt;The toxic modernity narrative&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-flexDirection-row pc-mobile-flexDirection-column pc-gap-16 pc-paddingTop-16 pc-reset"&gt;&lt;div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-flexDirection-column pc-reset flex-grow-rzmknG"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-QiPycG"&gt;On Tuesday, The Guardian published the best news I’ve heard all year: The microplastics panic was based on dubious science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component-name="DigestPostEmbed" class="digestPostEmbed-flwiST"&gt;&lt;div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-flexDirection-column pc-reset"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/most-americans-support-some-vaccines" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;h2 class="pencraft pc-reset color-pub-primary-text-NyXPlw line-height-36-XIK16z font-display-nhmvtD size-30-tZAWf_ weight-bold-DmI9lw reset-IxiVJZ"&gt;Most Americans support some vaccines.

			&lt;p&gt;High blood sugar spikes after meals could be a contributing factor &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/just-one-gene-may-be-responsible-for-over-90-of-alzheimers-cases"&gt;to Alzheimer's risk&lt;/a&gt;, according to a new study that gives us more insight into the relationship between  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/diabetes" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73018" data-postid="189166" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;diabetes&lt;/a&gt;, insulin resistance, and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous studies &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/jdi.12087"&gt;have found&lt;/a&gt; that diabetes and dementia can be connected in some cases. But whether one is causing the other, and what biological mechanisms are involved, remain areas that scientists are still investigating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, researchers from the UK ran an analysis of a large genetic dataset covering 357,883 individuals, finding that people with a relatively higher level of blood sugar (glucose) in the two hours after eating were also 69 percent more likely to develop &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimer-s-disease"&gt;Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/garlic-could-be-a-secret-weapon-to-keep-down-your-glucose-and-cholesterol"&gt;Garlic Could Be a Secret Weapon to Keep Down Your Glucose And Cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This finding could help shape future prevention strategies, highlighting the importance of managing blood sugar not just overall, but specifically after meals," &lt;a href="https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2026/01/14/blood-sugar-spikes-linked-to-higher-risk-of-alzheimers-disease/amp/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; epidemiologist Andrew Mason, from the University of Liverpool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used a technique called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_randomization"&gt;Mendelian Randomization&lt;/a&gt; (MR) to analyze the data. Instead of actually taking measurements of post-meal blood sugar, they looked for people with genes known to be associated with sugar spikes after eating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_189169" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-189169" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/AlzheimersGraph.jpg" alt="Alzheimer's risk graph" class="wp-image-189169 size-full" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/AlzheimersGraph.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/AlzheimersGraph-600x248.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-189169" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The data showed a significantly increased risk of  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="189166" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; connected to 2-hour post-load glucose (2hPG). (Mason et al., &lt;em&gt;Diabetes Obes. Metab.&lt;/em&gt;, 2025)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this looks at the genetics that each person is born with, it takes out the influence of environmental factors and &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/theres-one-critical-thing-you-can-do-to-cut-your-risk-of-dementia"&gt;other health conditions&lt;/a&gt;, allowing cause-and-effect to be determined more confidently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there was a strong connection between post-meal blood sugar spikes and Alzheimer's, no link was found for standard glucose or insulin levels, or insulin resistance, for either Alzheimer's or dementia overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, brain scans carried out on a subset of the participants showed no relationship between glucose or insulin traits and changes in brain or &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/brains-memory-center-never-stops-making-neurons-study-confirms"&gt;hippocampus size&lt;/a&gt;, or more white matter damage – the implication being that something more subtle is happening to connect sugar spikes with Alzheimer's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Previous observational and MR studies &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-0905"&gt;have suggested&lt;/a&gt; that 2-hour post-load glucose is a glycaemic trait that strongly predicts poorer cardiovascular outcomes," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/dom.70353"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the researchers in their published paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our findings suggest that the genetic predisposition for this marker of postprandial glucose is also associated with an increased risk for Alzheimer's disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's still not clear why a post-meal burst in sugar raises the risk of dementia, but we know that the brain &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2337/db20-0895"&gt;relies on glucose&lt;/a&gt;, just like the rest of the body. It's possible that some kind of inflammation or stress is being caused in brain cells after meals, and further down the line, targeting it could lead to dementia treatments or prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/castingcall?utm_source=SA_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=article&amp;amp;utm_campaign=casting_call"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg" alt="Audition now for ScienceAlert's Casting Call" class="alignnone wp-image-189354 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-1200x509.jpg 1200w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2026/01/Mid-Article-Promos-Casting-Call-1.jpg 1266w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there's a notable caveat to the research: the team was unable to replicate the findings in an older genetic dataset of 111,326 people – perhaps because of differences in how the participants were selected, the researchers suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original UK Biobank dataset used tends to skew towards healthier participants and individuals of a higher socioeconomic status, and exclusively draws on people of White British ancestry, so more work is required to test this idea in more diverse groups of people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We first need to replicate these results in other populations and ancestries to confirm the link and better understand the underlying biology," &lt;a href="https://news.liverpool.ac.uk/2026/01/14/blood-sugar-spikes-linked-to-higher-risk-of-alzheimers-disease/amp/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; genetic epidemiologist Vicky Garfield, from the University of Liverpool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If validated, the study could pave the way for new approaches to reduce dementia risk in people with diabetes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/dom.70353"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

African health leaders said it was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/15/hepatitis-b-vaccines-study-africa-cancel" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;cancelled&lt;/a&gt;. At the heart of the controversy is the west African nation of Guinea-Bissau – one of the poorest countries in the world and the proposed site of a hotly debated US-funded study on vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The study on hepatitis B vaccination, to be led by Danish researchers, became a flashpoint after major changes to the US vaccination schedule and prompted questions about how research is conducted ethically in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="sign-in-gate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;On Thursday, Quinhin Nantote, a military doctor and the recently appointed minister of health in &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/guinea-bissau" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Guinea-Bissau&lt;/a&gt;, confirmed to journalists that the trial has been “cancelled or suspended” because the science was not well-reviewed. Guinea-Bissau experienced a coup in November, and top leaders were recently replaced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;A team of research experts at the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, at Nantote’s request, will travel to Guinea-Bissau to help officials review the study. Officials from Denmark and the US have also been invited to review the trial, Jean Kaseya, director-general of the Africa CDC, said at the press meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The decision to halt the trial is not for international organizations or foreign countries to determine, Kaseya said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s the sovereignty of the country,” he said. “I don’t know what will be this decision, but I will support the decision that the minister will make.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Officials with the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have called into question the credibility of the Africa CDC, after officials with the organization &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/15/hepatitis-b-vaccines-study-africa-cancel" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; the study was cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“To be clear, the trial will proceed as planned,” Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, said in a statement on Wednesday. He said the Africa CDC was waging “a public-relations campaign aimed to shape public perception rather than engaging with the scientific facts”. When asked by the Guardian, he offered no proof of either claim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;An HHS official also called the Africa CDC “a powerless, fake organization attempting to manufacture credibility by repeating its claims publicly”, adding that the organization was “not a reliable source”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Kaseya said he had spoken to senior HHS officials, who were unaware of the statement, and he pointed to the Africa CDC’s key role in responding to outbreaks with global implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“It’s very important to fund research that Africans actually want,” said Abdulhammad Babatunde, a medical doctor and global health researcher in Nigeria. “Africans want to solve Africa’s problems, not satisfy the curiosity of the funders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The researchers would have given hepatitis B vaccines to 7,000 infants at birth and withheld the vaccines for another 7,000 infants until six weeks of age in order to study the overall health effects of giving the vaccines alongside other shots. Nearly one in five adults and about 11% of young children in Guinea-Bissau have hepatitis B – putting them at high risk of severe illness and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“This is not acceptable,” said Babatunde of the study’s design. “To prevent things like the Tuskegee study and others, the control group has to get the standard of care, and the intervention group should get [potentially] better care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The World Health Organization &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-b" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; giving the hepatitis B vaccine to all newborns within 24 hours of birth. Infants in Guinea-Bissau currently receive the shot at six weeks of age, but the doses will roll out to all newborns in 2028 in order to close gaps in care standards. “The current reason why the vaccine is not achieving coverage in Guinea-Bissau is because there’s no funding, and the funding should try to promote the vaccine, not use children as lab rats,” Babatunde said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;Officials in an imbalanced power structure may be intimidated, he said. “It might be a very tough call for the officials in Guinea-Bissau, depending on what they stand to lose if they restrict the study. At this moment, it’s [time] for other African member states to come support Guinea-Bissau, to maintain their sovereignty and protect the children of Guinea-Bissau.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;When deciding whether a revised version of the study will move forward, “the most important voice” is that of Guinea-Bissau’s ministry of health, which is responsible for protecting the health of all Bissau-Guineans, said Gavin Yamey, professor of global health at the Duke Global &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/health" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="auto-linked-tag"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt; Institute. “So hearing from ministry officials today is hugely important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The confusion in Guinea-Bissau comes back to how the trial was given the green light, said Nantote, who spoke in Portuguese through a translator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;An early version of the study was approved by Guinea-Bissau’s six-person ethics committee, Comité Nacional de Ética em Pesquisa em Saúde (CNEPS), on 5 November, &lt;a href="https://www.bandim.org/protocol-for-the-trial-the-broader-health-effects-of-hepatitis-b-vaccination-at-birth-an-investigator-initiated-randomized-controlled-trial-in-guinea-bissau/" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the Danish researchers. The researchers have since made updates that have not been approved by the committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Guinea-Bissau ethics committee, CNEPS, initially approved the study, according to an individual who identified himself to the Guardian as the interim director of CNEPS. The study did not mention that infants would go unvaccinated, he said – but the ethical concern is that the vaccine would be withheld from some newborns at birth, when it is most needed. No further changes have been made to the design of the trial because it was “suspended” by the country’s ministry of health, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;“We think that they did not meet and they did not address this issue adequately,” Nantote said of the ethics committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The Danish researchers did not appear to seek approval from ethics boards in Denmark or the US, though the Helsinki declaration requires approval from research ethics committees in both the sponsoring and host countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-130mj7b"&gt;The HHS did not respond to the Guardian’s questions on ethical concerns and its characterization of the Africa CDC. The researchers did not respond to inquiries about the trial’s cancellation or questions about their research.

                &lt;p&gt;After 10 years of jogging, I officially ran out of steam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As much fun as I had finishing my &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/i-ran-my-first-marathon-advice-mistakes-2024-11" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;first marathon&lt;/a&gt; in 2024, the training burned me out. In the months that followed, I had no desire to hit the track near my home, let alone sign up for another race. Plus, my go-to running buddies and I all moved, making running a more solitary and, frankly, boring activity. While I could join a new local run club, I resisted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, in the second half of 2025, I put the brakes on my decade-long running routine. Instead of running 3 to 4 miles almost every day (and taking only two workout classes a week), I started a new schedule. I alternated taking &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/powerlifting-doctor-shares-exercises-build-muscle-longevity-2025-12" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;strength-training classes&lt;/a&gt; with strictly walking days. That way, I go to a hard workout class about 3 to 4 times a week (still trying to fit in short walks when I can), and stroll for longer stretches the rest of the time, at least 3 miles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swapping running with walking gave me pause at first. On one hand, I knew plenty of people who were more physically fit than me and avoided running at all costs. At the same time, I was a runner for so long, and I worried about gaining weight or becoming more sedentary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, I ended up &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-i-lost-fat-changed-body-composition-in-1-year-2026-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;burning fat&lt;/a&gt; more effectively than when I was running, losing about 5 pounds in about a 6-month timeframe. But the best part was mental: I felt calmer and less spread-thin, enough to actually enjoy exercising again.&lt;/p&gt;
              
            
              
            &lt;h2 id="58a71b57-76c3-4562-be3b-2b311d62c18c" data-toc-id="58a71b57-76c3-4562-be3b-2b311d62c18c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I end up moving more — and burning more fat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
              &lt;figure class="figure image-figure-image   " data-type="img" data-e2e-name="image-figure-image" data-media-container="image" itemscope="" itemtype="https://schema.org/ImageObject"&gt;

                      I nearly doubled my average daily step count by the end of the year.

                    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Because I was so sick of running, I wasn't moving as fast as I used to, and I couldn't motivate myself to go any quicker. As a result, running three miles didn't burn as many calories for me anymore, because my body had gotten used to that pace and plateaued. To see results, I would need to increase my speed, distance, or incline — the last things I was interested in doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/reference/popular-calorie-burning-cardio-exercises" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;walking burns fewer calories&lt;/a&gt; than running, I knew I had to dedicate more time to walking to get the same results. Now, I aim for about an hour of walking a day, double the time I spent running.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, it's been a lot easier to keep up with. I don't need to change into workout gear or try to squeeze in a treadmill session (that includes shower time) on my 1-hour lunch break. I just get up and go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I live in one of the &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/best-cities-in-us-for-walking-from-frequent-traveler-2025-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;most walkable US cities&lt;/a&gt;, I don't have to plan it out that much, either. I can just get off at an earlier subway stop to walk more, or step outside when my schedule frees up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also been simpler to keep up with this routine when I'm on vacation. Instead of aspiring to run (and always deciding I'd rather sleep in), I commit to a daily walk or hike. That much, I can always do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="6ba1a2b6-278e-4bbb-95f3-e37e50ffe35e" data-toc-id="6ba1a2b6-278e-4bbb-95f3-e37e50ffe35e"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I get more out of my hard workout days&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Keeping a steady schedule of alternating workout and walk days means I feel more rested when I take my classes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if I find time to walk before class, I don't feel as depleted as I would after a 3-mile jog. I find myself lifting heavier and having more energy to really push myself — which is the only way to &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-build-muscle-fast-bodybuilder-scientist-tips-2025-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;build muscle&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, I learned from wearing a heart rate monitor that I personally burn about the same number of calories in a weight training session as I do on a 3-mile jog (with the added benefit of gaining strength).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I do run, I opt for shorter and much faster sprints. Most of the workout classes I take have a cardio component, where the goal is power. I aim to reach a zone 4 &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vo2-max-test-running-cardio-zones-burn-fat-build-muscle-2025-9" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;heart rate zone&lt;/a&gt; on the treadmill, going at a more challenging pace. I'll run anywhere from 2 to 4 minutes faster per mile — all of which is easier and more fun for me to work on when I'm not running &lt;em&gt;all the time&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="da60d8a3-da1b-4d66-807d-46d8e9dbe661" data-toc-id="da60d8a3-da1b-4d66-807d-46d8e9dbe661"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better results, minus the stress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

                      Walking helped me slow down and relax more.

                  &lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;/figure&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;My mindset around running left me feeling frazzled and resentful. It seemed like all I did was work out, but I wasn't seeing results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forcing myself to scale back and walk didn't just &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/optimize-workout-personal-trainer-red-green-flags-2025-4" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;improve my gym performance&lt;/a&gt; or help me reach my weight loss goals faster. It also calmed me down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started going on morning coffee walks with my husband, or taking laps near the office to decompress from a long day of curving my back like a cooked shrimp over my laptop. My other habits, like snacking less or &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/i-cut-drinking-alcohol-one-and-non-rule-mocktails-2026-1" data-track-click='{"element_name":"body_link","event":"tout_click","index":"bi_value_unassigned","product_field":"bi_value_unassigned"}' rel=""&gt;cutting back on alcohol&lt;/a&gt;, also became less of a sacrifice. If I wasn't constantly stressing myself out to run in 20-degree weather, I didn't need a little treat to make up for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm glad the opposite of my fears came true: By changing up my long-held routine, I'm getting fitter. I just needed to take some baby steps first.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Indian authorities are rushing to contain a Nipah virus outbreak
after five cases were reported and nearly 100 people quarantined in
the eastern state of West Bengal, &lt;strong&gt;Azernews&lt;/strong&gt; reports
via The Independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those infected are two nurses, a doctor, and a healthcare
worker, raising concerns over hospital-based transmission. Health
officials said some patients remain in critical condition, while
others are showing signs of recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nipah virus is classified by the World Health Organization
as a priority pathogen due to its high epidemic potential and
fatality rate. At present, there is no approved vaccine or specific
antiviral treatment for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early symptoms typically include high fever, headache, muscle
pain, vomiting, and general weakness. In more severe cases, the
infection can lead to acute encephalitis, respiratory failure, and
coma. Survivors of severe illness may face long-term neurological
complications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities have stepped up surveillance, contact tracing, and
isolation protocols as efforts continue to prevent further spread
of the virus in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new confirmed cases included a doctor, a nurse, and a health
staff member, news wire agency Press Trust of India reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 100 people have been asked to quarantine in their homes
after the first case came to light on Monday, the government
officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with the latest infections have been admitted to the
infectious diseases hospital in eastern Kolkata’s Beleghata, while
the earlier ones are still admitted in the Intensive Care Unit at a
private hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

that babies receive a vitamin K shot at birth to protect them from severe bleeding in early life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;These recommendations have significantly reduced vitamin K deficiency bleeding. Without this injection at birth, babies are over 80 times more likely to develop severe bleeding, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vitamin-k-deficiency/faq/index.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;However, in recent years, health care professionals say more parents are refusing vitamin K shots for their newborns. Additionally, a study published earlier this month found that the proportion of newborns who did not receive a vitamin K shot has nearly doubled in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Doctors told ABC News this trend is very concerning and warned that foregoing this shot at birth puts babies at higher risk for life-threatening bleeding early in life that can have debilitating or deadly consequences.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;What is vitamin K, and why do babies need it at birth? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Vitamin K is necessary to help the body form clots appropriately, but babies are born with very small amounts of this vitamin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This puts them at increased risk of a condition called vitamin K deficiency bleeding, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vitamin-k-deficiency/fact-sheet/index.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;To prevent this bleeding, a vitamin K injection has been recommended for newborns in the U.S. since the early 1960s. It's given as a single, intramuscular shot soon after birth.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Vitamin K is a critical factor for clotting the blood, so the best way that we can prevent bleeding in newborn babies is to give them a shot of vitamin K," Dr. Kristan Scott, a neonatologist at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told ABC News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Since this injection became standard of care, doctors say it is now very rare for babies to experience vitamin K deficiency bleeding in the U.S., but they worry more babies will suffer from bleeding complications as more parents refuse the shot.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"It was a really successful public health intervention that decreased the likelihood infants were going to have bleeds, whether that be spontaneous in their head or abdomen or following a procedure like a circumcision," Dr. Katharine Clouser, a pediatric hospital medicine provider at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, told ABC News. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Clouser explained that in addition to babies having low levels of vitamin K at birth, they don't get enough from breast milk or formula, making this early injection important for bleeding prevention as early as possible.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;That protection extends until babies have introduced enough solids in their diet that contain higher levels of vitamin K, which is usually around 6 months old, Clouser said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;Why are fewer newborns receiving vitamin K? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Doctors told ABC News that, in recent years, more parents have been refusing or questioning the necessity of a vitamin K injection at birth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Clouser said that within her group at the hospital, along with discussions among groups across the country, "many people are anecdotally seeing that we're having more discussions about families who are refusing." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;She continued, "Many pediatricians, and even those who are practicing general pediatrics outside in an office, they're often counseling these families before the baby is born, meeting them before they're born and having a lot of these discussions, which we were not needing to have prior to the last couple of years." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Some of the refusals have been fueled by misinformation, such as fears the preservative in the shot could harm

vaccine.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Vitamin K is not a vaccine, it's a supplement," Scott said. "Vitamin K is just a vitamin K supplement and is safe for babies." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;A recent study, published in the medical journal &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2842444?guestAccessKey=94d98e67-297d-479f-a0ad-9b3daee96709&amp;amp;utm_source=for_the_media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=120825" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;JAMA&lt;/a&gt;, for which Scott was a lead researcher, found an ongoing drop in newborns receiving the protective shot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Scott and other researchers analyzed more than 5 million health records from 2017 to 2024. They found that in 2024, 5.2% of newborns did not receive a vitamin K injection at birth compared to about 3% in 2017.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;This equates to nearly 190,000 babies who did not receive a vitamin K shot in 2024, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr038.pdf" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;based on population estimates.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"[This] might sound like a small increase, but it's a really significant increase in the number of families who are refusing the injectable vitamin K," Clouser, who was not involved in the study, said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Scott said many medical colleagues have shared anecdotes that they are seeing more babies with vitamin K deficiency bleeding as more parents refuse this shot.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"What's concerning is that that number could potentially continue to increase, and then we are going to have a larger number of babies that, unfortunately, are at risk of vitamin K deficiency bleeding," Scott said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Numerous studies that have been done over decades have ruled out harms such as a link between the vitamin K shot and childhood cancer, the &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vitamin-k-deficiency/faq/index.html" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;CDC says&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Doctors recommend that parents talk to a trusted health care provider or pediatrician before making a decision to refuse vitamin K, to better understand the benefits of the shot and the risks of refusing it.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Clouser said giving a vitamin K injection at birth is a very common practice around the globe.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"We have a ton of safety data over years and years and years of these formulations, and in fact, we give a smaller dose than we used to, knowing that we have found a really effective dose." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;&lt;strong class="vtkaO "&gt;What are the risks of not receiving vitamin K at birth? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Bleeding can happen anywhere in the body without adequate vitamin K, but one of the most feared complications is bleeding that occurs in or surrounding the brain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Any brain bleed can be life-threatening and, if it's not life-threatening, it can potentially lead to permanent disability for the rest of that baby's life," Dr. Leah Croll, assistant professor of neurology at SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, told ABC News.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Croll explained that babies are at increased risk for brain bleeding because the blood vessels in and surrounding the brain grow rapidly early in life.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Those growing arteries and veins can be more likely to break and bleed, and that can cause very devastating consequences that can be potentially permanent," she said. "I'm very, very concerned to learn that parents are potentially electing to opt out of vitamin K administration at birth." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Croll went on, "The idea that this decision could have these consequences, that the baby is then left to deal with for the rest of their life, is really almost hard to wrap your mind around." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Scott said excessive bleeding from the umbilical cord or after any procedure, such as a circumcision, is also a common complication of vitamin K deficiency bleeding. One &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1477513124006752" target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; found that vitamin K injection after birth reduced the risk of severe bleeding by sixfold after circumcision.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Meanwhile, doctors say the risks of the vitamin K injection itself are rare and minimal. The risk of complications from not receiving a vitamin K shot at birth far outweighs the risks of the injection itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"There is a risk of a local redness or irritation from an injection because it is an injection, but beyond that, there are really minimal harms to giving vitamin K," Scott said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;An oral formulation of vitamin K exists, but it is riskier to use in place of the intramuscular injection, doctors say. Instead of a single shot, oral vitamin K would have to be given in multiple doses for weeks early in the baby's life to offer protection from bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Truthfully, we don't know how much of the oral vitamin K a baby would be absorbing. And so, to truly use evidence to prevent risk in vitamin K deficiency bleeding, we should be giving the intramuscular shot," Scott said.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Clouser said that doctors have evidence of what can happen when vitamin K stops being used. In the early 1980s, some hospitals in England stopped providing vitamin K as a routine recommendation due to an alleged association between the vitamin K shot and childhood cancer, and it was only recommended for children at high risk for bleeds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Following this move, cases of vitamin K deficiency bleeding increased among newborns in England, &lt;a class="zZygg UbGlr iFzkS qdXbA WCDhQ DbOXS tqUtK GpWVU iJYzE " data-testid="prism-linkbase" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1421901/#:~:text=Abstract,the%20respective%2095%25%20confidence%20intervals." target="_blank" dir="ltr"&gt;research found&lt;/a&gt;. The oral formulation of vitamin K was less effective, eventually leading to revised recommendations in favor of the shot, given universally for all babies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"Oftentimes, families are not receiving the whole story, right?" Clouser said. "They hear that England paused it for a while, but don't know what happened afterward. And so, I think that parents are really wanting to have more information and they don't know who they can trust." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;"I think that what we need to recognize is that a trusted pediatrician, your trusted [obstetrician] are all recommending this vitamin K injection," she said. "And so, we know it is safe. ... I think when you have a consensus like that from many different types of medical providers, whether it be nurses, midwives, physicians, OBGYNs, pediatricians, everyone is saying the same thing. I think it's definitely something that can be trusted." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC eTIW sUzSN "&gt;&lt;em class=" "&gt;Jade A.
