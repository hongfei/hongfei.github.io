The researchers say it suggests that women should not be prescribed HRT if they've been menopausal for over 10 years without treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Gillian Coughlan, a neurologist at Mass General Brigham Hospital in Boston and first author of the study, said: ‘Our data indicate that HT may influence tau accumulation as a function of age, with implications for cognitive decline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We hope that our study will help to inform AD risk discussions relating to women’s reproductive health and treatment.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The women who took HRT later had higher levels of a protein called tau in certain brain regions responsible for memory and cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Women over 70 years old who had used hormone therapy for menopause showed faster buildup of tau, a key protein involved in Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tau is a key factor in the genesis of Alzheimer’s disease, which affects nearly seven million Americans annually, around two-thirds of whom are women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Tau proteins help maintain the structure and function of brain cell networks, enabling communication between cells. When this wiring is damaged, tau proteins become loose and break away, leading to communication breakdowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The damaged tau proteins clump together, forming toxic tangles in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Over time, these tangles kill brain cells, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14190691/dementia-doctor-warns-early-alzheimers-disease-signs.html"&gt;contributing to the cognitive decline&lt;/a&gt; seen in Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was published in the journal Science Advances.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers from Mass General Brigham, an integrated health care system that includes Harvard Medical School-affiliated hospitals and other health care facilities, recruited 146 women, with an average age ranging from 51 to 89, at the beginning of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Half had used HT an average of 14 years prior and the other half never used it at all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They had PET scans checking for amyloid beta, another protein believed to be responsible for the onset of Alzheimer's, over an average of four and a half years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The graph on the left shows that in older women, HT was associated with significantly faster tau accumulation in specific brain regions, including the entorhinal cortex responsible for memory. The graph on the right shows similar increases with age in the inferior temporal gyrus involved in visual processing such as such as faces and objects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The women also underwent PET scans to look for tau tangles over three and a half years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women over 70 who used hormone therapy showed faster tau buildup in brain areas linked to memory and recognition compared to non-users of the same age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The tau accumulation was linked to cognitive decline and was only seen in HT users, suggesting that tau buildup might contribute to their cognitive issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In women under 70, HT use appeared to protect against tau buildup in the area responsible for memory consolidation, with no significant cognitive decline in non-users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers are unsure if the faster tau buildup in older HT users is due to when they started therapy or if older individuals naturally show more tau buildup in PET scans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Women are more likely to have higher levels of tau buildup in brain cells over the course of their lives. This could be driven by an enzyme that lives on the X chromosome, of which women have two copies compared to one in men.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This means more of the enzyme enters women’s brains which inhibits the recycling of tau, leading to more build-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The decline in estrogen during menopause is believed to play a major role in the accumulation of tau in women’s brains, likely due to the hormone’s involvement in protecting the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Coughlan said: ‘Our findings add to the evidence that delaying initiation of HT, especially in older women, could lead to worse Alzheimer’s outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;‘We hope that our study will help to inform AD risk discussions relating to women’s reproductive health and treatment.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be time to find America’s next top bottle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microplastics are everywhere — in the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389424016327" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;beauty products&lt;/a&gt; we wear, the &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004896972304528X" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;cleaning supplies&lt;/a&gt; we use and even in the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/09/health/microplastics-found-in-nearly-90-of-meat-plant-based-proteins/"&gt;food we eat&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2024/12/429161/microplastics-air-may-be-leading-lung-and-colon-cancers"&gt;Research suggests&lt;/a&gt; that these particles, smaller than a grain of rice, can harm reproductive, digestive and respiratory health, potentially leading to &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10340669/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;colon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://enveurope.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s12302-022-00605-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;lung cancer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://genomicpress.kglmeridian.com/view/journals/brainmed/aop/article-10.61373-bm025c.0020/article-10.61373-bm025c.0020.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;In a new scientific paper&lt;/a&gt;, three physicians report that switching from &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/01/09/business/bottled-water-contains-more-plastic-particles-than-previously-thought-study/"&gt;bottled water&lt;/a&gt; to filtered tap water could cut your microplastic intake by about 90% — from 90,000 to 4,000 particles each year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;This diagram shows the chemical components of microplastics. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;In a new scientific paper, three physicians report that one switch could cut your microplastic intake by about 90% — from 90,000 to 4,000 particles each year. Colorful microplastics are shown here under a magnifying glass. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;iStockphoto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Given the widespread presence of microplastics in the environment, completely eliminating exposure is unrealistic. A more practical approach is to reduce the most significant sources of microplastic intake,” the researchers wrote this week in the Genomic Press.&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;This advice may be tough to swallow. Bottled water was America’s favorite packaged drink last year, &lt;a href="https://bottledwater.org/bottled-water-consumption-shift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;according to industry data&lt;/a&gt;, with 16.2 billion gallons consumed, a 2% increase from 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Bottled water was America’s favorite packaged drink last year, but it’s also a significant source of microplastics. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images/iStockphoto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t ready to ditch your plastic bottles or don’t have &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/01/15/health/drinking-water-of-97m-americans-contaminated-with-unregulated-chemicals-study/"&gt;a filter for your tap&lt;/a&gt;, there are other ways to reduce microplastic intake.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="p-5"&gt;“Beyond bottled water, significant dietary sources of microplastics are alcohol and seafood,” the researchers wrote. “Stopping the practice of heating food in plastic could be one of the most effective ways to reduce microplastic consumption.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microwaving food in plastic containers can release up to 4.22 million microplastic particles per square centimeter in just a few minutes. Opt for &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/12/26/shopping/mcirco-meal-prep-containers-deal-amazon/"&gt;glass or stainless steel containers&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other recommendations include not storing food in plastic and limiting consumption of canned and ultra-processed foods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Highly processed foods, like chicken nuggets, contained 30 times more microplastics per gram than chicken breasts, highlighting the impact of industrial processing, which often uses plastics at some point,” the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;“Stopping the practice of heating food in plastic could be one of the most effective ways to reduce microplastic consumption,” the researchers wrote. &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The world’s companies are believed to generate nearly 460 million metric tons of plastic annually — this figure is projected to increase to 1.1 billion metric tons by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Americans inhale and ingest an estimated &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.9b01517" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;39,000 to 52,000 microplastic particles&lt;/a&gt; a year, one study found.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11186737/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Microplastics have been detected&lt;/a&gt; in human &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/12/22/microplastics-found-in-placenta-are-creating-cyborg-baby/"&gt;placentas&lt;/a&gt;, kidneys, lungs, livers, testicles and blood, among other organs and tissues.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2025/02/04/health/spoonful-of-microplastics-found-in-peoples-brains-study/"&gt;Startling research&lt;/a&gt; published last month found that the human brain contains approximately a spoon’s worth of tiny shreds of plastic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These particles &lt;a href="https://magazine.hms.harvard.edu/articles/microplastics-everywhere" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;can damage intestinal cells&lt;/a&gt;, trigger inflammation and disturb the balance of bacteria in the gut.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the new paper, the researchers call for more studies on the long-term health effects of microplastics and “clear” limits on their exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But while “reducing intake is a logical approach,” the researchers wrote, “it remains unclear whether this translates into a measurable reduction in microplastic accumulation within human tissues.”&lt;/p&gt;

A &lt;a class="css-yywogo" href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt5619" title="" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; begins to shed some light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Researchers scanned the brains of dozens of women in the weeks before and after childbirth and found that two brain areas involved in the processing and control of emotions increased in size in women who developed symptoms of postpartum depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;The results, published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, constitute some of the first evidence that postpartum depression is associated with changes in the brain during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;Researchers found that women with symptoms of depression in the first month after giving birth also had increases in the volume of their amygdala, a brain area that plays a key role in emotional processing. Women who rated their childbirth experience as difficult or stressful — a perception that is often associated with postpartum depression — also showed increases in the volume of the hippocampus, a brain area that helps regulate emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="css-s99gbd StoryBodyCompanionColumn" data-testid="companionColumn-1"&gt;&lt;div class="css-53u6y8"&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“This is really the first step in trying to understand how does the brain change in people who have a normal course of pregnancy and then those who experience perinatal depression, and what can we do about it,” said Dr. Sheila Shanmugan, an assistant professor of psychiatry, obstetrics-gynecology and radiology at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-at9mc1 evys1bk0"&gt;“The big takeaways are about how there are these really profound brain changes during pregnancy and how now we’re seeing it in depression circuitry specifically,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-1336jj"&gt;&lt;div class="css-121kum4"&gt;&lt;p class="css-171quhb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="css-asuuk5"&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-7axq9l" data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript"&gt;&lt;svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" aria-hidden="true" class="css-1b5b8u1"&gt;&lt;path fill="currentColor" fill-rule="evenodd" d="M2.5 12a9.5 9.5 0 1 1 19 0 9.5 9.5 0 0 1-19 0Zm8.5 1.75v-7.5h2v7.5h-2Zm0 2v2h2v-2h-2Z" clip-rule="evenodd"&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;div data-testid="optimistic-truncator-noscript-message" class="css-6yo1no"&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;We are having trouble retrieving the article content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="css-3kpklk"&gt;Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;div class="css-1dv1kvn" id="optimistic-truncator-a11y" tabindex="-1"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="77" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7w5ydtj001f3b732nei3bqn@published"&gt;My wife and I are relative newcomers to anal play. We bought a butt plug to experiment. It’s a small bulb with a pretty flower flange at the end. Yesterday, after some digital penetration with lube, one finger first then a second, my wife inserted the plug and we started to have sex from behind. Everything was going great (like really great!) until I started to see the plug, flange and all, start to move inside her.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="102" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7w7cyc3004t3b73kk511fkm@published"&gt;I stopped immediately and was able to hook a finger behind the flange, but it was clearly past the external sphincter. It really hurt her when I tried to pull it back. So I just kept going on as she tried to slow her breathing and relax, both of us terrified we were seconds away from an emergency room visit we really did not want to make. Eventually, I was able to pull it back out with some discomfort. How do we make sure this never happens again, assuming we even try? Should we just use a plug with a bigger flange?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="109" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7w5ye1m001i3b73bsth4lfo@published"&gt;I don’t know why this is, but the beautiful little anal plugs—with pretty flowers, gems, and other adornments on the ends—hardly ever have a wide enough flange to be safe for use. If we lived in a different world, there might be scientific data regarding how wide a flange should be, or even detail about how wide a flange should be for what size of butthole, or—dreaming wildly here—FDA certification that confirms a flange is wide enough. But we live in this world, and so all I can say is go for a significantly larger flange-to-protrusion ratio than that of the toy which got sucked into your wife’s rectum.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="127" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7w5ye4b001j3b73pi1vue93@published"&gt;Dr. Evan Goldstein, a longtime friend of the column and anal surgeon, sells a couple of his own products along with some picks from other toy producers &lt;a href="https://shop.bespokesurgical.com/collections/dilators"&gt;on his website&lt;/a&gt;. I feel comfortable trusting the judgment of an anal surgeon with regard to whether a toy is likely to be safe for insertion. There are also some recommendations for plugs with flared handles at the &lt;a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sex/sex-toy-stuck-in-vagina-anus#tips-for-anal-toys"&gt;bottom of this article&lt;/a&gt;. That said, don’t put your full trust into any one product. It is best practice to monitor the anal plug during penetration. Your wife should be paying attention to what she feels, and you should be paying attention to what you see, so you can take any necessary action before the object is actually fully inside her rectum.&lt;/p&gt;

Go slow and use lube, of course, but the upside is that a penis—attached to the rest of a human—can’t get lost inside her intestines and require surgical removal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="94" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7w5yuzm001t3b73uqeoptam@published"&gt;I love my husband deeply and cherish our emotional connection, but sexually, I need something he struggles to give me. I crave dominance and rougher sex. My ex was dominant and in a consensual way, he would share me with two of his friends. Being with the three of them made for some of the most thrilling and deeply fulfilling years of my life. I felt desired in the most primal way, completely surrendered, utterly used, and yet worshiped at the same time. It was intoxicating. That was years ago before marriage and kids.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="114" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7w5yuzn001u3b73wwlhtn4k@published"&gt;I have come to realize that to be truly satisfied sexually, I need this feeling from my partner. My husband is very loving but too gentle. He’s tried, but the primal energy I need isn’t natural for him. We tried a male-female-male threesome but it just wasn’t the same. Since starting hormone replacement, these cravings have come back stronger than ever. I can’t suppress them, and I don’t want to stop the hormones. I’ve had thoughts about other men, but I would never cheat—I want this to be open, honest, and above board. How do I tell my husband that I need other lovers with more dominant energy while keeping our emotional connection intact?&lt;/p&gt;

No matter how carefully and kindly you phrase it, the core of what you want to express is that you crave something your husband has been unable to give you. That’s a hard thing to hear, no matter how confident and open a person is.&lt;/p&gt;

  


  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="37" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7w5yuzo001y3b73atx1wn4i@published"&gt;When you have to have difficult conversations, does your husband do better with ripping the band-aid off or with a slow process? Thinking back on previous successful conversations can help you tailor your approach on this subject.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="197" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm7w5yuzo001z3b73pb7ldtas@published"&gt;Your opening line in this letter does a great job of starting with what you value about your husband—what he means to you, what keeps you in the relationship—and then succinctly describing the issue with a bit of nuance. I’d start there, and stop there as well. Give him the chance to respond. Give him the autonomy to make suggestions of his own. He might be open to making another effort at giving you the kind of sex you crave. There are classes, books, and online workshops at his disposal. He might be able to hire a dominant as a coach to help him find what you need inside of himself. Or, he might suggest opening things up of his own accord. The point is, don’t take his power away by coming in with a firm decision about what needs to happen next. Furthermore, you had one (lackluster) MMF threesome—would you give up on heterosexuality after one instance of bad sex with a man? I’m guessing not. So keep that option open as well. Approach this difficulty as a team, and collaborate on ideas for how the two of you might move forward while meeting your desires.&lt;/p&gt;

You can think back on how you’ve successfully approached difficult issues in the past, and on specific approaches that have gone poorly, to get an idea of how to set yourself up for success, but you’re taking a risk. One of the real tests of a relationship is how you recover and repair from upset. So, while you’re thinking back on previous conversations, take a moment to note ways you’ve had success de-escalating situations that became emotionally heightened. Basically, these examples are all tools you have at your disposal—having them top of mind will hopefully remind you to use them as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

You don’t really give much information in your letter, so I don’t have an exact template for you. But leading with the love and regard you have for her, being as succinct as possible about the difficult part, and balancing directness with kindness will serve you well.&lt;/p&gt;

For instance, between 1998 and 2018, autism diagnoses jumped by 787 percent in the UK alone; &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/pill-kills-ticks-lyme-disease-babesiosis-anaplasmosis/"&gt;Lyme disease&lt;/a&gt; has an estimated 85 percent overdiagnosis rate, including in countries where it’s impossible to contract the disease; and there’s still little evidence that many &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/cancer/"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; screening programs actually reduce cancer-related death rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Ahead of her keynote speech at &lt;a href="https://health.wired.com/"&gt;WIRED Health&lt;/a&gt; later this month, O’Sullivan spoke to WIRED to talk about the boundaries between illness and health, the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/nocebo-effect"&gt;nocebo effect&lt;/a&gt;, and the dangers of early detection. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="Container-hnJNtl gxMaIG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WIRED: You’ve been a neurologist for nearly 35 years. When did you start seeing this new phenomenon of overdiagnosis?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suzanne O’Sullivan:&lt;/strong&gt; In the book I write about Darcy, a young lady who came to me with seizures. She’s only 24 and she had ten other diagnoses. I’m an epilepsy specialist, and that should mean that I’m only seeing people with epilepsy, but unfortunately seizures are a thing that happen very frequently for psychosomatic reasons. When I started, people came to me with seizures that had a psychological cause. That’s all they had.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="GenericCalloutWrapper-tojWn efJA-DB callout--has-top-border" data-testid="GenericCallout"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;But over the course of the last ten years, that particular group of patients started to gather a long list of diagnoses. What seems to be happening now is that if you go to different doctors with multiple symptoms, you will get a name for them all. These symptoms always existed, but the naming of them has been detrimental to patients. It’s caused them to pay a lot of attention to their bodies and that makes the symptoms worse. That’s the nocebo effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Every week now I see at least one Darcy, a 24-year old with different medical labels. Most of those labels have no treatment and aren’t making them better. That’s a very concerning trend for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are doctors over-labeling symptoms rather than trying to get to the root cause of the disease?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;We did have an underdiagnosis problem in the past, particularly with learning or behavioral problems such as &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/tag/autism/"&gt;autism&lt;/a&gt; and ADHD. We didn’t recognize people who needed help, so we’ve been trying to correct that. But we’ve overcorrected. We have been working on the assumption that the more we diagnose, the healthier you can make the population. That was probably true to a point, but the improvement isn’t sustained when you get into the milder end of any disease spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;Patients come to us wanting answers. People want to understand why they are the way they are. A satisfying consultation between a doctor and a patient is often one where the patient asks about a symptom and the doctor can explain what it is. I think it’s a little bit of a collusion between what patients want and how doctors can satisfy them with labels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The increase in the diagnosis rates for ADHD and autism, in particular, have exploded over the past decade. Is this the result of the shifting boundaries between what we now consider to be health and sickness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paywall"&gt;That’s my concern. Autism has risen from like one in 2,500 people to one in 36 children in the UK and one in 20 in Northern Ireland. That happened because people realized that there must be kids out there who’ve got milder forms of this, and if we help them, they’ll get better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>WIRED</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 17:04:02 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipwFBVV95cUxOY3JrV0VDZDhUWnRPUDgzc2ZLdzN5b2txTWdrdDlBaThFWHQ3amMtUGdlZ0ljZ2pvMHNwR21pSjZRLUlVTXdMdkdRdWh2UDBGNHFSMWxQVlA2UFd1cFhyamVOTnBycjBNanZkUTZKdjlJdTd1RkVPNnRBZkRqNFZjenRteG95bjJvVXFUSGdEUnJiUWRJOVdjUXNpaXh4cGxtbU5NQk10NA</guid></item><item><title>NIH-funded research team engineers new drug targeting pain sensation pathway - National Institutes of Health</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivwFBVV95cUxPVHp0ZVYtSG9lVkVKS2JIRnN4NTVtZzNyd0NfcnMtNV9ITVVmSk5zeFQ2Sjg1YWlKV29sUXJ2WEl6dGsxNzl1bE5xSGNUZWRoNTJIdko1ZUR6cXl6Q250OUdTQnJENDVRZkp6MkRUOGN1alVVOUhrX211SXFvajhsODZMMUZTSVNhY01nQ0M5aEVieDlHX3UyWUNYc1l5aXpTLWFNaUg0RnRsWDdkbjVjZ2hrS3JRMVJJZm50RVBPWQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="subtitle"&gt;
Study of CB1 receptor has implications for chronic pain treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;A research team funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has developed a medication that shows promise in treating acute and chronic pain. The drug, known as VIP36, targets the body’s cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1). It was found to be effective in three different animal models for pain and does not appear to cause the harmful side effects that have frustrated other efforts to target CB1. These results enhance understanding of how to design safer and more effective drugs targeting cannabinoid receptors and are an important step towards developing novel, non-addictive treatments for pain.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;CB1 receptors can be found throughout the body and are particularly dense in the brain’s pain circuitry. They have long been considered a potential target for non-opioid-based pain treatment; however, previous attempts to target this pathway have been met with two challenges. First, repeated exposure to a drug leads to tolerance that limits its efficacy. Second, the dose required to reduce pain in the periphery tends to be high enough for the drug to make its way into the central nervous system. In humans, this can cause unwanted changes in mood, cognition, or emotional state.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;To overcome these issues, researchers leveraged computer modeling of the CB1 receptor to design molecules that better interact with CB1, much like a key fitting into a lock.  The newly designed drug, VIP36, is more “peripherally restricted” compared to previous drugs, meaning that much less of it leaks into the central nervous system where it can cause unwanted side effects. VIP36 also interacts with CB1 differently than treatments tested previously and in a way that reduces tolerance.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;CB1 is part of a wide-ranging class of receptors known as G-protein-coupled receptors, which are involved in countless functions throughout the body including smell, vision, mood regulation, immune system responses, autonomic nervous system responses such as blood pressure and heart rate, and growth and metastasis of some tumors. In addition to their implications in pain care, the findings of this study could also help spur the design of other drugs that target similar receptors involved in other conditions.       &lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;This research was funded by NIH’s &lt;a href="https://heal.nih.gov"&gt;Helping to End Addiction Long-term® Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, or NIH HEAL Initiative®, an NIH-wide effort that seeks to speed scientific solutions to the overdose epidemic, including opioid and stimulant use disorders, and the crisis of chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;

showed people who were already taking a daily aspirin were more likely to survive if they were diagnosed with cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But how?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It appears to centre on a moment of vulnerability for a cancer - when a lone cell breaks off from the original tumour and tries, like a seed on the wind, to spread elsewhere in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;This process is called metastasis and is the cause of &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-020-0134-x" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;the majority of deaths&lt;/a&gt; from cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Part of our immune defences - a white blood cell called a T-cell - can swoop in and destroy the spreading cancer as it tries to take root.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But the study showed that another part of our blood - the platelets that normally stop bleeding - were suppressing the T-cells and making it harder for them to take out the cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Aspirin disrupts the platelets and removes their influence over the T-cells so they can hunt out the cancer.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prof Rahul Roychoudhuri, from the University of Cambridge, told me: "What we've discovered is that aspirin might work, surprisingly, by unleashing the power of the immune system to recognize and kill metastasizing cancer cells."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He thinks the drug would work best in cancers that have been caught early and could be used after treatment such as surgery to help the immune system find any cancer that might already have spread. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;Should I take aspirin for cancer?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The most natural question for anybody with cancer to ask is should they be taking aspirin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"If you are a cancer patient, don't rush to your local pharmacy to buy aspirin just yet, but actively consider participation in ongoing or upcoming trials of aspirin," says Prof Mangesh Thorat, a surgeon and cancer researcher at Queen Mary University of London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He says the study provided "the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle" in understanding how aspirin works, but there were still questions to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Aspirin can cause dangerous internal bleeding including strokes so the risks have to be balanced. It is also not clear whether the effect works for all cancer or just specific ones. And this is still animal research so while the scientists think this would apply in people that will still need to be confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Some patients - with Lynch syndrome, which increases the risk of cancers - are already &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng151/chapter/Recommendations" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;recommended aspirin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But it will still take proper clinical trials to understand whether more patients would benefit too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;These are already under way. Prof Ruth Langley, from the MRC Clinical Trials Unit at University College London, is leading the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.addaspirintrial.org/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Add-Aspirin trial&lt;/a&gt; to see if aspirin can stop early stage cancers from coming back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She said the study's results were "an important discovery" as they would help to work out "who is most likely to benefit from aspirin after a cancer diagnosis".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;However, she again warned of the risks of taking aspirin and to "always talk to your doctor before starting".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;In the long-run, Prof Roychoudhuri suspects new drugs would be developed that take the benefits of aspirin, but with fewer of the risky side-effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'Eureka moment'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The discovery, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08626-7" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;published in the journal Nature&lt;/a&gt;, happened by accident as the scientists were not researching aspirin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;The team in Cambridge were investigating how the immune system responded to cancers when they spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;They were using genetically engineered mice and found those lacking a specific set of genetic instructions were less likely to get metastatic cancer that had spread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Further investigation revealed how those T-cells were being suppressed and this started to overlap with how aspirin was known to work in the body. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Dr Jie Yang, who carried out the research, said: "It was a Eureka moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"It was an entirely unexpected finding which sent us down quite a different path of inquiry than we had anticipated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 16:03:07 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9VakJpOVJKRW5BSlcxOTBTTlVSVFZoZ20tWkZRQUtKenFGakdCMmhwUkxoRFRJVkRSZ2laWEhGQmZPLS1zVTgzVko0aldlV0trRkF5ZXB0U2tTd9IBX0FVX3lxTFBvOVRpazVTYWNtUlRWMUhiUW5OX25Pd3dZNW5zTWZwRlNXNWhvWHBmTzZTUFh5bEMxRi1pblp0LWFKdVpaMGlQNVlqcUpPTWVhVmwwTnRONVNnbkdrYzdn</guid></item><item><title>What People Are Getting Wrong This Week: Measles Myths - Lifehacker</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNMlQxNU95dng3cDNpQThUV01aeVl6U0xmUmEycld5eU4tY29fMUo4VGpiRUFaM1FLQVp4bC1VX0FLNnhuaHpyYlpDTnprYkd5bWV4MWNvWFhTOHdWSDdDZm5zeVBiM0Mxc013QlJNaHI3QVNoX0txanNlcWdwZmNnV0xiSUNQRWJEal80?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article class="editor-content" data-autopogo&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;A recent outbreak of measles in West Texas has resulted in 159 cases of the disease in the state so far; 22 victims required hospitalization, and one has died.  In response to the deadly outbreak, some Texas parents seem to be considering hosting "&lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/public-health/2025/03/03/texas-health-official-warns-against-measles-parties-amid-pleas-for-more-vaccinations/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;measles parties&lt;/a&gt;" instead of vaccinating their kids. Misinformation about measles can have deadly consequences, so here's a look at some ways people are getting measles wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="myth-measles-vaccines-are-potentially-dangerous"&gt;Myth: Measles vaccines are potentially dangerous&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4447805/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;small percentage of people suffer side effects&lt;/a&gt; from the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, they are almost always mild. The most common is a fever that hits between 5% and 10% of those vaccinated. About 2% to 5% develop a mild rash, and about 1 in 4,000 develop something more serious. The "side effects" of contracting the disease itself, on the other hand, are much worse: Nearly 100% of people who contract the disease develop symptoms that include fever, red eyes, a sore throat, and a blotchy rash. About one in 300 people who get measles will die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="myth-the-measles-vaccine-gives-people-measles"&gt;Myth: The measles vaccine &lt;em&gt;gives&lt;/em&gt; people measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The belief that measles outbreaks are caused&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;by the measles vaccine is growing in certain circles, helped along by advocates like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Health_Defense" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Children's Health Defense,&lt;/a&gt; the anti-vaccine advocacy group founded by Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The measles vaccine works by introducing a weakened form of the measles virus into the body to trigger an immune response. So the theory goes, people who have been injected with the measles vaccine are infecting others with the disease. But while the measles virus can potentially be detected in people for up to four weeks after a shot, it is extremely unlikely for the virus to be be transmitted to anyone in that weakened form—which is significant, given measles itself is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/resources/contagious-infographic.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;among the most contagious diseases&lt;/a&gt;. As for the Texas outbreak specifically, to make sure, all cases have been tested, and they've all been declared to be &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/texas-measles-outbreak-anti-vaccine-advocates-blame-shot-rcna193478" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;the result of "wild" measles&lt;/a&gt;. No one got it from vaccine "shedding," because that doesn't really happen with the measles vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="myth-the-measles-vaccine-is-linked-to-autism"&gt;Myth: The measles vaccine is linked to autism&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine for measles has been around since 1963. It has prevented countless cases of the diseases and has long been proven safe and effective. But people are still hesitant to take it and/or give it to their children. The belief that the measles vaccine, or any vaccine, can cause autism is one of the reasons. A &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/measles/1-4-us-adults-mistakenly-believe-mmr-vaccine-causes-autism-survey-reveals" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;recent survey&lt;/a&gt; conducted by the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center, found that 24% of Americans believe there is a link between vaccines and autism, and 3% aren't sure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The supposed link between autism and vaccination is based on two flawed studies that have been &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/autism-vaccine-link-debunked" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;thoroughly and overwhelmingly debunked&lt;/a&gt;. To put it simply, if you listen to the science, there's no there there. Vaccines for measles are safe and effective, and they prevent the disease and thus save lives. If enough people get vaccinated, we can eliminate measles from our country (in fact, the World Health Organization did declare it eradicated in the U.S. back in 2000, though as lower vaccination rates have recently resulted in more frequent outbreaks, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/measles-outbreaks-americas-risk-losing-elimination-status/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;that designation is at risk&lt;/a&gt;). It's really as simple as that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="myth-measles-can-be-cured-or-prevented-with-vitamin-a"&gt;Myth: Measles can be cured or prevented with vitamin A&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea that vitamin A can be used to treat measles has a grain of truth of it, but it's a small grain. &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7076287/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Studies conducted in developing nations&lt;/a&gt; indicate vitamin A can help prevent complications in severe measles cases, and that children with low amounts of vitamin A tend to develop more severe cases of measles. But in the United States, where few children have such nutritional deficiencies, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/vitamin-a-measles-virus-texas-cdc-what-know-rcna194288" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;it's unclear whether there's any benefit to giving vitamin A for measles&lt;/a&gt;. Some doctors' position is "why not?" but vitamin A is not part of the measles treatment protocol in the U.S., let alone a recognized cure or preventative measure. It's definitely not a substitute for vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To prevent measles cases in the current outbreak, public health officials are encouraging people to get vaccinated. One cool thing about the measles vaccine: As the Texas health department &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-march-4-2025" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, a dose can still be given within 72 hours &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; you are exposed to the virus to lessen the severity of the disease if you do get sick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="myth-measles-can-be-prevented-by-natural-means"&gt;Myth: Measles can be prevented by "natural means"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only "natural" way you can prevent the spread of measles is by staying away from other people if you are infected with it. Measles doesn't care if you eat healthy food and work out. It's &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; contagious—according to the CDC, "&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/index.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;if one person has it, up to 9 out of 10 people who are nearby will become infected if they are not protected&lt;/a&gt;." Being a generally healthy may result in a better outcome if you &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;infected, but not getting infected in the first place (by being vaccinated) is an infinitely healthier choice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="myth-measles-parties-can-help-kids-gain-natural-immunity"&gt;Myth: Measles parties can help kids gain "natural immunity"&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While surviving measles will protect you from reinfection, this "natural" immunity offers no more protection from the disease than vaccination, and, again, it's much riskier: About three out of every 1,000 people who get measles die (&lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/texas-announces-first-death-measles-outbreak" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;a tally that sadly included a child in Texas amid the current outbreak&lt;/a&gt;) and more suffer life-changing complications. As Dr. Ron Cook, chief health officer for the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock, put it in a &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/measles-parties-texas-outbreak/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;press conference&lt;/a&gt;, "We can’t predict who is going to do poorly with measles, being hospitalized, potentially get pneumonia or encephalitis, or potentially pass away. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It’s a foolish thing to go have measles parties," he added, I imagine with a pained sigh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="myth-the-current-measles-outbreak-is-normal"&gt;Myth: The current measles outbreak is normal&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deadly measles outbreaks &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; unusual in the U.S. Until this year, we hadn't had a child die from measles &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-west-texas-death-rfk-41adc66641e4a56ce2b2677480031ab9" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;since 2015&lt;/a&gt;. Heck, measles has been considered &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;eliminated from both North and South America since 2000&lt;/a&gt;. Since 2000, our measles outbreaks have been small and sporadic, started by travelers who brought a case in from overseas. Quick action from the CDC and from local health authorities has usually managed to get things back under control. But low rates of measles vaccination make it easier for these small outbreaks to spread to larger areas, and we may be looking at a new and growing problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with Texas, this year measles cases have been reported in &lt;a href="https://uknow.uky.edu/uk-healthcare/measles-found-kentucky-how-protect-your-children-and-yourself" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Kentucky,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://abc30.com/post/measles-outbreak-sweeps-states-including-california/15977977/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, New Mexico, Georgia, Alaska, New Jersey, and &lt;a href="https://6abc.com/post/measles-confirmed-unvaccinated-montgomery-county-child-members-public-may-have-been-exposed/15969940/" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, but there are less than 200 cases total, so it's unclear if the current wave is the beginning of a larger problem. But it isn't good. The fear is that the current climate of vaccine hesitancy and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/schoolvaxview/data/index.html?ldkjfdl" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;reduced vaccination rates&lt;/a&gt; will lower the percentage of immunized people enough that measles will reestablish a foothold in the U.S. According to the CDC a vaccination rate of 95% is needed for "herd immunity" but we're slipping below that magic number. Fourteen states have &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/health/402025/texas-measles-outbreak-cases-mmr-vaccination" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;fallen under 90 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="myth-you-cant-get-measles-if-youve-been-vaccinated"&gt;Myth: You can't get measles if you've been vaccinated&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine for measles is extremely effective (and safe) but it's not 100% effective. It's &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/questions.html" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;"only" 97% effective&lt;/a&gt;. No one knows why a small number of people get measles even though they've had shots. On the bright side, vaccinated people who suffer from "breakout" measles tend to have milder cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="myth-theres-nothing-we-can-do-about-rising-rates-of-measles"&gt;Myth: There's nothing we can do about rising rates of measles&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sudden spike in measles cases is alarming, but it's nothing compared to a measles outbreak that occurred in the early 1990s. That one was &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; worse, but it also provides historical evidence of how to combat a measles outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the vaccine was nearly 30 years old at that point, there were 27,000 cases of measles in the U.S. in 1990. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/Mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00001980.htm" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Low-income communities in New York City&lt;/a&gt; were hit hardest, although outbreaks were also reported in Philadelphia, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Houston. The root cause was the same as with the current rash of the disease: Not enough people were being vaccinated. In 1990, the CDC estimated that about half of all inner-city toddlers in New York City had not been vaccinated by their second birthday, mostly because the vaccine was difficult to get or difficult to afford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The response from city, state, and federal government included wide-ranging public outreach programs, mobile immunization centers, the creation of the federal, congressionally approved Vaccines for Children Program, pro vaccine messages flashed in Times Square, and even &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/05/13/722944146/how-public-health-outreach-ended-a-1990s-measles-outbreak-and-whats-different-no" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;Michelangelo from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&lt;/a&gt; emerging from a sewer to encourage kids to get vaccinated. In short, we really threw everything we had at pro-vaccine, anti-measles messaging. And it worked: Vaccination rates &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2017/066.pdf" target="_blank" title="open in a new window" rel="noopener"&gt;climbed above 90% in New York&lt;/a&gt;. Whether a similar effort would work in today's climate of distrust and misinformation is an open question, but at least there's evidence vaccination &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; worked to contain an outbreak once before.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/article&gt;

Researchers argue that noise provides valuable insights into cognitive processes, from decision-making to moral reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By applying computational models, they show how different types of noise can reflect distinct cognitive mechanisms, rather than random mistakes.

Human behavior varies not only between people, but within separate instances for one individual as well.  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study of that individual variability, called “noise” by many psychologists, is the topic of focus in a special issue of &lt;em&gt;Perspectives on Psychological Science&lt;/em&gt;, published in March 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108046"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/03/psychological-noise-behavior-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Is that noise an error in our cognitive processes or does it actually help us perform better? Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joakim Sundh and his coauthors from Uppsala University set the stage for this discussion by first providing an historical review of how noise has previously been studied in psychological research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They argue that noise is typically studied as an external factor that needs to be minimized rather than an internal factor that can provide information about the process being studied.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All noise has a source, and different sources of noise can give rise to different expressions of noise,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If these different sources of noise are associated with distinct processes, then one can use the way noise is expressed in data to draw conclusions regarding those processes.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sundh and his team also describe their own research with their Precise/Not Precise (PNP) model, which was developed to help determine how different sources of noise are associated with different psychological processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They apply the PNP model to three experiments, illustrating how distributions of noise can be studied to determine analytic and intuitive ways of reasoning (&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/17456916241235889" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sundh et al., 2025&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors end by previewing the three additional contributions to the special issue, concluding that each of the papers “represent excellent example of the possibilities inherent in using noise to inform scientific inquiry by treating it as a source of information.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adam Sanborn and his team from the University of Warwick expand on this discussion by exploring the purpose of noise in the human thought process.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Asking participants to perform the same task on multiple occasions, even when those occasions are close together in time, produces surprisingly noisy behavior,” the authors wrote.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is that noise an error in our cognitive processes or does it actually help us perform better?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer this question, Sanborn and his coauthors discuss the role of noise throughout the stages of information processing, from perception to computation to response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They argue that it is more accurate to view noise as a feature of cognitive processing rather than a glitch that disrupts it (&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/17456916241258951" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sanborn et al., 2025&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not only could one say that ‘noise’ in cognition is a feature and not a bug, but even that it is an essential feature, which underpins our ability to deal with an uncertain world of such complexity that precise analysis is computationally impossible,” Sanborn and his coauthors wrote.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though noisy behavior is widely acknowledged as inevitable, in many cases it is preferable for individuals to be consistent in how they categorize information. For example, a doctor assessing for the presence of skin cancer is expected to make a consistent and correct diagnosis every time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their study, Florian Seitz (University of Basel) and his coauthors work to better understand the ways noise can be reduced as individuals categorize information.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, they present a simulation that accounts for possible sources of behavioral variability during the process of perceiving and processing information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their simulation Seitz and colleagues used two common category structures: (1) rule-based structures where a category is based on a single feature, and (2) information-integration structures where a category is determined by multiple features that are considered simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers argue that by integrating continuous data into experiments that assess categorization, researchers may be better able to identify the sources of behavioral noise and categorize the cognitive processes at play (&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/17456916241264259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Seitz et al., 2025&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Assessing people’s category beliefs in a continuous way may therefore help disentangle perceptual and process-related sources of behavioral variability,” Seitz and his team wrote, adding that this finding could inform both future cognitive models and applied interventions.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by recent chaotic responses to current events like the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing campaigns of misinformation, APS Fellow Michel Regenwetter and his team from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign explore the presence of irrational moral judgement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They use the concept of transitivity as a foundation for their discussion. This philosophical concept is used in discussions of morality as a kind of logic equation— the understanding that if A is better than B, and B is better than C, then A is better than C. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regenwetter and his coauthors investigate whether participants can be described by the principle of transitivity, despite the large amount of variation in their behavior. Their study included 28 participants from the Urbana-Champaign, Illinois, area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each participant was presented with a survey of 126 moral vignettes, each of which was accompanied by a binary-choice question. For each vignette, they were instructed to choose the option that was “worse” or the most “morally wrong.”  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on their sample, the team found that participants did adhere to transitive moral thinking, suggesting that a shared set of moral principles underlies how people judge the moral value of one item over another (&lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/17456916241260611" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Regenwetter et al., 2025&lt;/a&gt;).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Despite the amazing heterogeneity of behavior in the world around us, there may be order underneath the chaos,” they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this psychology and behavioral neuroscience research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bfd7ddcdd0c8d1ffcfccc6dcd7d0d3d0d8d6dcded3ccdcd6dad1dcda91d0cdd8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Hannah Brown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://psychologicalscience.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;APS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Hannah Brown – APS&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 14:20:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE5IZlFsRGF5RGNyeGNuM3Z2czJjZmlOOHcyMjZ5RmxYTzdDSUlmMURKQmxvY1ZRZHE5VVRYUE9yNHNwTG9VYXFfWE9aZkVZQnBMbFFZR2phLXcwOTdBaXRLRENObllTR0RvUGQ0Mjljc2lLZw</guid></item><item><title>Brain-eating fungus causes the immune system to attack neurons - Earth.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMirgFBVV95cUxNVnRTbGNYSHZuSjlySzRSaVpwNTh3RjBCdGZlcld2OUVJY0dHSl9WOXA3MnB5OVE2ZXl3V2NxcVNXWkp1VHlPRE1PbUNleUY5WEZFeHpHazNab01VMmt3OUs1TXhKZEx6eUpZOFRsanVNQmltY2loelJoU19mY0NMeDNMT0djQTVYRjBjUmd1THEzd0VJUWZDY2xzRHNzaVRvQVVDSzlVQnB5YlM5c0E?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="page_content__AwOj6"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infections often conjure images of bacteria or viruses, but certain fungi can also take their toll on us. They can hide in unsuspecting corners of the environment and interact with living organisms in ways that raise many questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One particular fungus, &lt;em&gt;Beauveria bassiana&lt;/em&gt;, has captured attention because of its interactions with insects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its spores settle on an insect and then germinate and penetrate through the cuticle. The insect dies within days and forms the substrate for a white fungal mold that grows and flourishes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/biosciences/hidalgo-alicia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Prof. Alicia Hidalgo&lt;/a&gt;, from the University of Birmingham, directed a recent investigation into infections in insects by this devastating fungus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-immune-responses-to-brain-fungus"&gt;Immune responses to brain fungus&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fruit flies became the chosen subjects for this study because their immune system shares some features with that of more complex creatures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers often turn to these small insects when exploring disease processes in a simple model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers analyzed the effect of the fungus on the brains of flies and found that flies infected with &lt;em&gt;B. bassiana&lt;/em&gt; suffered a reduction in the number of brain cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They identified that the fly’s own immune system was “tricked” by the invading fungus to start destroying brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In flies, Toll receptors are agents of the immune system. When infected with the fungus, the Toll-1 receptors in the flies triggered the release of antimicrobial peptides that attack and kill pathogens. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the fungus also provoked the Toll-1 receptors to produce another molecule, called Sarm, that suppresses the immune response and destroys brain cells instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have shown a process for how &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/plants-and-fungi-communicate-using-a-silent-language/"&gt;fungi&lt;/a&gt; have evolved to trick the immune system to get into the brain,” said Prof. Hidalgo. Her findings suggest that a normal line of defense can accidentally turn against the very organ it’s meant to protect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-sarm-s-link-to-neurodegeneration"&gt;Sarm’s link to neurodegeneration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the immune system tries to confront this fungus, the &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2738257/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Sarm&lt;/a&gt; molecules step up their activity; they have the potential to sabotage defenses by encouraging cell damage in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The key antagonist in the immune process is Sarm&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;a so-called master of destruction, that is causing cell death in the brain. The ability of &lt;em&gt;B. bassiana &lt;/em&gt;to trick the fruit fly immune system into activating the master of destruction Sarm and kill&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;cells enables spores to beat the blood-brain barrier and start feeding on brain cells,” commented Hidalgo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process, known as neurodegeneration, describes the gradual breakdown of nerve cells. If immune signals become confused, the result might be nerve destruction in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts note that this fungus, though hazardous to insects, is widely used for insect management in agriculture. It is developed into a type of pesticide and used to kills certain insects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings offer a curious look at how a single microbe might manipulate host biology for its own benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-does-this-fungus-mean-for-humans"&gt;What does this fungus mean for humans?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is important to stress that &lt;em&gt;B. bassiana&lt;/em&gt; cannot affect humans,” explained &lt;a href="https://web-cdn.bsky.app/profile/did:plc:d6rwoejbzaavw4wcxlydd6un" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Dr. Deepanshu Singh&lt;/a&gt;, now a post-doc at the University of Manchester. The fungus targets insects, but it stays clear of mammals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/fungi-can-think-and-make-smart-decisions-without-a-brain/"&gt;other fungi&lt;/a&gt; are known to reach the human brain under certain conditions. These discoveries hint that parallel strategies might pop up in different species, especially when fungal organisms are trying to survive inside a host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-a-broader-perspective-on-fungal-threats"&gt;A broader perspective on fungal threats&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some scientists believe that future work could explore whether similar immune system misdirection happens in other animals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding how these pathogens find loopholes in the immune system may help researchers develop new interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fungal infections often get less attention than bacterial or viral illnesses, yet they can still pose serious threats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The possibility that a fungus might slip into the human central nervous system and confuse its defenses encourages further research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-implications-for-neurodegenerative-diseases"&gt;Implications for neurodegenerative diseases&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discovery that a fungal infection can manipulate immune responses to attack brain cells raises questions about similar mechanisms in humans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, involve &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-tiny-bacteria-outsmart-the-human-immune-system/"&gt;immune system&lt;/a&gt; dysfunction and excessive inflammation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If certain pathogens can trigger destructive immune pathways, this could offer new insights into how inflammation contributes to neurodegeneration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers may investigate whether similar immune evasion tactics occur in human infections, potentially linking fungal exposure to long-term neurological effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-possible-next-steps-in-fungal-research"&gt;Possible next steps in fungal research&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists hope to identify molecules that can protect nerve cells when the immune system is tricked. Pinpointing the exact signals could spark novel medical approaches for people at risk of certain &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/orchid-parents-nurture-seedlings-through-fungal-networks/"&gt;fungal&lt;/a&gt; infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research also continues on ways to control fungal spread in agricultural settings without harming beneficial insects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;B. bassiana&lt;/em&gt; remains a useful tool for pest management, though its tactics highlight the complexity of the microbe-host relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3003020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PLOS Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 14:10:32 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxNVnRTbGNYSHZuSjlySzRSaVpwNTh3RjBCdGZlcld2OUVJY0dHSl9WOXA3MnB5OVE2ZXl3V2NxcVNXWkp1VHlPRE1PbUNleUY5WEZFeHpHazNab01VMmt3OUs1TXhKZEx6eUpZOFRsanVNQmltY2loelJoU19mY0NMeDNMT0djQTVYRjBjUmd1THEzd0VJUWZDY2xzRHNzaVRvQVVDSzlVQnB5YlM5c0E</guid></item><item><title>Anxiety and Apathy Affect Decision-Making in Opposite Ways - Neuroscience News</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibkFVX3lxTE1kNzJSWDMxcTVDZTdqV1M1RG5aQ1BmOVRyWEJOVEUwaHNhWHNiUkg5c0VfSm9oZGJGV0F5cDg5eG9Yc0FhejBQb3pEeUJhOXFXQ1NMM09CWGN4aDhieGpVcXRRSktEeTdEcDRIRENB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content body-color clearfix link-color-wrap"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary: &lt;/strong&gt;A new study reveals that anxiety and apathy lead to fundamentally different patterns in decision-making under uncertainty. Anxious individuals perceive their environment as highly volatile, leading them to explore more options, especially after negative outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, apathetic individuals view outcomes as random, reducing their willingness to explore new choices. These findings highlight the need for tailored therapeutic approaches that account for how patients perceive and process uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anxiety and Decision-Making:&lt;/strong&gt; Anxious individuals perceive more volatility and explore more after failures.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apathy and Exploration:&lt;/strong&gt; Apathetic individuals see outcomes as random and reduce exploratory behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings suggest therapies should be tailored to patients’ uncertainty perceptions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;University of Minnesota&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making decisions in uncertain situations is part of daily life. New research from the University of Minnesota Medical School has uncovered that anxiety and apathy — two common but distinct emotional states — lead to fundamentally different patterns in how people learn and make decisions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings were recently published in &lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study investigated how anxiety and apathy — or a lack of interest and enthusiasm — affects people’s perception of uncertainty and their subsequent decision-making behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a combination of behavioral experiments and computational modeling, researchers examined how more than 1,000 participants made choices in a dynamic environment where they had to repeatedly decide between exploring new options or sticking with familiar ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While anxiety and apathy often occur simultaneously in clinical conditions, our findings show they actually lead to opposite patterns in how people process uncertainty and make decisions,” said Alexander Herman, MD, PhD, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the U of M Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This helps explain why these conditions might require different therapeutic approaches.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key findings include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anxious individuals perceive higher environmental volatility and explore more options, especially after negative outcomes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apathetic individuals view outcomes as more random and show reduced exploratory behavior&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ratio of perceived volatility to randomness mediates the relationship between anxiety and exploratory behavior&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;“These emotional states affect both openness to new experiences and perceptions of unpredictability of the world,” said Xinyuan Yan, PhD, a postdoctoral fellow at the U of M Medical School and the study’s lead author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For example, an anxious person might view the job market as unpredictable and requiring constant vigilance — obsessively checking job boards despite rejections. Someone experiencing apathy might see job searching as random, using the same resume — believing changes won’t matter.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research provides a new framework for understanding how emotional states influence decision-making, with important implications for treating neuropsychiatric conditions. The findings suggest that therapeutic approaches might be more effective if tailored to how patients perceive and process uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;This research was funded by the National Institutes of Mental Health [R21MH127607], National Institute on Drug Abuse [K23DA050909] and the University of Minnesota’s MnDRIVE initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this mental health and decision making research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#01602c726c68756941746c6f2f646574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alexandra Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://umn.edu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;University of Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Alexandra Smith – University of Minnesota&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2025.01.005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Distinct computational mechanisms of uncertainty processing explain opposing exploratory behaviors in anxiety and apathy&lt;/a&gt;” by Alexander Herman et al. &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biological Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Distinct computational mechanisms of uncertainty processing explain opposing exploratory behaviors in anxiety and apathy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0015"&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decision-making in uncertain environments can lead to varied outcomes, and how we process those outcomes may depend on our emotional state. Understanding how individuals interpret the sources of uncertainty is crucial for understanding adaptive behavior and mental well-being. Uncertainty can be broadly categorized into two components: volatility and stochasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volatility describes how quickly conditions change. Stochasticity, on the other hand, refers to outcome randomness. We investigated how anxiety and apathy influenced people’s perceptions of uncertainty, and how uncertainty perception shaped explore-exploit decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0020"&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants (N = 1001, non-clinical sample) completed a restless three-armed bandit task that was analyzed using both latent state and process models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0025"&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anxious individuals perceived uncertainty as resulting more from volatility, leading to &lt;em&gt;increased&lt;/em&gt; exploration and learning rates, especially after reward omission. Conversely, apathetic individuals viewed uncertainty as more stochastic, resulting in &lt;em&gt;decreased&lt;/em&gt; exploration and learning rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perceived volatility-to-stochasticity ratio mediated the anxiety-exploration relationship post-adverse outcomes. Dimensionality reduction showed exploration and uncertainty estimation to be distinct but related latent factors shaping a manifold of adaptive behavior that is modulated by anxiety and apathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sectitle0030"&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings reveal distinct computational mechanisms for how anxiety and apathy influence decision-making, providing a framework for understanding cognitive and affective processes in neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

But let’s take a step back: There’s a bad &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a good kind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Inflammation is often mentioned as a dirty word, but it can be lifesaving if you have an infection,” says Robert Shmerling, MD, clinical chief of rheumatology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The protective stuff he’s referring to is acute inflammation, which is the temporary redness, pain, and swelling that crop up as the result of, say, a bug bite or a sprained ankle. Chronic inflammation, on the other hand, is the naughty player, and the one experts are referring to when they talk about inflammation as a main driver of disease. It’s like a slow burn in the immune system, simmering over time and silently wreaking havoc on organs, joints, and blood vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the experts:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/authors/robert-h-shmerling-md" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Robert Shmerling, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Robert Shmerling, MD&lt;/a&gt;, is the clinical chief of rheumatology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School. &lt;a href="https://www.hss.edu/physicians_metzl-jordan.asp" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Jordan Metzl, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Jordan Metzl, MD&lt;/a&gt;, is a sports medicine physician at the Hospital for Special Surgery. &lt;a href="https://jamesgraymd.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:James Gray, MD;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;James Gray, MD&lt;/a&gt;, is a cardiologist with Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truth: You can defend against chronic inflammation on your own, no gimmicks required. Just familiarize yourself with the proven health habits that help keep chronic inflammation under control ahead, then adjust your habits (but for real this time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Do your best to get at least seven hours of sleep most nights.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You snuggle in bed with your love (that is, your iPad with the HBO app open) at 11 and pass out during episode three. Next thing you know? Your 6 a.m. alarm is popping off. You’re not getting enough shut-eye, which means you could be fanning chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing sleep to four hours for just one night has been shown to elevate inflammatory markers in the body, research has shown. (No surprise, then, that sleep deprivation is associated with elevated risks for hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try this: &lt;/strong&gt;Most adults need seven to nine hours a night. (Yeah, yeah, you know this.) So your goal now is to, er, actually make that happen. Try the reverse alarm: Just like you set an alarm to wake up, schedule a lights-out alert to nudge yourself to your pillow—sans gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Floss regularly (for real!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inflammation associated with gingivitis and gum disease appears to be linked to chronic inflammation elsewhere in the body. Other recurring infections (e.g., &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a18714095/uti-symptoms-in-women/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UTIs;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;UTIs&lt;/a&gt;) may also be connected to widespread internal damage, though it’s unclear why. Gum disease stands out, though, because it’s common and doesn’t necessarily cause glaring symptoms, so not everyone takes it seriously and gets it treated, Dr. Shmerling explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try this:&lt;/strong&gt; Standard string-cleaning-turned-bloody-gums doesn’t make this aspect of dental care any more inviting. We get it. But not all flosses are created equal. Shop around and ask your dentist for recs that feel gentle on the gums, as opposed to sharp and plastic-like. Just can’t commit to the string kind? Try tiny interdental brushes (the mini bristles may be more pleasant) or a water flosser. When flossing doesn’t feel like torture, Dr. Shmerling says, you’re more likely to do it twice a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Woven Dental Floss&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084RSJZY6?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.64040296%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$36.00 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$36.00 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cordless Rechargeable Portable Water Flosser&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09C2QZQFQ?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.64040296%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$69.99 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$69.99 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Glide Ultra Deep Clean Floss Picks&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DJFWS5DV?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.64040296%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$14.91 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$14.91 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Practice regular workout recovery.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don't know for certain yet if your power barre class is any better or worse for icing the internal burn than a &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g30985585/hiit-workout-at-home/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:HIIT session;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;HIIT session&lt;/a&gt; or run. But we do know that consistent moderate physical activity is probably one of the top ways to quell chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, overexerting yourself during all workouts and skipping rest time impedes your body’s healing process and can backfire: “Chronic inflammation can promote tissue breakdown and encourage muscle atrophy,” says Jordan Metzl, MD, a sports medicine physician at the Hospital for Special Surgery. (Rest day, is that you?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try this: &lt;/strong&gt;There’s no be-all and end-all rehab prescription to undo inflammation from workout overload. Slate regular days off and plan for other forms of physical recovery (such as massage, foam rolling, and hot and cold therapy) that work for you to balance out intense sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Implement consistent stress-management tools into your life.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stress has been connected to heart disease, heart attacks, diabetes, and frequent infections—and inflammation in the system is thought to be the bridge for all. Anger, too, may elevate inflammatory markers, according to a new study by the American Psychological Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try this: &lt;/strong&gt;Deliberately planning for taxing or irritating situations could help buffer the negative feels before they hit, research shows. “Stress is more of a perceived reaction,” says James Gray, MD, a cardiologist with Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine. “The situation doesn’t change, but you can alter how you respond.” In your calendar, use another color to highlight events you anticipate being emotionally demanding, so you can make a mental note about what’s coming, prepare your mind, and schedule extra self-care time accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Prioritize eating whole foods.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably seen the term “&lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a38148129/anti-inflammatory-diet-benefits-tips/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:anti-inflammatory diet;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;anti-inflammatory diet&lt;/a&gt;.” But the eating regimen doesn’t need such a formal title (#marketing).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This diet doesn’t have one specific outline, but more generally includes foods that support the body by providing the vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that keep our systems working properly, says Ginger Hultin, RDN, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try this:&lt;/strong&gt; Living by basic nutritious eating rules—going hard in the produce aisle, dialing back on white bread—means your diet is on its way to being anti-inflammatory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How To Know If Your Inflammation Levels Are In A Healthy Range&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can’t exactly see or feel chronic inflammation; it’s happening internally. So you may wonder if you need some sort of workup from an MD to scan for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer: not if you’re healthy, says Dr. Shmerling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no easy, reliable way to know if heat is building, and the medical tests available are really meant for people with known risk factors for chronic illnesses associated with inflammation, like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. (The most common scan for inflammatory markers like these is the C-reactive protein test.) You don’t need a high-tech exam if you’re owning our advice and seeing a doc for your usual checkups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 13:14:46 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMieEFVX3lxTE10clMxSTB4WS1HUy1pLUF3RG90Skd0djZmSFJ2empINE02a2VBRGRCZ2J0a3VmNWpfSEJRaWtwMEtFanFTMUxsRDlvZUNfZW1PVHF6cmRwNmZZbXZfTzNMb1BBalFaWkNwMUg0VlZ4ZFNzejU2M3NHZQ</guid></item><item><title>I've Taken Antidepressants For 20 Years.

I changed into a gown and beige grippy socks in a hallway with a flimsy curtain drawn around an alcove. Stripped of my clothing and my dignity, I was escorted into the hospital psych ward, where I was left on my own for over an hour to stare at the walls and listen to the distressed voices of the other patients. They were elsewhere in their own little rooms, also bare of anything they could use to hurt themselves.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span&gt;I’m not crazy, right? I mean, I don’t belong here, do I?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt; It was a momentary snap out of the deep depression and spiraling thoughts that I had been experiencing for the previous month. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;When I had told my mom earlier that day that I was having thoughts of suicide, she called my primary care doctor’s office. They refused to see me and told her to take me directly to the emergency room. There I also told staff I was considering ending my life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When the psychiatrist arrived, he saw a young woman of 23 who had her prime childbearing years ahead of her. At least, that’s what he must have seen, because what he told me was that I was at risk for postpartum depression, a bizarre observation to make to someone who was most definitely not pregnant. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Worse, that warning was all he would provide. Since I didn’t come in on the heels of a suicide attempt — only with suicidal ideation — there was no place for me in the hospital. He refused to prescribe any medication. I was discharged and sent home with a several thousand dollar ER bill.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Three years prior, I had been prescribed an antidepressant for the first time. I had been experiencing what I now know was depression and anxiety for a number of years. But mental health wasn’t really something that was discussed in my family. And in our conservative Christian circles, where mental health issues were seen as a result of not having enough faith, taking medication was actively disparaged. It was only when my parents saw my paralyzing anxiety growing and heard me crying myself to sleep at night that it was considered as an option. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And antidepressants did help, until several years later when a doctor (who wasn’t a psychiatrist) convinced me I should go off medication. Since I was surrounded by a community and had a boyfriend who stigmatized and shamed me for taking an antidepressant, it seemed like a good idea at the time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The results were devastating. Due to the combination of going off the medication and a breakup with the aforementioned boyfriend, I plunged into a depression and extreme anxiety unlike any I had ever experienced before.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;I was at the bottom of a deep, dark hole and couldn’t see my way out. Therapy on its own wasn’t working because the depression felt so oppressive. I couldn’t take advantage of exercise to boost my mood because most days it was an accomplishment to simply get out of bed. I felt so hopeless and filled with self-hatred that I wondered what the point was anymore. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;My visit to the ER was my first taste of how broken the mental healthcare system is in our country. You can be begging for help, only to have doctors refuse to see you and others send you home with no resources. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, I had people that were in the position to advocate for me and find me help, because I was not in the place to do it myself. I spent two weeks in an outpatient program at a psychiatric hospital. I was numb, simply going through the motions. I can’t really tell you what the benefits of that program were other than it gave me access to prescriptions and an appointment with a psychiatrist to see after the program was over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trying to go back on the original antidepressant didn’t work. So I spent months trying to find the appropriate psychiatrist and medications that would allow me to function and actually participate in life again. One of the medications that finally helped was a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, or SSRI — an antidepressant that increases levels of serotonin in the brain. That SSRI saved my life. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being on an SSRI didn’t cure me of the depression and anxiety. But it did clear the fog, help manage the symptoms, and give me a light and ladder out of that deep, dark hole I was in. A hole that made me feel worthless and had me questioning whether my life had meaning or whether everyone else would be better off without me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;SSRIs allowed me to function again. I could eat, sleep and concentrate. I could work again: first part time and eventually full time. They got me to a place where I could actually participate in therapy so I could dive into the underlying causes of depression and work on techniques to combat anxiety when it occurred. I could take a walk out in the fresh air without feeling exhausted after five minutes. I could spend time with friends and actually laugh without feeling dead inside. I was hopeful about the future again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;SSRIs are responsible for another life as well — my daughter’s. Without them, I would have never met her father or been able to consider having children. But after her birth, the words that the ER doctor had spoken almost 10 years prior were fulfilled — unfortunately, I did experience postpartum depression (and anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder). And the medication that I had been taking for almost as long stopped working.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days after my daughter was born, it really set in. One night, she screamed and fed the entire time. I was tired — so, so tired. I didn’t want to hear her cry anymore. It felt like she was screaming at me that I was a bad mom. I was exhausted, which triggered more anxiety and the feeling of being so nauseous that I couldn’t eat. On one drive home alone from the store, I was weighing the options of just driving away and never coming back or driving into a building and ending it all. I felt like my daughter and husband would be better off without me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;It got so bad that I felt like I was crawling out of my skin. I hadn’t slept in a week; I was hardly eating anything. I called my psychiatrist for help to find a new medication, then called my mom to come help take care of my daughter for the weekend because I felt incapable of even taking care of myself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While it took months for me to get to a better place, my new antidepressant and other complementary medications are the reason I’m still here six years later. They’re the reason that my daughter has a mom. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So when I read the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="“Make America Healthy Again” executive order" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67bdfe29e4b0d509934a6b58" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/establishing-the-presidents-make-america-healthy-again-commission/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="0"&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Make America Healthy Again” executive order&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, which states that the current administration will be “assessing the prevalence of and threat posed by” drugs such as SSRIs, antipsychotics and mood stabilizers, I wanted to vomit. A friend texted me, “He can’t really take our meds, right?” when she heard that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a man with no medical background and a known vaccine skeptic, had been confirmed as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the executive order specifically refers to investigating what it believes is the overprescribing of these drugs to children, I am not naive enough to believe that it will stop there. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When Kennedy was asked about his stance on antidepressants during his confirmation hearing, he responded that they are “more difficult to come off than heroin,” which is &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/30/nx-s1-5281164/antidepressants-ssris-rfk-jr-heroin" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="blatantly false" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67bdfe29e4b0d509934a6b58" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/01/30/nx-s1-5281164/antidepressants-ssris-rfk-jr-heroin" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="1"&gt;blatantly false&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, he also hypothesized that the rise in school shootings could be related to antidepressant use, a statement that also &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31513302/" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="has no scientific backing" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67bdfe29e4b0d509934a6b58" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31513302/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="2"&gt;has no scientific backing&lt;/a&gt;. And in his first speech to HHS staff, he directly referenced SSRIs and psychiatric drugs as a factor that will be investigated as a cause for a rise in chronic diseases. This is a man who has expressed the desire to send people like us to “wellness camps” to detox from our meds and treat our mental health problems with farm work and organic vegetables. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who has anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder, it is hard not to agonize over even the possibility of access to my medications being denied. But even without outright bans, both Kennedy’s and &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/news/topic/donald-trump"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;’s policies and statements make clear that they believe that mentally ill, disabled, neurodivergent and chronically ill individuals are a drain on the United States’ resources. This is concerning and also eerily reminiscent of other times in history &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-psychiatric-treatment/article/psychiatry-and-the-dark-side-eugenics-nazi-and-soviet-psychiatry/5A5950F52D74D0B5FC5418642C5211D1" target="_blank" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="when eugenic ideologies prevailed" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67bdfe29e4b0d509934a6b58" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/advances-in-psychiatric-treatment/article/psychiatry-and-the-dark-side-eugenics-nazi-and-soviet-psychiatry/5A5950F52D74D0B5FC5418642C5211D1" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="3"&gt;when eugenic ideologies prevailed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking medication for mental illness already holds a fair amount of stigma. Many people already feel ashamed for taking medications for their mental health; many more may not even consider medication as an option for fear of being judged or stereotyped as crazy or weak. That is only going to increase as a result of this mindset, along with the stigma surrounding mental illness in general.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because if you believe that mental illness is not real illness, that depression can be vanquished with a little fresh air and time spent with friends, or that anxiety is a result of “unresolved sin” or not enough faith, then medication is not needed at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This will undoubtedly result in fewer individuals seeking out the treatment they need. And like I almost did, people will lose their lives as a result.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id="support-huffpost-entry" class="cli support-huffpost-mid-article primary-cli cli cli-text cli-support-huffpost"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__content-wrapper"&gt;&lt;h4 class="cli-support-huffpost__title"&gt;Go Ad-Free — And Protect The Free Press&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message-container"&gt;&lt;div class="cli-support-huffpost__message support-huffpost-control"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next four years will change America forever.

If there’s some new virus circulating, you’ll know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Doctors might have more specific readouts of what viruses and bacteria are circulating in their communities, so they would know what to look for in exam rooms, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Among people who analyze wastewater, there has been a call to standardize how samples are collected and analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“The more it is standardized, the easier it will be to draw direct comparisons between different places,” Johnson said. “It’s going to be hard, though. We have the CDC, but really, we have 50 states that each have their own health departments that make their own decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Setting up a global system would help track pathogens as soon as they emerge. Officials can also look back at archived samples, as the CDC researchers did in the report last week, to see if a variant arrived in recent weeks or months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Yet the Trump administration has halted federal and international funding for research and fired many employees tasked with tracking outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Trump has also announced his intention to withdraw from the World Health Organization, which means the US would be further isolated from global experts tracking and responding to disease outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“This kind of study is a testament to the fact that international collaboration is crucial,” Vespignani said. “There is no border for viruses, and if we want to have a good grasp on the circulation of pathogens, we need to work collaboratively in the international community. There is no other way to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Wastewater monitoring was “the next generation” approach for understanding infectious diseases, Vespignani said, before adding: “Our effort is towards not being blindsided by another pathogen in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 13:01:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxQQ1cyR1BiTkFheGIydXJmaUEwSE5MckV2VWo5OE92RzFtbmtFellCRmFrOWtyd0pFeUEzOFNjZHRhY0VaLVkzTnkweUtHYmxzOFlxSXl2RDhPODZQdWVGUHhQNmdMUEV1MTkzVFlLRElReWhWbFpjcnRHNlA4U3cxTDNSYW1PbUE</guid></item><item><title>Paxlovid may not reduce hospitalization risk for vaccinated older adults - The Washington Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMipgFBVV95cUxNM0JrTEdXYkZzbDdNbWFjdVBMZzF1Tkg3TjJSbDY2SEpqdnB0MUlYZHhuTmJDcmFUWm95QXg0SW1qUDNzTGw4OUZXOUFILThYTXpzRGJkQkdLNnRfTXhzUGp1eHBQaEpvSU5WM3h6Zm94VS1SQTJDelRWclJoNGFjSFRybnVLMnAyd2V3aXpQOHRpbkVzSndJX09TdXVDS1dOakFGVnFB?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="meteredContent grid-center"&gt;&lt;div class="teaser-content"&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="DUGPZRQ24FDCFD5UBPHGM53WAI" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Paxlovid, the five-day antiviral treatment for covid, may not reduce the risk of covid-related hospitalizations and all-cause deaths in vaccinated older adults, a new &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2830683"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="WLETF6OXUNAFZPP7BBIHNFOFCA" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;Paxlovid — Pfizer’s combination of nirmatrelvir and ritonavir — has been found to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35172054/"&gt;reduce&lt;/a&gt; symptoms, hospitalizations and deaths in unvaccinated, at-risk patients.

Paxlovid may not have been as effective for them as it would have been for a person who was sicker with covid, said Jena, who was not involved in the JAMA study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="46ALXQ7FWVCRNLWD4QPPNBDBEY" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;&lt;a href="https://profiles.ucsf.edu/peter.chin-hong"&gt;Peter Chin-Hong&lt;/a&gt;, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of California at San Francisco, who wasn’t involved in the research, said the population studied doesn’t include people most at risk of ending up in the hospital — adults 75 and older who haven’t been recently vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="wpds-c-PJLV article-body type-text" data-qa="article-body"&gt;&lt;p data-testid="drop-cap-letter" data-apitype="text" data-contentid="2ILT3XLNK5FLJLXGV3QSWOZZ5Y" data-el="text" class="wpds-c-heFNVF wpds-c-heFNVF-iPJLV-css overrideStyles font-copy" dir="null"&gt;“I can’t extend the findings of this data to that population,” Chin-Hong said. “It isn’t addressing the people who are in the hospital in the last year or two.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Washington Post</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 12:32:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgFBVV95cUxNM0JrTEdXYkZzbDdNbWFjdVBMZzF1Tkg3TjJSbDY2SEpqdnB0MUlYZHhuTmJDcmFUWm95QXg0SW1qUDNzTGw4OUZXOUFILThYTXpzRGJkQkdLNnRfTXhzUGp1eHBQaEpvSU5WM3h6Zm94VS1SQTJDelRWclJoNGFjSFRybnVLMnAyd2V3aXpQOHRpbkVzSndJX09TdXVDS1dOakFGVnFB</guid></item><item><title>Instead of vaccines, RFK Jr. focuses on unconventional measles treatments, driving worries about misinformation - CNN</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMijgFBVV95cUxNUm9ZdW1LaUE3MUpwZ21iRTJld3BzazctSW0xQ3g1RUhJbGRtVnctLV90RUp4YXR6aG1UTmgxYk0yeGt6MGRKTUdISVBzVTZFRERKc0VNLUs1dFZYc1NDbVl6QjRMM3FHWDVZTkNxZWYxRk1DTTB6ZWl5R1RsN0U3MjVZdkZ2ZU5vaktnbzdn0gGEAUFVX3lxTE80OXlaVUpEYU52QVhBaTRiX1J5bXk2Rlo1WXVQWXJPaWpjOUFFRFRBMWxDOHFQWlMteUhSb1RPZVBHb2FrSXpZWDhPLWtNVGdNS3hhVGRac1lFcGplMHNLMFRfYjlBNE0wMlJHU2d2NGhkalZZclJlZlRQZTRGOWI1SHFzOQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            As a measles outbreak in West Texas continues to grow, the response from US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has leaned heavily on treatment with vitamin A, as well as “good results” from the use of the steroid budesonide, the antibiotic clarithromycin and cod liver oil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7uxzy3b00023b5vev1grz2k@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors say that this messaging might take away from efforts to increase vaccination, and some misinformation about these therapies is already circulating online.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7vu64dt00043b6mxgersl9d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many US doctors have never seen measles, given that the virus was declared eliminated in the country in 2000. There are no antiviral medications specifically to treat measles infection.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7te8xxb00053b5vo357lxum@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Vitamin A is not a substitute for vaccination,” said Dr. Megan Ranney, dean of the Yale School of Public Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7thyz9b00053b5v1vm67lj7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; recommends two doses for all children and adults who are diagnosed with measles. Guidance from the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt; also says vitamin A should be given to children with severe measles, such as those who are hospitalized, and specifies doses based on age.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7thz3ko00083b5vii44tep9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In an &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" target="_blank"&gt;opinion piece&lt;/a&gt; published Sunday on Fox News, Kennedy referenced &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/39/suppl_1/i48/699532?login=false" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; that show that vitamin A can “dramatically reduce measles mortality.” Speaking to Fox News on Tuesday, Kennedy described how CDC has been on the ground in West Texas and discussed the use of cod liver oil, which has high amounts of vitamins A and D.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ti7i2x000m3b5va4q9970a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, vitamin A is most useful for measles support in patients who have a specific deficiency. The studies mainly draw on evidence from low-income countries where that deficiency is common.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ti7cup000g3b5vosw1k2o2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s actually valid information,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, but it is “out of context.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7tj1zhk00073b6mtvyodkit@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Vitamin A supplementation can be lifesaving for measles cases when vitamin A deficiency is present,” he said. In these cases, it strengthens the immune system in providing a response against the virus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ti7g9l000j3b5vjinv2glh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But in the American context, the data for vitamin A use in measles is “weak,” said Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7uy581w00053b5v17xkvlpi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Vitamin A “really doesn’t have much of a role in the current discussion on the West Texas measles epidemic because it becomes a distraction about what we really need to focus on, which is vaccinating our kids,” he said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7uymdud00003b6mhhmvqj2g@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Beyond the updated CDC guidelines on vitamin A, there’s no set treatment regimen for measles because cases in the US have been generally rare. One of the medications that Kennedy mentioned, the antibiotic clarithromycin, could be an attempt to prevent secondary bacterial infections like pneumonia, but&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7055587/" target="_blank"&gt; evidence&lt;/a&gt; for that is limited. Budesonide is a steroid with a variety of uses, but it’s not clear how it might help someone with measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ur7zv300003b5v0uycyc5f@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s really important not to conflate what … [is] supportive or adjunctive care for measles versus curative treatment for measles,” said Dr. Christina Johns, a pediatric emergency physician at PM Pediatrics in Annapolis, Maryland. “There is no treatment for measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7us0a2f00083b5vw5kkp7p0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I believe that it is incredibly important to speak very clearly and directly with regard to therapy,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The American Academy of Pediatrics &lt;a href="https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/31490/AAP-leaders-combating-misinformation-amid-measles?autologincheck=redirected" target="_blank"&gt;released comments&lt;/a&gt; last week seeking to combat misinformation that says vitamin A can prevent measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “Vitamin A is only recommended in hospitalized patients, and it’s only recommended at specific doses,” said Dr. Leslie Motheral, a pediatrician in Lubbock, Texas, where the measles outbreak is growing. “I want to be very clear with that, because I do think there are patients who are not vaccinating and are just giving their kids high doses of vitamin A.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7te8xxb00073b5v9c57opsy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Motheral said she has started seeing misinformation about vitamin A on social media and wants to inform people that it cannot be used as measles prevention. Excess amounts of vitamin A can even be dangerous.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7te8xxb00083b5vg27w5n71@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “As pediatricians … we learn about vitamin A toxicity, but now we’ve got to really make sure we’re watching for those things in these patients,” she said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7te8xxb00093b5vkda798yq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;

            The measles outbreak in West Texas stands at 159 cases as of Tuesday, according to the Texas Department of Health Services. Many are in Gaines County, home to a high number of unvaccinated people, including a Mennonite community. One unvaccinated school-age child has died. Experts say the case count is probably far greater than what has been reported.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ur1eh700003b5vkfn0dfm9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some Texas residents have decided to get vaccinated, which experts attribute to access to good information.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7ur4e49000h3b5vrd0p8nv2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Those who are choosing vaccination are getting “vaccine questions answered by medical and public health professionals rather than purveyors of disinformation on social media,” Dr. Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock Public Health, and Dr. Phil Huang, director of health and human services in Dallas County, wrote in an &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2025/03/04/measles-outbreak-texas-mmr-vaccine/81146579007/" target="_blank"&gt;opinion &lt;/a&gt;piece in a USA Today.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7vu2pd100003b6mt1blrav1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy, who has a history of anti-vaccine activism, has said little about vaccination. He did not explicitly recommend the vaccine in his opinion piece on Fox News, calling the decision to vaccinate “a personal one,” and acknowledging it can contribute to “community immunity.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7vutpk1000c3b6miyeg9etx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In Kennedy’s interview on Tuesday, he said measles vaccination, “in highly unvaccinated communities like the Mennonites, it’s something we recommend, but we also understand there is a lot of mistrust of the vaccines.”

In agricultural communities, children can be even further exposed to multiple pesticides in water, air, dust, and in the home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Exposure to a 10% mixture increased brain cancer rates by 36%, leukemia rates by 23%, and overall pediatric cancer rates by 30% in Nebraska, the study found. The cancers are among the most common in the state, and may help explain their prevalence, said Jabeen Taiba, a lead author with the University of Nebraska Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“As individuals, we aren’t just exposed to one chemical, but a mixture, so if you are just studying one chemical alone, then you are not able to capture the exposures – it gives you limited information,” Taiba told the Guardian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The study investigated cancer data from 2,500 pediatric cases across 22 years in Nebraska, which is in the nation’s agricultural heartland. It holds the US’s second highest childhood cancer rates, in part due to widespread use of multiple pesticides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Of the 32 pesticides researchers examined, they found the most potent mixes were among herbicides such as &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/apr/24/epa-monsanto-toxic-herbicides-dicamba" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;dicamba&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/17/glyphosate-weedkiller-sperm" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;glyphosate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/feb/11/epa-reapprove-paraquat-herbicide-parkinsons" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;paraquat&lt;/a&gt; – controversial products that are each sprayed on tens of millions of acres of cropland nationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The pesticides have drawn intense scrutiny for their toxicity, and are prohibited in many other countries, but regulators here have resisted calls for bans. Pesticides are especially dangerous for children because they are smaller than adults and their bodies are still developing, so health risks can be considerable at a smaller exposure level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;The greatest risk is for farm workers and people living in agricultural communities, but children’s exposure in food presents an underestimated danger, Taiba said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;“We are exposed to multiple pesticides through water and food, so this is not just a problem for the agricultural communities,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Although the problem’s solution lies in changes in regulatory structure, which will take into account the toxicity of exposure to multiple substances, people can take steps to protect themselves. Taiba recommends buying organic foods when possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;Pesticide pollution of water sources in some communities is also common, and people could research levels in their water, then buy water filtration systems that are effective at removing the substances. Reverse osmosis and granular activated carbon systems are considered the best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-s3ycb2"&gt;In agricultural communities, adults who work around pesticides should leave their work clothes and shoes outdoors, Taiba said. Previous research has found pesticides tracked or brought into the home is a significant exposure source for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian US</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 12:02:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiiAFBVV95cUxQNDl3LVJLVUltMmk0WmxBb0IybnZvdlBFaWpkYXlaTm51MkIwWW5IeDJudUhNZHkzZUt6d0NzM0dCb0gyVzBrVkIwYkFXN2RQS1Q5MU5LaE03dEMxRlpTdzRVMWhfb2hrQVNSSF9JYzlkby1idmM3NU93TWhBRGlmWjNfbzlqaVVj</guid></item><item><title>The 7 Best Canned Foods for Cognitive Health, Recommended by Dietitians - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMickFVX3lxTE02OFFhVDFXamsxX1BFU2w1dFlDUEFVNUJpM290czQ4b3dBZ2JBazJXOUpBN180bEpNU1Rkb3hxbHFGN3FsaDR2Q0dVekFSMUgtX3lOb3hFYUlPNGVxSGNOd3RCMU1SWGFabVB3ZTZ4YndHQQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reviewed by Dietitian Maria Laura Haddad-Garcia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getty Images. EatingWell design. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to supporting brain health, the right foods can make all the difference—and you don’t even have to look beyond your pantry. While fresh ingredients often steal the spotlight, canned foods offer a convenient, budget-friendly way to nourish your mind with essential nutrients. From omega-3-rich fish to antioxidant-packed vegetables, the right choices can help support memory, focus and long-term cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Foods that contribute key nutrients to support cognitive health can absolutely come out of a can,” affirms &lt;a href="https://culinahealth.com/registered-dietitian/meredith-rofheart/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Meredith Rofheart, M.S., RDN;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Meredith Rofheart, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist. “The canning process helps preserve essential nutrients, making canned foods a convenient, long-lasting, and often more affordable source of brain-boosting micronutrients—such as omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins, vitamin K, fiber, and antioxidants.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you're stocking up for busy weeks or simply looking for easy ways to eat smarter, these seven dietitian-approved canned foods will fuel cognitive function and help keep your brain sharp and thriving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Canned Fish&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canned salmon, tuna, anchovies and mackerel are all high in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:omega-3 fatty acids;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, making them great sources of food for cognitive health. “Omega-3 fatty acids are components of brain cell membranes critical for cognitive functioning,” says Rofheart. “They’re anti-inflammatory and vital for maintaining normal brain processing.” Plus, research suggests positive effects on symptoms of depression and reducing risk of cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For canned fish, Rofheart says to choose options that are packed in water or extra virgin olive oil, and are labeled as wild-caught or safe-caught (meaning the fish is caught using sustainable fishing practices and has been tested for contaminants).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;2. Canned Tomatoes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/are-tomatoes-good-for-you-8636976" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Tomatoes;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Tomatoes&lt;/a&gt; are a top source of lycopene, a powerful antioxidant that helps protect brain cells from oxidative damage. “Lycopene has been associated with a lower risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's,” says Melinda “Mindi” Manuel, RD, a registered dietitian. “Interestingly, the heat from the canning process actually increases the bioavailability of lycopene, making canned tomatoes even more beneficial than fresh ones, in this regard.” However, more research is needed to confirm the neuroprotective effects of lycopene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manuel suggests blending canned tomatoes into homemade pasta sauce, chili, soups, stews or casseroles to maximize lycopene intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;3. Canned Mandarin Oranges&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Citrus contains unique antioxidants, including hesperidin and nobiletin, both of which have been shown to have neuroprotective effects on the brain,” says registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://mandyenright.com/meet-mandy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Mandy Enright, M.S., RDN, RYT;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Mandy Enright, M.S., RDN, RYT&lt;/a&gt;. “It may prevent against many cognitive disorders, including depression, dementia, Alzheimer's and memory loss.” While these nutrients are primarily found in the peels and white piths of citrus, consuming canned citrus like mandarin oranges can still be an adequate source of these key brain-protecting nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;4. Canned Spinach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leafy greens like spinach are great &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-rich-in-vitamin-k-8635254" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:sources of vitamin K;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;sources of vitamin K&lt;/a&gt;, folate, beta-carotene and lutein, which Rofheart says contribute to neuroprotective pathways, helping to support cognitive function and helping to slow decline. “They’re also anti-inflammatory, helping to reduce inflammation in the brain,” she says. Further, studies show that even one serving per day can positively affect brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When shopping for canned spinach, Rofheart recommends looking for cans that say “low sodium” or “no salt added” to help &lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7882895/easy-ways-to-cut-sodium-in-your-diet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:keep your sodium intake in check;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;keep your sodium intake in check&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;5. Canned Beans&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canned beans are a kitchen staple thanks to their affordability and high protein count. And &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291111/the-10-best-vegan-protein-sources/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:plant-based sources of protein;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;plant-based sources of protein&lt;/a&gt;, like beans, are associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rofheart points to another study showing that a higher dietary intake of B vitamins, abundant in beans and legumes, supports enhanced cognitive function. “These essential vitamins play a key role in homocysteine metabolism—an amino acid that, at elevated levels, can impair cognition and heart health,” she explains. “B vitamins help convert homocysteine into methionine, effectively reducing its levels and lowering the risk of adverse brain and heart health outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;6. Canned Pumpkin, Sweet Potatoes and Carrots&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do pumpkin, sweet potatoes and carrots all have in common? They are loaded with beta-carotene, a powerful antioxidant. “Beta-carotene helps protect brain cells from oxidative stress and inflammation, which are linked to cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases,” says Manuel. “These vegetables also provide essential vitamins and minerals that support overall brain function and health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, she says all three of these vegetables are high in fiber, which plays a crucial role in maintaining brain health through its impact on the gut-brain axis—the communication network that links the gut and the brain, which in turn, benefits your cognitive health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;7. Canned Peaches&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rofheart notes that canned peaches are packed with antioxidants, plus other brain-healthy nutrients like fiber and vitamins C and K. “The antioxidants in peaches help to lower oxidative stress and protect the central nervous system,” she says. “Preventing oxidative damage and maintaining a healthy central nervous system are key components in maintaining higher cognitive functioning.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When choosing canned peaches, Rofheart says to aim to limit added sugar by choosing fruit canned in water or their natural fruit juice, avoiding those canned in syrup or added juice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canned foods can be a powerhouse for brain health in a convenient, budget-friendly form. From lycopene-rich tomatoes to omega-3-packed canned fish, these pantry staples can help support memory, focus and cognitive function. Many foods, including leafy greens, citrus fruits and fiber-rich beans, further enhance brain health by reducing inflammation and supporting neuroprotective pathways. With smart choices like these, your pantry holds the key to maintaining cognitive wellness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read the original article on &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-canned-foods-for-cognitive-health-11690808" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:EATINGWELL;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;EATINGWELL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMickFVX3lxTE02OFFhVDFXamsxX1BFU2w1dFlDUEFVNUJpM290czQ4b3dBZ2JBazJXOUpBN180bEpNU1Rkb3hxbHFGN3FsaDR2Q0dVekFSMUgtX3lOb3hFYUlPNGVxSGNOd3RCMU1SWGFabVB3ZTZ4YndHQQ</guid></item><item><title>Diagnostic dilemma: Speed eating a 7-pound burger sent a man to ER unable to pass gas - Livescience.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxQYmJTd3F5Qlc2N0N4MEp1Y0NqLURQclBuVzZWSzJ6RURKQXJMOUJjUExnUGphRWJTS2xTSkUtclBJSk8wTTBMSGlHWkpEY2RJakNncmRQOUdmcXU4X1Q1N1JKU3BzV2lQTHVvZFRHMkhWYUNWT3IyT0NwUXlZbVU0Um5BalYxd1ItLU9oZzNEVWd0VHBuY0RSRkQ5b09QZ2lqNXp1U3JVYk5fQ3dWc2lXSWhnZDRKMlV3X1Vv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="article-body" class="text-copy bodyCopy auto"&gt;

The man's intestines had been pushed over to the left side of his abdomen, flattening his &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/the-pancreas" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/the-pancreas" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pancreas&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The diagnosis: &lt;/strong&gt;According to the patient, eight hours prior to visiting the emergency room, he had participated in a speed-eating competition. During the contest, he consumed a burger weighing 7 pounds (3.2 kilograms) in just 30 minutes. The man had vomited soon after, regurgitating undigested food but expelling no blood or bile. At the hospital, the doctors determined that the man's symptoms were caused by the sizable burger, which the patient had eaten too quickly for his &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.livescience.com/health/food-diet/how-long-does-it-take-to-digest-food" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.livescience.com/health/food-diet/how-long-does-it-take-to-digest-food"&gt;&lt;u&gt;stomach to digest&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The treatment: &lt;/strong&gt;Doctors admitted the patient to the general ward of the hospital. They attempted to relieve the pressure in his stomach through a tube inserted in his nose, which could have helped the excess gas in the digestive tract escape. However, his abdomen remained distended, and the pain continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-xZFLCnjCH3pQ3hmvPFnwtM" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-xZFLCnjCH3pQ3hmvPFnwtM slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Get the world’s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctors considered performing a &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002937.htm" target="_blank" data-url="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002937.htm" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;gastrostomy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — surgically opening the stomach through the abdominal wall — to remove the undigested food. However, the patient soon began passing gas, suggesting that his digestive system was starting to catch up and process the huge mass of chewed-up burger. Blood analysis showed that the man's white blood cell count was starting to return to normal. Finally, the patient had a bowel movement. Five days later, his symptoms had fully abated, and he was discharged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the case unique: &lt;/strong&gt;When fully expanded, the average adult's stomach can comfortably hold &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279304/" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279304/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;u&gt;up to 50 ounces (1.5 liters)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, though this varies between individuals. People who regularly compete in eating contests "train" their stomachs to contain more than this average by repeatedly and rapidly stretching the stomach walls "during their gobbling episodes," the doctors wrote in their report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But frequently cramming their stomachs with enormous quantities of food carries serious health risks, the physicians warned. These risks may include injury to the stomach wall or weakening of muscles that move food into the lower intestine; pneumonia from inhaling food particles into the lungs; and in the long term, obesity, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-freeText-xZFLCnjCH3pQ3hmvPFnwtM-3nXEat6UTOTb0LxTWxfuxjbbfkQgSSSq" class="slice-container freeText-wrapper freeText-xZFLCnjCH3pQ3hmvPFnwtM-3nXEat6UTOTb0LxTWxfuxjbbfkQgSSSq slice-container-freeText"&gt;&lt;div class="info-block"&gt;&lt;p class="infoDisclaimer"&gt;This article is for informational purposes only and is not meant to offer medical advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

"We thought it'd be really fun to see no-one around," he says. It wasn't. Places the pair knew well, like Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square, perennially abuzz with people, were chillingly quiet.

"We even have a dog-friendly cinema." As countries around the world, including Sweden's neighbours Norway, Finland and Denmark, ushered in national lockdowns in March 2020, Mc Manus was aware that her own government had &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52076293" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;decided to buck the trend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She heard how dog owners in some nations couldn't even take their pets out for walks because of lockdown rules. South Africa &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-52047374" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;was one such country&lt;/a&gt;. This struck Mc Manus as terrible. At the time, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://citydogexpert.com/the-covid-chronicles-dogenburg/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;she wrote a blog post&lt;/a&gt; in which she said, "I am convinced that my government is acting in a secure and correct way". However, she also expressed concern that her fellow Swedes were not always following the official &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7537539/" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;public health guidelines around social distancing&lt;/a&gt;, such as limiting the number of people who could meet together in a group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mc Manus remembers taking frequent walks in beauty spots, but also that she and her colleagues continually wore masks &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200504-coronavirus-what-is-the-best-kind-of-face-mask" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;to help prevent Covid-19 transmission&lt;/a&gt; at the veterinary hospital where she worked in 2020. Plus, she and her partner avoided restaurants and meeting up with lots of other people. Even now, Mc Manus says she is not sure what to make of Sweden's official strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I want to base it on facts – like how many people died," she says.

But while excess mortality fell in the three other countries in 2020, it rose compared to Sweden in 2021 and 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The four countries have a comparable number of excess deaths when you account for the fact that population sizes differ," says Forthun. What lockdowns did affect, in part, was the timing of when spikes in excess deaths occurred. Of Norway's approach, Forthun adds: "We probably kept some older and vulnerable people alive for a longer period." Whereas authorities in Sweden &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55347021" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;were criticised in 2020&lt;/a&gt; over high numbers of deaths at care homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Some economists have combined similar data with comparisons of economic performance indicators between the same four Nordic countries to argue that, overall, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecaf.12611" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Sweden's approach was justified&lt;/a&gt; due to the relatively low economic costs. But such arguments are controversial and the lack of a lockdown in Sweden remains an area for heated debate among some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;One Swedish epidemiologist, Nele Brusselaers, of the Karolinska Institute, has criticised her country's Covid-19 strategy. She moved to Belgium during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I'm a medical doctor so of course I care about lives," she says. "We want to save every single life." She says many of her fellow Swedes are "still in denial" about Covid-19 though some have come to question the lack of lockdown in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Brusselaers, who lived in Sweden in 2020, notes how her posts about Covid-19 on social media resulted in fierce pushback from some who disagreed with her stance on lockdown as an appropriate strategy. "You get so much hatred," she says. "That's not something I was used to."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kw2b7k.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images Sweden's approach to controlling the virus contrasted dramatically with that of its neighbours in the early stages of the pandemic (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;Sweden's approach to controlling the virus contrasted dramatically with that of its neighbours in the early stages of the pandemic (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Even today, some people find it hard to move past the hostility they faced on the topic of lockdowns. One university researcher approached by the BBC for this article said they were so traumatised by the abuse they received online in 2020 that they never intended to comment on Covid-19 control measures, or lockdowns, publicly again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Furthermore, some people who lived in countries without lockdowns, and who disagreed with their government's approach, are still reeling from the experience. Tanzania never had any Covid-19 lockdowns. The country's former &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-56412912" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;President, John Magufuli&lt;/a&gt;, who dismissed lockdowns and other public health interventions, died &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-56437852" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Magufuli's approach to the pandemic was "unscientific", says history lecturer Fadhili Mtani at the Muslim University of Morogoro in Tanzania. "He advocated for &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-52519853" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;traditional herbs&lt;/a&gt; and later he &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-55900680" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;rejected vaccines&lt;/a&gt;."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But Mtani recalls visiting hospitals where members of his own family had passed away of an illness. "I saw people suffocating in the hospitals," he says. "The hospital said we should not say it's Covid." Official figures suggest &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/tanzania" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;around 840 people have died of Covid-19 in Tanzania&lt;/a&gt; since the start of the pandemic. Mtani says that the government has not made accurate statistics available, however. An international collaboration aimed at &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02796-3/fulltext" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;estimating the global excess deaths&lt;/a&gt; during the first two years of the pandemic has put the total number of deaths in Tanzania at somewhere between 102,000-188,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Mtani argues that Tanzania should have enforced a lockdown, though without placing excessive restrictions on the movement of workers. "The majority of people are poor. To deny movement for them is to deny their existence," Mtani explains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Many scientists emphasise that lockdowns were crucial for saving lives in the early part of the pandemic, before vaccines were available, and also for limiting the pressure on health services. By March 2020, this pressure was already severe in the UK, says Adam Kucharski, professor of infectious disease epidemiology, at the London School of Hygiene &amp;amp; Tropical Medicine. "The NHS was overwhelmed," Kucharski explains, referring to the &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2024/sep/26/doctor-in-tears-at-covid-inquiry-says-what-nhs-staff-saw-was-indescribable" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;emotional testimony of doctors&lt;/a&gt; who have spoken to the UK's public inquiry into the government’s Covid-19 response. "It's ridiculous to suggest [the NHS] wasn't under effectively breaking pressure by that point," adds Kucharski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Kucharski also says that, because of the UK's global connections and the large number of young people who live together &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/more-young-people-in-the-uk-are-living-with-parents-and-grandparents-heres-what-you-need-to-know-if-youre-considering-it-216280" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;or with their parents&lt;/a&gt; compared &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190821-why-so-many-young-swedes-live-alone" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;to Sweden&lt;/a&gt;, for example, it might have been much harder for the UK to control Covid-19 transmission without imposing a lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He also points to &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abd9338" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;a 2021 study&lt;/a&gt; that attempted to quantify the effect of specific government interventions on the spread of Covid-19, using data from 41 countries. It reveals that certain aspects of national lockdowns might have been more impactful than others. The researchers found, for example, that banning gatherings of more than 10 people or closing schools and universities was especially effective, reducing transmission by more than 35% on average. Shutting restaurants and bars seemed to make slightly less difference to transmission, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;What's more, the researchers suggest that adding a strict stay-at-home order on top of such measures "only had a small additional effect" in terms of slowing down Covid-19 – estimated at below 17.5% on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/160xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp 160w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/240xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/320xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/640xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/800xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp 1376w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1920xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp 1920w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p0kw2b8l.jpg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="Getty Images The effects of Tanzania's early response to Covid-19 is still not visible in the official government statistics (Credit: Getty Images)" class="sc-a34861b-0 efFcac"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-a34861b-2 hesJxn"&gt;Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="caption-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 bdPeAJ"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="sc-8353772e-0 iUqqeb"&gt;The effects of Tanzania's early response to Covid-19 is still not visible in the official government statistics (Credit: Getty Images)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Countries that chose not to lock down severely may also have had more time to prepare for the arrival of Covid-19, or social and structural reasons as to why the Sars-CoV-2 virus was less likely to spread quickly there versus other nations. Even then, there are surprising comparisons to be made. Take Iceland and New Zealand, for instance. Both are wealthy island nations with relatively small populations but while New Zealand introduced &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://nzhistory.govt.nz/page/new-zealand-enters-nationwide-lockdown-fight-against-covid-19" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;a strict lockdown on 25 March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, Iceland never did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"They [Iceland] had more of a mitigation strategy," says Leah Grout, a research data analyst specialising in public health at the Southern California University of Health Sciences. Grout was &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/14034948221149143" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;lead author on a research paper&lt;/a&gt; about the contrasting Covid-19 strategies and outcomes of these two countries. Iceland introduced &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.stjornarradid.is/efst-a-baugi/frettir/stok-frett/?NewsId=c65cf658-6eb6-11ea-9462-005056bc4d74" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;a test and trace programme&lt;/a&gt;, in which infections and contacts between people were monitored so that individuals – rather than entire populations – were asked to observe quarantine for a time. This measure was also used in many countries that also applied lockdowns, when those lockdowns were lifted. Iceland had some restrictions on social gatherings and it did &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-56412790" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;close its borders to some travellers&lt;/a&gt;, briefly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"New Zealand had one of the lowest mortality rates globally with their approach," says Grout. "Iceland also fared pretty well." Plus, the economic impacts on both countries were limited, she adds. Other researchers have made similar findings &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1757780223002305" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;regarding New Zealand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/15/8470" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Iceland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Much was written in 2020 about various countries' efforts to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. But, in retrospect, that seems much too early to come to any real conclusions. &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://theconversation.com/uruguay-quietly-beats-coronavirus-distinguishing-itself-from-its-south-american-neighbors-yet-again-140037" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;Uruguay was lauded at the time&lt;/a&gt; for apparently managing to keep Covid-19 at bay, despite never enacting a strict lockdown. The country's government enforced some forms of social distancing, including the closure of some gyms, and Uruguay's borders were also &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cesam.org/documents/CESAM-COVID19-OVERVIEW-WEEK_2021_04.pdf" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;closed to certain travellers&lt;/a&gt;, for instance.

Excess deaths in 2021, for example, were nearly 19% above the expected figure, based on historical trends. The study's authors put this down mostly to the spread of Covid-19 but add that impacts from the pandemic on the ability to provide healthcare in other ways probably also played a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Similarly, Japan was able to keep mortality from Covid-19 to a relatively low level in the early part of the pandemic. By the summer of 2022, Covid-19 &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://jogh.org/2022/jogh-12-03073" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;deaths had reached 36,200&lt;/a&gt;. Today, they stand &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/15587088" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;at 130,000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Some researchers argue that Japan’s approach proved to be the right one overall. "Even without lockdown, suppression of epidemic curves has been largely successful," argues Hiroshi Nishiura, a professor in the graduate school of medicine at Kyoto University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Despite this, Yasuharu Tokuda, a clinical epidemiologist and director of the Muribushi Okinawa Center for Teaching Hospitals in Okinawa, Japan, argues that a tougher approach might have been beneficial. "Some patients could not be admitted to the hospital because of the lack of available beds," he says. "If we have a strong viral pandemic, then we need to have a stricter lockdown in Japan." Research suggests that &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-024-18866-3" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;there might be resistance to such an idea&lt;/a&gt; among members of the public in Japan, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="quote-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-9967660-0 WkJHg"&gt;&lt;span class="sc-9967660-2 kcfPbO"&gt;I became quite introverted and now I find I don't want to interact with people as much as I did before – Bill Allison&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;It is important to reflect on just how drastic a measure lockdown really is. Kucharski, for one, calls it a "blunt" tool. "We should never have got to that point where we were in so much trouble, with so little visibility of what the pandemic was doing," he says. It was due to a lack of certainty over what would happen next, and a dearth of other interventions on the table, that the UK was more or less forced into lockdown, he suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Many have still not got over the effects of lockdown. In March 2020, Bill Allison, a former civil servant in Scotland, was in his mid-60s. He had many plans for his retirement – he wanted to see the world. Back then, Allison was also an avid pub-goer who frequently met up with his friends for a pint. Lockdown stopped him in his tracks. He says he followed the rules at all times but this left him feeling a profound sense of loneliness and isolation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I gathered up all the scraps of wood that I had and decided to see if I could make them into an electric guitar," he says. "I would work late at night. There was nothing else to do, really." He found a guitar-making group online, through which he met people with similar interests. "I made quite a lot of new friends."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;But when the world gradually began to open up again, Allison was struck by a strong sense of what he had been missing and was hard to regain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The pub near me, it's nothing like as busy as it was before Covid," he says. "I became quite introverted and now I find I don't want to interact with people as much as I did before. I was discussing it with a few of my friends.

Initially, in the &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-57135647" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;first half of 2021&lt;/a&gt; and then again in 2022, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/10105395231203117" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;cases surged&lt;/a&gt; as some &lt;a target="_self" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-57153195" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;preventative measures in the country&lt;/a&gt;, and the population itself, &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov.tw/En/EpidemicTheme/Detail/hQ4XhaZAzUmNe2ksY4tjMA?archiveId=5-djCfC9g9X4njJrs8rM3A" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;started to relax&lt;/a&gt;.

Ultimately, the vast majority of nations did enact lockdowns at some point during 2020 or 2021 and it would be hard to suggest that they are all significantly worse off because of that intervention, specifically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Still, five years later, the harshness of lockdowns and their effects on millions if not billions of people has become clearer. Even some researchers who have found evidence that lockdowns saved lives have &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0261759" class="sc-c9299ecf-0 beIoQm"&gt;cautioned against turning to this measure in haste&lt;/a&gt; in the future.

"It needs to be super clear."

&lt;p&gt;Researchers from China, Japan, and the US have 3D-printed a full penile system using a hydrogel-based model. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The bioengineered component designed to imitate a portion of the penis was implanted into rabbits and pigs diagnosed with penile deformities, and the outcomes were remarkable. The penile implants enabled the rabbits and pigs to mate and reproduce biologically within weeks after the surgery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-overcoming-the-challenges-of-vascularization"&gt;Overcoming the challenges of vascularization&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most complex organs in the human body require an intricate vascular system for the tissue to function. In the penis, this network plays a crucial role in achieving an erection, as blood must flow into the corpora cavernosa and remain trapped to maintain rigidity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team devised a hydrogel-based model that consists of the corpora cavernosa, corpus spongiosum, and the tunica albuginea sheath. It enabled the monitoring of integral aspects of the genital organ, its vasculature, and any potential defects without the necessity of actual human or animal trials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The team specifically aimed to develop a model to study erectile dysfunction and Peyronie’s disease, a condition where scar tissue causes painful and curved erections. By replicating how blood engorges the corpora cavernosa and how cavernous sinuses function as valves to maintain an erection, the model provided valuable insights into the mechanisms behind these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-successful-prosthesis-implantation-and-further-expectations"&gt;Successful prosthesis implantation and further expectations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To test its efficacy, the researchers designed a more advanced version of the model that was implanted with endothelial cells, the cells that line the &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/culture/james-harrison-australian-blood-donor-dies" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;blood &lt;/a&gt;vessels. The engineered tissue was implanted into rabbits and pigs with penile vascular malformations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After a few weeks, the animals showed restoration of erectile function and were subsequently observed copulating and reproducing. This marked an important advance in the field of regenerative medicine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“These findings underscore the potential clinical applications of biomimetic corpus cavernosum (BCC) for the treatment of penile injuries. Furthermore, this study advances the clinical application of &lt;a href="https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/3d-printing-of-bendable-concrete" target="_blank" rel="dofollow"&gt;3D-printed&lt;/a&gt; artificial tissue organs,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Printing biological tissues seems to be the latest technological advancement in tissue engineering. Based on the progress made in bioprinting, Eindhoven University of Technology has &lt;a href="https://www.tue.nl/en/news-and-events/news-overview/27-02-2025-3d-printing-living-tissue-with-light-takes-a-leap-forward" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;pioneered&lt;/a&gt; the use of a light-based 3D printing technique called xolography for living cell structures. This advancement may help in the manufacturing of complex biological tissues like muscles and kidneys, which may bring regenerative medicine closer to reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="body-content true    body-medium-medium  t-text-text-secondary"&gt;&lt;div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Xolography is based on the principle of employing two or more intersecting light beams to solidify a liquid polymer. The Eindhoven team has advanced this technique to print structures up to 20 microns in size which is the approximate size of a human cell. In combination with other techniques, this can lead to further advances in tissue engineering. However, this tech is currently still in the prototype phase. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The study has been published in &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-025-01367-y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Biomedical Engineering&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

They are present everywhere, including the human brain. A recent paper in Nature Medicine found that the human brain contains approximately a spoon's worth of microplastics and nanoplastics (MNPs); brain tissues were found to have 7–30 times higher amounts of MNPs than other organs such as the liver or kidney. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A commentary report published in the Brain Medicine journal has shed light on the growing menace of microplastics, the health consequences that are likely to show up and the measures that can be taken for remedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The current evidence base (largely based upon animal and cell culture studies) suggests that MNP exposure can lead to adverse health impacts via oxidative stress, inflammation, immune dysfunction, altered biochemical/energy metabolism, impaired cell proliferation, abnormal organ development, disrupted metabolic pathways, and carcinogenicity," the researchers have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Particularly, a recent study in The New England Journal of Medicine found that people with a carotid artery plaque in which MNPs were detected had a higher risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or all-cause mortality (5). Additionally, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients' stool contained about 1.5 times more microplastics than healthy controls, averaging 41.8 vs. 28.0 particles per gram of dry stool," they have said in the report highlighting a study on mice where mice exposed to nanoplastics for 8 weeks led to learning and memory deficits, lower levels of synaptic proteins, and neuroinflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scientists have urged to "reduce the most significant sources of microplastic intake."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Switching from bottled water to tap water could reduce microplastic intake from 90,000 to 4,000 particles per year, making it an impactful intervention," they have suggested. "Stopping the practice of heating food in plastic could be one of the most effective ways to reduce microplastic consumption."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Limiting canned food consumption and opting for non-plastic or BPA-free packaged alternatives can effectively reduce exposure," the researchers have said and have added, "Highly processed foods, like chicken nuggets, contained 30 times more microplastics per gram than chicken breasts, highlighting the impact of industrial processing, which often uses plastics at some point."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="18"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to reduce microplastics in daily life&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Avoid using bottled water&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use a high-quality water filter (such as one with activated carbon or reverse osmosis) at home. Opt for glass, stainless steel, or BPA-free reusable bottles instead of plastic bottles. Drink tap water if it is deemed safe in your area, as it often contains fewer microplastics than bottled water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="em strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Eat fresh and unprocessed foods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choose fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole foods over processed and packaged items.

Then there are the horror stories about thyroid &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/cancer/index.html" id="mol-f4b91e80-f94f-11ef-9561-93fcab9b5784"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt;, pancreatitis, stomach paralysis and blindness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Now experts and patients fear they have uncovered a new risk: deafness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Slimmers on the drug are reporting severe problems including painful ringing sounds, disorientating muffled noises and, in the most extreme cases, full blown hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Some doctors believe they may have worked out what is behind these alarming symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Speaking to the Daily Mail, New Jersey-based audiology consultant Dr Robert DiSogra says the issues being reported could be the result of a loss of fat in the ear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Sudden and rapid weight-loss can cause the fatty tissue surrounding the Eustachian tubes, that connect your ears to the back of your throat, to shrink.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Ozempic patients are complaining of hearing issues after taking the medication&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can cause the tubes to stay open when they should be shut, and ultimately result in the hearing issues being reported by those on Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Tony Floyd, who is based in New South Wales, Australia, says he had one patient whose Eustachian tubes stayed open all the time after they lost a substantial amount of weight using Ozempic. He says their symptoms included the 'sensation of pressure and muffled hearing in one ear'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston explain that when hearing tubes stay open due to a loss of fat, 'it allows sounds to be transmitted directly to the middle ear.' This condition is known as patulous or patent eustachian tube dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with ringing sounds and muffled hearing, they warn that patients could also experience autophony - which is when you hear self-generated sounds such as your breathing, voice or heartbeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They advise: ‘Treatment includes avoiding triggers such as caffeine consumption (or a decreasing the amount), rehydration during vigorous exercise, or changing hormonal therapy. If medical treatment fails or symptoms recur, surgery to correct or modify the opening of the eustachian tube might be necessary.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ozempic was originally developed to treat type 2 diabetes, by lowering blood sugar levels. Diabetes can be genetic – known as type 1 diabetes, but around three quarters of the 38.4 million cases in the US are type 2 and caused by poor diet and lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After studies revealed the drug - which falls into the category of glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist (GLP-1s) injections - was a highly effective appetite-suppressant, the weekly injections were repurposed to treat weight-loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In 2018, 92 percent of new Ozempic users had been diagnosed with diabetes. By 2021, this had fallen to 77 percent and continues to decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Research suggests patients taking Ozempic - which contains an active ingredient called semaglutide – can lose up to 15 per cent of their body weight within a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Those taking another GLP-1 drug, called Mounjaro, lose as much as a fifth of their body weight over the same time period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="mol-img-group floatRHS"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;New Jersey-based audiology consultant Dr Robert DiSogra said the issues being reported could be the result of a loss of fat in the ear&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, there are risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Around a fifth of people who take weight-loss injections suffer from nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. For most, these issues fade after several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of greater concern are reports of pancreatitis. This causes inflammation of the pancreas, an organ in the abdomen which produces digestive hormones. In some cases, pancreatitis can be life-threatening and trigger organ failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, a study carried out by researchers at Harvard University last year concluded that taking Ozempic doubles the risk of a rare condition called non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, or NAION.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This medical emergency occurs when blood flow to the nerves of the eye becomes blocked, causing vision loss. But despite the increased risk, the condition is still thought to only occur in one in every 4,000 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There are not yet any official warnings about hearing problems associated with Ozempic. But patients in online support groups are increasingly raising the alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Some experts said there is no solid evidence to support Ozempic-induced tinnitus or hearing loss and claim the incidents are very rare&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One Facebook user, Anna Helms, revealed that after taking an Ozempic shot, her tinnitus would 'flare up bad for a few days', while dozens of others say they developed the condition for the first after taking the weight loss drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Ken Myers, from Pennsylvania, said he experienced a 'loud ringing' in his ears, along with many other side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Dahlia Presley wrote in a Facebook group: 'First time today and immediately after I had my Ozempic shot I started feeling a terrible migraine for the past four hours and it's getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'My head is throbbing and I hear a loud ringing in my ears!! Someone please help... Is this a bad side effect? My head feels like it's gonna explode.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On Reddit, there are similar complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Redditor Lindainthemountains wrote: 'I have been taking Ozempic for one month and have lost 7lbs. I love finally having control over my eating after over 30 years of trying every diet ever invented! I had the usual gastrointestinal issues the first two weeks, but those passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But I still have ringing in my ears and a weird taste in my mouth immediately after an injection.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a bid to stop the ringing in her ears, the Redditor said she cut her Ozempic doses in half and that seemed to help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;One Redditor said that along with 'pretty bad' tinnitus, they were also hit by 'very mild hearing loss' after using Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Angie Dugdale, a singer based in Utah, says she experienced the sensation of pressure and muffled hearing in one ear after taking Ozempic for diabetes. She says the issue is now so severe, she can no longer sing.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite the complaints, some experts claim there is no solid evidence to support Ozempic-induced tinnitus or hearing loss and stressed that incidents are very rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They also highlighted that diabetes itself can cause nerve damage in the ears, which can lead to hearing loss and therefore could be behind the reported problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Leonard A. Jason, a professor at DePaul University, Chicago, says he has 'not seen any evidence in reputable outlets that would support this as a side effect of the medication'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dietician Carolyn Williams adds: 'I've seen this claim made over the past few months and noticed that it seemed to pop back up recently. An increased risk of hearing loss is associated with numerous medications, but, to date, I have not seen evidence that hearing loss is a side effect of taking semaglutide drugs like Ozempic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'For most people, the health benefits that semaglutide drugs provide significantly outweigh the risks based on current research.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Healthy Hearing, the largest hearing-focused consumer website, said Ozempic and other anti-obesity GLP-1 agonists like Mounjaro and Zepbound 'do not appear to cause hearing problems, although there have been sporadic case reports of problems discussed on internet forums like Reddit'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The Daily Mail has contacted Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic, for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Mar 2025 07:14:54 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipAFBVV95cUxNcHFnN3RTWE5FQnZRT0FvNDg4dFRubnlQb0V1aXRnR1ZXQW9GbWRrdTVqSUo0b0VydU9GWk81bzR2R3N2YVNCYjlrdkFLNXpzTUNITjRpc2tWZmtQMkNDSmc1LTI3NHJFblAxTkFoNDRjRnZQX3JnaW9RdTNjdUpuOGt2MGdKN194cEI2SElfbkg3UFFRNWJ2SGxiVTR6YXNVZEJxdg</guid></item><item><title>A family tree BRCA gene revelation may have saved my life - BBC.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWkFVX3lxTE9sV29rNUdLZmk4enJXXzZJR1hMeVJDTU5pQ0h6cXd6Tk55WlNucGN5R2VrRkU0OG1pNS12TVljOS1JSjlmSHkwWDBtOG1Eb2VhR2VuVHRkbUFYQdIBX0FVX3lxTE1UUlNEZmxwYmN6YlFkYWFqZjdkY0lBY19XdzRiRVZ6SjFZQmhqY01EZExDZ01KTFYyMkkxcWQ5d1IwaGZXNlFqZHZaYU15a3haRk9NM1VVODgzMDZxbHdv?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;article&gt;&lt;p data-component="headline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h1 class="sc-518485e5-0 itISwu"&gt;A family tree gene revelation may have saved my life&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="byline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new" class="sc-b42e7a8f-0 haItSe"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="byline-new-contributors" class="sc-b42e7a8f-12 fcCDwR"&gt;&lt;div class="sc-b42e7a8f-5 evAEAB"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="sc-b42e7a8f-7 kItaYD"&gt;Elise McGinley&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="sc-b42e7a8f-8 bTSIhT"&gt;&lt;span&gt;BBC Scotland News&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 ejjhCR"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="hero-image" class="sc-a34861b-1 jxzoZC"&gt;&lt;img src="/bbcx/grey-placeholder.png" class="sc-a34861b-0 cOpVbP hide-when-no-script"&gt;&lt;img sizes="(min-width: 1280px) 50vw, (min-width: 1008px) 66vw, 96vw" srcset="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/240/cpsprodpb/6ab1/live/0b9aaec0-f919-11ef-becb-07cbf84d799c.jpg.webp 240w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/6ab1/live/0b9aaec0-f919-11ef-becb-07cbf84d799c.jpg.webp 320w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6ab1/live/0b9aaec0-f919-11ef-becb-07cbf84d799c.jpg.webp 480w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/6ab1/live/0b9aaec0-f919-11ef-becb-07cbf84d799c.jpg.webp 640w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/6ab1/live/0b9aaec0-f919-11ef-becb-07cbf84d799c.jpg.webp 800w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/6ab1/live/0b9aaec0-f919-11ef-becb-07cbf84d799c.jpg.webp 1024w,https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/6ab1/live/0b9aaec0-f919-11ef-becb-07cbf84d799c.jpg.webp 1536w" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6ab1/live/0b9aaec0-f919-11ef-becb-07cbf84d799c.jpg.webp" loading="eager" alt="Hannah Howie Hannah Howie, who has long, blonde hair and is wearing a red dress with white spots, strikes  a pose against a clear blue sky.

how he stumbled upon the discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He said: "We were trying to pull together a family tree for Hannah's dad for his birthday and we found there was a line of female relatives on her dad's side who had died of breast cancer at a young age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"We clocked it with her gran, Agnes, who died at 33. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Then we started noticing a pattern."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;He said the enormity of his discovery had yet to hit home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Luke said: "Looking back, it's so strange how all of this has come from that one gift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"I'm so glad we found out this way and that Hannah knows about it and can act on decreasing the risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The fact she has been able to pre-empt all of this is incredible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 eeiVGB"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-518485e5-0 DkKTF"&gt;'I had to know'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 dlWCEZ"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Prof Zosia Miedzybrodska, of the University of Aberdeen, decsribed BRCA 2 as a "huge gene" and said it could mutate and go wrong "in many ways".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;And she said the percentage difference between male and female cancers was "quite significant".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The risk increase for a woman with breast cancer is anywhere up to 85%," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"For prostate cancer it's 27% and for male breast cancer it's 10%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"The only way you know if you have the faulty BRCA 2 gene is if there is a history of breast, prostate or ovarian cancer in the family."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;Cruise ship entertainer Hannah booked an appointment to discover if she had the gene, which also dramatically increases the risk of ovarian cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;She told BBC Scotland News: "I had to find out if I had the faulty BRCA 2 gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-eb7bd5f6-0 fezwLZ"&gt;"Some people don't want to know but for my sanity, I really had to know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;div data-component="image-block" class="sc-18fde0d6-0 jFCfG"&gt;&lt;div data-testid="image"

That could lead to shortages once the flu starts circulating this fall.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Similarly, the CDC’s advisory committee meeting is a necessary step to issuing a federal recommendation that people get the flu shot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;“It’s that recommendation that allows people to use their medical insurance to get the flu vaccine,” Pekosz said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;That means if federal officials sit on their hands, next season the flu shot will be a lot more expensive, if you can find it at all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;This isn’t the only area of concern about Kennedy’s leadership of federal health policy. The outbreak of measles in Texas and other states has alarmed American health care experts and has even caused Mexico to issue a travel advisory warning against travel to those parts of the United States.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Kennedy &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/02/health/measles-rfk-vaccines/index.html" target="_blank" rel="" title="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/02/health/measles-rfk-vaccines/index.html"&gt;backed off somewhat&lt;/a&gt; from his usual vaccine skepticism after a Texas child died of measles, the first fatal case of the virus in the United States in more than a decade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;a Fox News op-ed&lt;/a&gt;, Kennedy acknowledged that “vaccines not only protect individual children from measles, but also contribute to community immunity, protecting those who are unable to be vaccinated due to medical reasons.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;But he still stopped short of saying what science had shown for generations: Immunizations are the best way to prevent deadly viral illnesses like measles. Vaccines are the reason some viral diseases like smallpox have been eradicated. Vaccines are why polio was a thing of the past — &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9577438/" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;until it wasn’t&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;Framing vaccines, as Kennedy does, as purely a personal choice not only disregards science but also places communities at risk. Yes, some people may have valid reasons for not vaccinating, be it preexisting medical conditions or religious beliefs. But exemptions in those cases have always been and remain available. Kennedy, who has pushed dangerous theories like vitamin A for treating measles, is advocating that we walk away from keeping Americans safe. Making preventable diseases deadly again must be part of MAGA’s mantra. But it doesn’t have to be yours. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt;According &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/index.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;to the CDC’s website&lt;/a&gt;, the immunization advisory committee meeting was “postponed to accommodate public comment in advance of the meeting.” Give the agency its wish — &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/other/public-comments.html" target="_blank" rel=""&gt;let it know&lt;/a&gt; you want to protect yourselves, your family, and your community by keeping the flu shot and other crucial vaccines available and affordable. By autumn, it may be too late.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="paragraph | gutter_20_0"&gt;&lt;span class="html-render"&gt; (The CDC phone number is 800-232-4636 and the docket number for the meeting is CDC-2025-0003.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="tagline_hr | border_foreground border_half gutter_20_28--mobile

While fresh ingredients often steal the spotlight, canned foods offer a convenient, budget-friendly way to nourish your mind with essential nutrients. From omega-3-rich fish to antioxidant-packed vegetables, the right choices can help support memory, focus and long-term cognitive function.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Foods that contribute key nutrients to support cognitive health can absolutely come out of a can,” affirms &lt;a href="https://culinahealth.com/registered-dietitian/meredith-rofheart/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Meredith Rofheart, M.S., RDN&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian nutritionist. “The canning process helps preserve essential nutrients, making canned foods a convenient, long-lasting, and often more affordable source of brain-boosting micronutrients—such as omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins, vitamin K, fiber, and antioxidants.” 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Whether you're stocking up for busy weeks or simply looking for easy ways to eat smarter, these seven dietitian-approved canned foods will fuel cognitive function and help keep your brain sharp and thriving.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-1-canned-fish"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 1. Canned Fish &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned salmon, tuna, anchovies and mackerel are all high in &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/8035578/omega-3-supplements-benefits/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;omega-3 fatty acids&lt;/a&gt;, making them great sources of food for cognitive health. “Omega-3 fatty acids are components of brain cell membranes critical for cognitive functioning,” says Rofheart. “They’re anti-inflammatory and vital for maintaining normal brain processing.” Plus, research suggests positive effects on symptoms of depression and reducing risk of cognitive decline.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; For canned fish, Rofheart says to choose options that are packed in water or extra virgin olive oil, and are labeled as wild-caught or safe-caught (meaning the fish is caught using sustainable fishing practices and has been tested for contaminants). 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/are-tomatoes-good-for-you-8636976" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Tomatoes&lt;/a&gt; are a top source of lycopene, a powerful antioxidant that helps protect brain cells from oxidative damage.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Lycopene has been associated with a lower risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's,” says Melinda “Mindi” Manuel, RD, a registered dietitian.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Interestingly, the heat from the canning process actually increases the bioavailability of lycopene, making canned tomatoes even more beneficial than fresh ones, in this regard.” However, more research is needed to confirm the neuroprotective effects of lycopene.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Manuel suggests blending canned tomatoes into homemade pasta sauce, chili, soups, stews or casseroles to maximize lycopene intake. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “Citrus contains unique antioxidants, including hesperidin and nobiletin, both of which have been shown to have neuroprotective effects on the brain,” says registered dietitian &lt;a href="https://mandyenright.com/meet-mandy/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Mandy Enright, M.S., RDN, RYT&lt;/a&gt;. “It may prevent against many cognitive disorders, including depression, dementia, Alzheimer's and memory loss.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; While these nutrients are primarily found in the peels and white piths of citrus, consuming canned citrus like mandarin oranges can still be an adequate source of these key brain-protecting nutrients.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-4-canned-spinach"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 4. Canned Spinach &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Leafy greens like spinach are great &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/foods-rich-in-vitamin-k-8635254" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;sources of vitamin K&lt;/a&gt;, folate, beta-carotene and lutein, which Rofheart says contribute to neuroprotective pathways, helping to support cognitive function and helping to slow decline. “They’re also anti-inflammatory, helping to reduce inflammation in the brain,” she says. Further, studies show that even one serving per day can positively affect brain health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When shopping for canned spinach, Rofheart recommends looking for cans that say “low sodium” or “no salt added” to help &lt;a class="recommendation-inline-link" href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7882895/easy-ways-to-cut-sodium-in-your-diet/" link-destination-recommendation="true" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;keep your sodium intake in check&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-5-canned-beans"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 5. Canned Beans &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned beans are a kitchen staple thanks to their affordability and high protein count. And &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291111/the-10-best-vegan-protein-sources/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based sources of protein&lt;/a&gt;, like beans, are associated with a lower risk of cognitive decline.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Rofheart points to another study showing that a higher dietary intake of B vitamins, abundant in beans and legumes, supports enhanced cognitive function. “These essential vitamins play a key role in homocysteine metabolism—an amino acid that, at elevated levels, can impair cognition and heart health,” she explains. “B vitamins help convert homocysteine into methionine, effectively reducing its levels and lowering the risk of adverse brain and heart health outcomes.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-6-canned-pumpkin-sweet-potatoes-and-carrots"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_30-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 6. Canned Pumpkin, Sweet Potatoes and Carrots &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; What do pumpkin, sweet potatoes and carrots all have in common? They are loaded with beta-carotene, a powerful antioxidant. “Beta-carotene helps protect brain cells from oxidative stress and inflammation, which are linked to cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases,” says Manuel. “These vegetables also provide essential vitamins and minerals that support overall brain function and health.”
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Further, she says all three of these vegetables are high in fiber, which plays a crucial role in maintaining brain health through its impact on the gut-brain axis—the communication network that links the gut and the brain, which in turn, benefits your cognitive health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-7-canned-peaches"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; 7. Canned Peaches &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Rofheart notes that canned peaches are packed with antioxidants, plus other brain-healthy nutrients like fiber and vitamins C and K. “The antioxidants in peaches help to lower oxidative stress and protect the central nervous system,” she says. “Preventing oxidative damage and maintaining a healthy central nervous system are key components in maintaining higher cognitive functioning.”&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When choosing canned peaches, Rofheart says to aim to limit added sugar by choosing fruit canned in water or their natural fruit juice, avoiding those canned in syrup or added juice. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_39-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_42-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_43-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Canned foods can be a powerhouse for brain health in a convenient, budget-friendly form. From lycopene-rich tomatoes to omega-3-packed canned fish, these pantry staples can help support memory, focus and cognitive function. Many foods, including leafy greens, citrus fruits and fiber-rich beans, further enhance brain health by reducing inflammation and supporting neuroprotective pathways. With smart choices like these, your pantry holds the key to maintaining cognitive wellness.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON — Local officials held a news conference Tuesday afternoon, their first joint update, on their plan to be proactive to prevent the spread of measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They said as of now there are no active cases of measles in Houston or Harris County. Officials are, however, closely watching school districts and daycares with low vaccination rates, which is less than 95%.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                        
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Director of Houston Health Stephen Williams said they are providing education on the virus for everyone, which includes those daycares and school districts.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is not normal to see an outbreak like this in the United States,” Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The City of Houston is aware of its circumstances. We’ve reached out to all of our stakeholders,” Houston Mayor John Whitmire said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan discussed looks to closely watch daycares and school districts with low vaccination rates, providing educational material and holding vaccine clinics this weekend throughout the Houston Metro area.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re going to look at the numbers and follow the numbers regardless of the neighborhood,” Williams said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials emphasized that there are currently no confirmed cases in the Houston Metro or Harris County area. Each one of the speakers said now is the time to get vaccinated to stay proactive, not reactive.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is it about this particular measles outbreak that has caught your attention?” KHOU 11 News reporter Amanda Henderson asked.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How rapidly it’s spreading in West Texas,” Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine Dr. Peter Hotez said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone here says we need to address this now, why?” Henderson asked.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, prevention is really how we keep our community safe, particularly our most vulnerable population,” Texas Children’s Pediatrics Chief Medical Officer Dr. Sapna Singh said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas Children’s Pediatrics will host a free MMR vaccine clinic on March 8 and 15 from 8 a.m. to noon at their TCP West Loop location. You can find the location of mobile health vans on their website.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legacy Community Health will host a free MMR vaccine clinic on March 8 at 6441 High Star and 3811 Lions Ave.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vaccines are for those 12 months and older.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Measles cases continue to climb&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Tuesday, the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) reported &lt;a href="/article/news/health/measles/texas-measles-outbreak-update/285-4272c68c-74c3-4fe7-981a-e8e1b67054ad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="isPasted"&gt;159 cases&lt;/a&gt; of measles across nine counties in West Texas. &lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials say 129 of those cases are in Gaines and Terry counties. The vast majority of patients are children under 18. A Lubbock child has died from measles.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Officials expect more cases&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a state Capitol hearing Monday, DSHS Commissioner Jennifer Shuford warned that more cases linked to the outbreak are likely. Health officials have not yet determined the source of the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We don't know the individual who introduced it into the community or what the risk factor was for bringing it in. We know that measles is alive and well in other parts of the world, and so all it takes is one traveler to bring it in," Shuford said.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also noted that the virus has spread rapidly due to lower vaccination rates in affected areas.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;p class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How long could the outbreak last?&lt;/h2&gt;                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health officials estimate that the outbreak could last two and a half months or longer, depending on vaccination efforts and containment measures.&lt;/p&gt;                    &lt;/div&gt;
                    &lt;div class="article__section article__section_type_text utility__text"&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men's semen quality is associated with how long they live, according to a study of nearly 80,000 men, &lt;a href="https://apps.crossref.org/pendingpub/pendingpub.html?doi=10.1093%2Fhumrep%2Fdeaf023" target="_blank"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;i&gt;Human Reproduction&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        
                                                                                  
                                         

                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;The study followed the men for up to 50 years and found that those with a total number of motile sperm (sperm that can move or 'swim') of more than 120 million could expect to live two to three years longer than men with a total motile sperm count of between 0 and 5 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the largest study to examine the link between semen quality and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research was led by Dr. Lærke Priskorn, a senior researcher, and Dr. Niels Jørgensen, chief andrologist, both working in the Department of Growth and Reproduction at Copenhagen University Hospital—Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They analyzed data from 78,284 men who had their semen quality assessed between 1965 and 2015 at the public semen analysis laboratory in Copenhagen due to reported couple infertility. This meant that semen quality among the men ranged from very good to those with no sperm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assessment of semen quality included semen volume, sperm concentration, and the proportion of sperm that were motile and a normal shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the follow-up period, the researchers used the data contained in unique Danish national registers, to see how many died from any cause. During this time there were 8,600 deaths, representing 11% of this group of men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of this group, 59,657 men provided semen samples between 1987 and 2015, and for this group more information was available, including educational level as an indicator of socioeconomic status, and registered diagnoses of medical conditions in the 10 years prior to giving a sample.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                                &lt;p&gt;The researchers adjusted their analyses to take account of the extra information that was available for the men who gave samples from 1987 onwards, as that could affect the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Priskorn said, "Previous research has suggested that male infertility and lower semen quality could be associated with mortality. We conducted this study to test the hypothesis and at the same time get an absolute estimate of how much semen quality predicts a man's lifespan and to understand whether diagnosed diseases prior to semen quality assessment might explain some of the reported association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We calculated the men's life expectancy according to their semen quality and found that men with the best quality could expect to live two to three years longer, on average, than men with the lowest semen quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In absolute terms, men with a total motile count of more than 120 million lived 2.7 years longer than men with a total motile count of between 0 and 5 million. The lower the semen quality, the lower the life expectancy. This association was not explained by any diseases in the ten years before semen quality assessment or the men's educational level."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers suggest that poor semen quality may be an indicator of other, underlying factors that affect both fertility and overall health. This might have the potential for detecting &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/health+problems/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;health problems&lt;/a&gt; at the time men have their semen quality investigated.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                            &lt;p&gt;Dr. Jørgensen said, "We need to better understand the association between semen quality and men's general health. However, this study suggests that we can identify subgroups of men with impaired semen quality who are apparently healthy when their semen quality is assessed, but who are at increased risk of developing certain diseases later in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Thus, fertility evaluations, which are typically conducted when the men are relatively young, would serve as an opportunity for detecting and mitigating the risks of other health problems in the longer term. In the current study, we did not analyze whether poor semen quality was associated with earlier deaths from particular causes, such as cancer or heart disease, and this is something we will be studying in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Using other groups of men, we will also try to identify relevant biomarkers that can identify subgroups of men at increased risk. This is key to initiating relevant prevention strategies."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strength of the study is its large size. Limitations include lack of information on health behaviors; assessment of the men's health before semen sampling was limited to diagnoses obtained from the National Patient Register, and only for men who gave samples from 1987; and it was not possible to distinguish between men who had no motile sperm because of an obstruction in their genital tracts and those who had no motile sperm for other reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://apps.crossref.org/pendingpub/pendingpub.html?doi=10.1093%2Fhumrep%2Fdeaf027" target="_blank"&gt;commentary&lt;/a&gt; to accompany the paper, Distinguished Emeritus Professor John Aitken from the School of Environmental and Life Sciences at The University of Newcastle, Australia, calls it a "landmark" publication and sets out the various mechanisms that could be contributing to the link between poor semen quality and shorter life span.&lt;/p&gt;

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    &lt;p&gt;"In this commentary, I have highlighted several potential mediators of such an association, including &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/genetic+defects/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;genetic defects&lt;/a&gt; on the sex chromosomes (X or Y), a compromised immune system, comorbidities, lifestyle factors and chemical pollutants capable of compromising telomeric integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Given the complexity of these factors, we might ask whether they are acting independently, or do they reflect the existence of some fundamental pathological process that cuts across all of these epidemiological pathways?" he writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He suggests a process called &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/oxidative+stress/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;oxidative stress&lt;/a&gt; could be involved in the process. This is an imbalance in the body of molecules called '&lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/free+radicals/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;free radicals&lt;/a&gt;' and antioxidants, which inhibit oxidation. Free radicals are known to damage cells and to influence &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/tags/semen+quality/" rel="tag" class="textTag"&gt;semen quality&lt;/a&gt;, and oxidative stress is known to be involved in the aging process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He writes, "Any factor (genetic, immunological, metabolic, environmental or lifestyle) that enhances overall levels of oxidative stress could reasonably be expected to drive changes in the semen profile and subsequent patterns of mortality, as observed by Priskorn et al. . . ."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Furthermore, an etiology grounded in oxidative stress might also explain the relationships observed between complications of pregnancy (preeclampsia, gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes) and female mortality later in life . . .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"An overarching oxidative stress hypothesis also accords with the observation that circulating antioxidant levels are generally higher in women than men, just as their telomeres are usually longer . . . So perhaps, for both genders, the secret to achieving both high fecundity and healthy aging is to monitor oxidative stress and adopt measures to maintain a balanced redox state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Could it be that simple? Clearly, much food for thought."&lt;/p&gt;

            People who have higher levels of strong, agile sperm may live nearly three years longer than those with poor swimmers incapable of making it to their destination,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;according to new research. The large-scale study followed more than 78,000 men for 50 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000g3b6mqvemisx3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The ability of sperm to properly swim through the female reproductive tract to reach and fertilize an egg is called motility.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000h3b6msqm5o603@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In absolute terms, men with a total motile count of more than 120 million (per milliliter of semen) lived 2.7 years longer than men with a total motile count of between 0 and 5 million,” said lead study author Lærke Priskorn, a researcher and doctoral candidate at Copenhagen University Hospital — Rigshospitalet in Denmark, in a statement.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000i3b6mnpv7y7lc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            To translate that into ages, a man with extremely poor sperm motility might be expected to live up to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;77.6 years, while a man with extremely high motility might survive to 80.3 years, according to the study &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/humrep/deaf023" target="_blank"&gt;published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Human Reproduction.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000j3b6mgjodmhfj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The fact that there is an association between semen quality and longevity is an important finding,” said Dr. Michael Eisenberg, professor of urology and director of male reproductive medicine and surgery at Stanford University School of Medicine. He was not involved in the new research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000k3b6mwu5eash6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There have been prior studies that suggest this link between reproductive health and overall health,” Eisenberg said in an email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000l3b6mtqeygho0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the new report, researchers compared the quality of sperm samples taken between 1965 and 2015 from men undergoing infertility testing in Copenhagen. The quality of the men’s sperm was then compared with national medical records gathered by the Danish national health service.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000m3b6m7k9mwti4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “The lower the semen quality, the lower the life expectancy,” Priskorn said. “This association was not explained by any diseases in the ten years before semen quality assessment or the men’s educational level.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000n3b6m9ndhmxv1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Motility counts are typically provided in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10929669/" target="_blank"&gt;percentages,&lt;/a&gt; not total numbers. The &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240030787" target="_blank"&gt;World Health Organization&lt;/a&gt; considers a man’s sperm normal if about 42% of the sperm in each sample of ejaculate is capable of swimming to their destination.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000o3b6mo032c7zz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            However, a motility count of less than 5 million per milliliter of semen&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is associated with a severe case of &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22477-oligospermia-low-sperm-count" target="_blank"&gt;oligospermia&lt;/a&gt;, or low sperm count, which often leads to male infertility, the study said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000p3b6m73x8jkvq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A sperm motility of about 125 million per milliliter of semen is normal for a fertile male, Eisenberg said. However, that doesn’t guarantee male fertility, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000q3b6mdit0i6s6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            If not for fertility, why would testing semen be a benefit? Because it could also be a marker for male health problems at younger ages, said John Aitken, a distinguished professor emeritus from the School of Environmental and Life Sciences at the University of Newcastle, Australia, who was not connected to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000r3b6m1kxuiczv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In men, it appears to be their semen profile that is providing the most significant information concerning their future health and wellbeing,” Aitken wrote &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/humrep/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/humrep/deaf027" target="_blank"&gt;in an editorial&lt;/a&gt; published alongside the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000s3b6mdbkesnwq@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “If spermatozoa really are the canaries in the coal mine of male health, the obvious question to ask is, why?” Aitken posited. “What possible factors could link the ultimate life expectancy of males with the quality of their semen profile in early adulthood?”
    &lt;/p&gt;

  

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000t3b6mzxst3ngu@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            According to Aitken, one answer explaining the association might be oxidative stress, caused when free radicals run rampant. Free radicals are unstable molecules that can damage DNA and cellular function and lead to cell death throughout the body, including the testes and sperm.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000u3b6mstkpzyhp@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Any factor (genetic, immunological, metabolic, environmental or lifestyle) that enhances overall levels of oxidative stress, could reasonably be expected to drive changes in the semen profile and subsequent patterns of mortality,” Aitken posited.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000v3b6mt39cgbjh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Smoking, excessive alcohol, sun exposure, pesticides, industrial chemicals and air pollutants are just a few of the ways free radicals are activated, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/antioxidants-fact-sheet" target="_blank"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000w3b6mn42ie0h7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The body does have a way to fight back — with antioxidants. Nicknamed “free radical scavengers,” antioxidants can prevent and repair damage caused by some types of free radicals, experts say.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000x3b6mvemsz3z7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While supplements have failed to show promise against free radicals, fruits, vegetables, nuts and grains with key vitamins and minerals are excellent sources of antioxidants, according to the Cleveland Clinic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000y3b6mdt5yuadh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Citrus fruits, red and green peppers, and broccoli are full of the antioxidant vitamin C, while nuts, sunflower seeds, spinach and broccoli are good sources of vitamin E, another antioxidant, the clinic &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/oxidative-stress" target="_blank"&gt;states on its website&lt;/a&gt;.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm7v1uezi000z3b6m7zt8t1b4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Salmon and tuna contain selenium, as does brown rice, eggs and whole wheat bread. Beta carotene, another antioxidant, can be found in carrots, apricots, kale, mangos and sweet potatoes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

We continue to monitor the situation. If there is a confirmed case of measles, the OSDH will notify the public and share information necessary to protect the public's health."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OSDH later said in a statement: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Quote"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt; "The individual was negative for measles but positive for having immunity.&lt;br&gt; There is a process for confirming a case of measles, and that can only be done through the Oklahoma State Department of Health (OSDH). While residents may be tested and diagnosed at a health care facility, that facility must work with the OSDH to confirm a positive case. Many factors contribute to having a confirmed positive case. It is important to be aware of what type of test is conducted. If measles is suspected, multiple types of tests can be performed to determine if measles is present or if the individual has immunity to measles." "Health care facilities and schools are encouraged to follow their normal reporting processes to OSDH to ensure timely public health investigations. These processes should be followed prior to any public posting about reportable diseases. The OSDH is monitoring the situation and will notify the public and news media if/when a case is confirmed in Oklahoma. In the meantime, if you receive information about a case that is not directly from the OSDH, please contact us before reporting." &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    
        &lt;p class="Quote-attribution"&gt;Oklahoma State Department of Health&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bartlesville Public Schools said "a staff member at Wayside Elementary School was diagnosed with measles by an Oklahoma hospital. However, the Oklahoma State Department of Health has not been able to confirm that diagnosis." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 News is reaching out to the school district and the Oklahoma State Department of Health to clarify the initial alert. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bartlesville Public Schools issued a warning after a staffer at an elementary school tested positive for measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a post on the district's Facebook page, they said a staffer in Wayside Elementary School tested positive for the measles on March 4, one day after being inside the school. Custodians at that school did complete a deep cleaning and are now going back over as many areas as possible.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is a highly contagious and airborne disease. Most people in the United States have a low risk for contracting it due to a vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A child who was not vaccinated has died from measles in West Texas, the first death in an outbreak that began late last month and the first from measles in the U.S. since 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.kjrh.com/health/cdc-deploys-rapid-response-officers-to-texas-to-address-the-measles-outbreak" class="ListItem " data-cms-ai="0"&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="Link" href="https://www.bps-ok.org/page/measles" data-cms-ai="0"&gt;The school posted about the disease on their website to help inform parents.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The district included specific vaccination rates for their students: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="Quote"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;As of March 2025, 92% of the district's students had received 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, 3% had received 1 dose, and the remaining 5% had received no doses or their status was unclear in our database.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Odds are that you or someone you know was impacted by the flu this winter. But when will we see the flu wind down?&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div id="Entry-content" class="entry-content Entry-content "&gt;
                                                
                                
                &lt;p&gt;Have you gotten the flu this season? Odds are that you or someone you know was impacted by the flu this winter. But when will we see the flu wind down?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The positivity rate in February was 90%,” said Dr. Jonathan Thierman, chief executive of LifeBridge ExpressCare Urgent Care Centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said they’ve seen the number of flu cases at their clinics increase significantly this winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think that one of the things that drove this late flu spike was the concurrent extreme cold spike that we had around the same time,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kerri Layman, chair of emergency medicine at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, said they’ve also seen quite a &lt;a href="https://wtop.com/news/2025/02/harsh-flu-season-has-health-officials-worried-about-brain-complications-in-children/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;peak in flu cases recently&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This year has been a very bad flu season,” Layman said. “We’re still seeing pretty high rates of flu test positivity, so about one in four tests are still positive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she said she’s seeing the numbers come down, which is a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the last two weeks, the number of cases have started to wane a bit, so hopefully we’re seeing the peak and then it will start to decrease,” Layman said.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When will flu season be over?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I hope before April, but I think only time will tell,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thierman also said an April timeline seems about right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I would expect it’s going to continue to fall in March, certainly by April, we’ll see lower numbers,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how can people protect themselves until then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The best thing to do is all the standard things we all learned during COVID and continue to do, which is mostly hand hygiene and preventing from touching your face or your nose, specifically after you’ve touched surfaces or other people,” Thierman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Thierman and Layman said it’s not too late to get the vaccine, and that a lot of people should plan to get the vaccine next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making sure you’re teaching your children good habits, Layman said, is important as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you do get vaccinated, that might offer a bit of added protection. Some of the other ways to prevent flu are hand washing constantly, especially when thinking about young children,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

The highly contagious norovirus is rampant in South Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norovirus has torn through the United States this winter, peaking early in some parts of the country but taking hold in South Florida over the last few weeks. It arrives with cramps, diarrhea, vomiting, fever, dizziness and fatigue, symptoms that set in about 12 to 48 hours after exposure to viral particles. On average, one person with norovirus will infect two to seven others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It’s a tough illness to have to deal with,” said Dr. Maria Garcia, an emergency medicine physician at Baptist Health South Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garcia is seeing firsthand what &lt;a href="https://data.wastewaterscan.org/?plantId=d3ff13c4&amp;amp;target=Noro_G2&amp;amp;selectedLocation=%7B%22label%22%3A%22North%20Miami,%20FL%22,%22level%22%3A%22plant%22,%22value%22%3A%22d3ff13c4%22%7D"&gt;Florida wastewater data&lt;/a&gt; over the most recent 21 days confirms: Norovirus concentration levels through the state are high. Federal surveillance data only shows reported outbreaks in Florida through the end of January. Florida, like most of the south, had higher levels than in previous years as of Jan. 31, according to the Centers for Disease Control &amp;amp; Prevention (CDC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="s2nPlayer k-gbDoqmaV" data-type="float" data-s2n-api="dfm_stn_player_script_id_gbDoqmaV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those who caught the virus is Leslie O’Shea, of Fort Lauderdale, who said she missed three days of work last week due to the symptoms. She even slept on the bathroom floor, feeling lightheaded and struggling to stand up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was the sickest I have been in a long time,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar experiences fill social media posts, with photos of people in bed declaring “I wouldn’t wish norovirus on my worst enemy” and “This virus is straight from the pits of hell.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say the surge of cases is being driven by a new dominant strain of norovirus called GII.17[P17], which has displaced a strain that had been around for decades. Lower population immunity to this new strain could explain this year’s harsh wave of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new strain, the CDC said, is linked to cruise-ship outbreaks in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, South Florida’s proximity to cruise ports may be exacerbating the spread. According to the CDC’s &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vessel-sanitation/cruise-ship-outbreaks/index.html"&gt;Vessel Sanitation Program&lt;/a&gt;, nine voyages that have departed from or docked in Florida this year have&lt;a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2025/02/11/cdc-tracks-another-norovirus-outbreak-on-florida-based-cruise-ship/"&gt; resulted in outbreaks&lt;/a&gt; — seven were confirmed to be norovirus. Passengers exposed to norovirus often have overnight stays in Florida and travel through local airports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;So, what to do?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medical experts want Floridians to know that hand sanitizer does not kill norovirus. You need to thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Norovirus is also hard to kill on surfaces, where it can live for days to weeks. If someone in your household vomits in the bathroom, you need to clean every contaminated surface with a disinfectant (typically bleach). The virus also can spread through &lt;a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2024/12/21/norovirus-is-rampant-blame-oysters-cruise-ships-and-holiday-travel/"&gt;contaminated food&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hand washing is key after you use the bathroom and before you prepare food,” said Dr. Indulekha Gopal, medical director for infection control at Broward Health North. “The main way it spreads is person to person and not washing your hands properly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what else you need to know, according to medical experts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It doesn’t take much of the virus to make someone sick. Only a small particle is needed to pass on the infection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Doctors recommend that adults and children stay hydrated with Pedialyte. “Pedialyte is less irritating to the stomach than Gatorade and people tolerate it better,” Gopal said. “Make sure to sip it frequently.” Dehydration can lead to other symptoms, like dizziness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zofran or antinausea medications may be necessary to curb the vomiting and fluid loss and allow you to take a fever reducer. However, antidiarrheal medications can be tricky, said Garcia from Baptist Health South Florida. “Some bacterial infections present similar symptoms and antidiarrheal medications will worsen them. You need to discuss it with a healthcare provider,” she said. “My recommendation is to avoid them.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can’t get norovirus from someone coughing or sneezing, so masking won’t help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Symptoms from norovirus usually last one to three days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can still spread norovirus for days after you’re feeling better. “If you are preparing food and had norovirus a few weeks ago, you may be still shedding, so adhere to strict hand hygiene protocols,” Gopal said.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people get better after a few days. But not everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you are dizzy, weak and the vomiting is out of control, you may have to seek medical attention,” Gopal said. “Dehydration can be problematic for young children, the elderly and anyone who is immunocompromised.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There is no antiviral treatment for norovirus, and while there isn’t currently a vaccine, drug manufacturer Moderna is working on one. Any norovirus vaccine would require an educated guess as to which strains would be likely to circulate in a given year, which is the same concept behind the annual flu vaccine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it is possible to get norovirus more than once in a season, Garcia added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If there are multiple strains around, you might have had the virus and created immunity to one strain and someone is around you with another strain and you get infected again,” she said. “That’s why washing your hands is so important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;South Florida Sun Sentinel health reporter Cindy Goodman can be reached at cgoodman@sunsentinel.com.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Another parent said he was refusing to inoculate his 1-year-old because he didn’t want to “experiment” on his child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;These and other recent discussions about measles vaccinations at Dr. Alex Cvijanovich’s Albuquerque, New Mexico, pediatric practice have been fraught since the highly contagious virus started making national headlines — and they’re only getting more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The people who are willing, are willing to give it early,” said Cvijanovich, who is also a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics. “But the people who have dug in their heels, it just becomes a more frustrating conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;As virus cases rise and the United States recorded its&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/person-dies-measles-west-texas-outbreak-rcna193812" target="_blank"&gt; first measles death in a decade&lt;/a&gt;, pediatricians are in a dilemma. How do they convey the seriousness of the virus to vaccine-skeptical parents while also quelling the anxieties of families who want to immunize their newborns but can’t yet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;It’s a delicate balancing act, according to six doctors in practices from West Virginia to Washington state. The measles, mumps and rubella vaccination has a proven track record against the highly contagious disease, with two doses of the shot 97% effective against measles, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html#:~:text=One%20dose%20of%20MMR%20vaccine%20is%2093%25%20effective%20against%20measles,(weakened)%20live%20virus%20vaccine." target="_blank"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. Decades of &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" target="_blank"&gt;studies have shown it to be safe&lt;/a&gt; and have refuted false claims that it is linked to autism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The measles outbreak so far has been concentrated in West Texas. But it comes at a pivotal moment for the country: Vaccine hesitancy, on the uptick for years, accelerated during the Covid pandemic. And now misinformation about vaccines has been spreading, fueled in part by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who led a large anti-vaccine advocacy group before becoming head of Health and Human Services last month. Shortly after his confirmation, Kennedy vowed to investigate the schedule for childhood vaccines that prevent dangerous diseases like measles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Pediatricians say they’re seeing a lot of fear, both from parents who trust vaccinations and those who don’t, and they worry the anxiety from both sides will create confusion that will hamper public health efforts. The death of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/person-dies-measles-west-texas-outbreak-rcna193812" target="_blank"&gt;an unvaccinated child&lt;/a&gt; in Texas last month has not been enough to sway everyone to immunize their children, and pediatricians are worried more kids will get sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I feel like this is still snowballing,” said Dr. Lesley Motheral, a pediatrician in Lubbock, Texas. “I think we still have a lot of work to do, to be very honest with you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html" target="_blank"&gt; CDC recommends&lt;/a&gt; administering the first MMR shot at around age 1 and the second at ages 4 to 6. In cases where an infant has been exposed to measles or is traveling to a known outbreak area, pediatricians can administer a dosage as early as 6 months old — something some parents have pleaded for as more measles cases are reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Most children in the United States receive their MMR vaccinations on schedule, with nearly 93% receiving the shots by kindergarten, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7341a3.htm" target="_blank"&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But in West Texas, where the measles outbreak is concentrated with at least &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/news-alerts/measles-outbreak-feb-28-2025" target="_blank"&gt;159 reported cases&lt;/a&gt;, vaccination rates are significantly lower. In Gaines County, the epicenter of the outbreak, the immunization exemption rate was more than 17% for the 2023-2024 school year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.dshs.texas.gov/immunizations/data/school/conscientious-exemptions" target="_blank"&gt;health department data&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Experts say that at least 95% of a community must be vaccinated to protect against a measles outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“We rely on herd immunity for measles prevention,” said Dr. Christina Hermos, division chief of pediatric infectious disease and immunology at UMass Memorial Children’s Medical Center. “Measles is so incredibly contagious that you only need one person flying in or traveling to a region to give a nonimmune person a case.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The respiratory virus spreads rapidly because it is transmitted through droplets that can linger in the air or on surfaces for up &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/causes/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;to two hours&lt;/a&gt;, meaning an infected person doesn’t have to remain in a room to contaminate other people. Measles causes a telltale rash, but an infected individual can spread the virus up to four days before the rash appears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Measles also causes fevers and red, watery eyes and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" target="_blank"&gt;can lead to complications&lt;/a&gt; such as pneumonia or, in rare cases, brain damage and death. For every 1,000 children who get measles, about one to three will die from respiratory and neurologic complications, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;the CDC says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The United States &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/hcp/clinical-overview/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;declared measles eliminated in 2000&lt;/a&gt;, despite some cases being reported since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Pediatricians now fear the country could backslide in its containment efforts, especially because Kennedy has long criticized childhood vaccinations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;As the measles outbreak has unfolded under his watch, he has not urged widespread vaccination, &lt;a href="https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2025/03/03/health/warren-letter-rfk-vaccines" target="_blank"&gt;drawing ire&lt;/a&gt; from health experts and politicians. In an &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/robert-f-kennedy-jr-measles-outbreak-call-action-all-us" target="_blank"&gt;op-ed published on Fox News’ website&lt;/a&gt;, he called the decision to vaccinate “a personal one” and wrote, “All parents should consult with their healthcare providers to understand their options to get the MMR vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Elizabeth Meade, a Seattle pediatrician, said she finds it “enormously concerning” to have a vaccine-skeptic person as the nation’s health secretary. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I think there is this real sense among people in the United States that they are not at risk for these diseases, especially if they’re not traveling outside of the U.S.,” said Meade, who is also an American Academy of Pediatrics spokesperson. “Unfortunately, it is just not true.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Some parents who once supported immunization have since changed their minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“I see incredibly intelligent people coming in,” said Hermos, who in addition to being an infectious diseases doctor is an associate professor of pediatrics at UMass Chan Medical School. “Their child has a full vaccination record, and then they’re due for their next one, and they’re completely convinced that they’re making a decision between two potentially harmful things for their kids, like, ‘I could potentially harm them with this vaccine versus I could potentially harm them with this disease of the vaccine.’” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In Morgantown, West Virginia, pediatrician Dr. Lisa Costello has found that acknowledging the common ground she has with vaccine-hesitant parents is helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Everyone’s coming from the space that they’re trying to do what’s best for their child that they love, and it’s a matter of having those conversations and sharing from the medical literature we have on this,” said Costello, an assistant professor of pediatrics at West Virginia University. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;But it’s keeping some parents of newborns home out of fear that, because others in the practice might not be vaccinating their children regularly, their tiny babies who are too young to get the MMR shot could be at risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The doctors said there are steps that parents can take to protect their children if they are too young to get the vaccination, such as asking the adults who spend time near their kids if they are vaccinated themselves; asking at their day care if all children who are eligible for vaccinations have been immunized; and not being around anyone who is or recently was sick. They also recommended bringing up early vaccination with their pediatrician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“There are those folks now that are calling that are anxious about it and want to get it even earlier than the recommended schedule,” said Dr. Steven Abelowitz, medical director of Ocean Pediatrics in Orange County, California. “It’s OK to do it after six months, but make sure the insurance covers it and it’s not out of pocket.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In Texas, Motheral said her local health department has been giving free MMR vaccinations. She hopes more people will agree to receive them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;“It is so sad that a disease that we once felt was eradicated in this country, and really still should be, is making a resurgence,” she said. “Even one death for measles is too many.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 22:44:04 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMitgFBVV95cUxPa1BNdVoxRXlNT1JZOWNrRFEwTHZINUJOWFVsV2s2dGg0cXhWekkyckdZUXFEQ2JZNVJnQnUwV3BIT19YeENIZWV6QUQyb050Ym02bHE2QnEtSmlFUS1qNjNlNWVxLXFrbkoyb3d4Nk5ueHJsZ3NiS2pnVDBQS1ROWmZZd3gxTGlJNnBwNXBXZk1ZTE5sVGRnWS1xdlFYWUxlOU5tTHlpVG15WmVGRHVVUnlvVk8wZ9IBVkFVX3lxTE1LYjB3QnBLN3RBVHNNT2VrMnpJYWZQQnlhemFCS2tVMmd2T1otRnhNN1ZuZjZ2WkVxb21FYkdhTEl3UldQTXduV19ILWdxN0xXcG9sZDBR</guid></item><item><title>What Is a 'Labia Puff' — and Why Are Women Getting It? - AOL</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicEFVX3lxTE0wYTh3UEtmRU9KZTlyOEk4QmFQSkJxa1hLQkVRcmFMQ1d2Z2tGX3R0UjVMbU9IUFRKUDRZb25vb3RBTDRkLWNZX0xjbUxrWW5tU2daNzBTZXN0SjdsYmxIemJqSm5mNUdiTTJURnlJa28?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cavan Images/Getty; Inti St Clair/Getty&lt;/p&gt; (Left:) Stock image of a doctor with a syringe; (Right:) A woman wears a bikini.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A trendy &lt;a href="https://people.com/cosmetic-procedures/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cosmetic surgery procedure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cosmetic surgery procedure&lt;/a&gt; promises to give women a more youthful look — on their vulvas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Called a 'Labia Puff', the procedure injects &lt;a href="https://people.com/celebs-are-getting-their-filler-dissolved-but-is-everyone-else-8772012" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:fillers;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;fillers&lt;/a&gt; or fat into the labia majora, the outer lips of a woman’s genitals, to give it a fuller look.

People who generally fall into this eating pattern may eat red meat, but not regularly. Seafood and lean poultry are more common protein sources (about two to three servings per week), and meals are centered around healthy fats like nuts and olive oil, low-fat dairy, whole grains, and fruits and vegetables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="EkqkG IGXmU nlgHS yuUao lqtkC TjIXL aGjvy "&gt;Fiber should be on your radar (remember, this is the stuff your gut microbes feed on).

			&lt;p&gt;Analysis of human brain tissue revealed differences in how immune cells behave in brains with  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="153764" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease compared to healthy brains, indicating a potential new treatment target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University of Washington-led research, published in 2023, discovered &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microglia"&gt;microglia&lt;/a&gt; in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease were &lt;span&gt;in a pre-inflammatory state &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;more frequently, making them less likely to be protective.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microglia are immune cells that help keep our brains healthy by clearing waste and preserving normal brain function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to infection or to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/for-the-first-time-scientists-capture-video-of-brains-clearing-out-dead-neurons"&gt;clear out dead cells&lt;/a&gt;, these nifty shape-shifters can become less spindly and more mobile to engulf invaders and rubbish. They also &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1202529"&gt;'prune' synapses during development&lt;/a&gt;, which helps shape the circuitry for our brains to function well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's less certain what part they play in Alzheimer's, but in people with the devastating neurodegenerative disease, some microglia respond too strongly and &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/imcb.12301"&gt;may cause inflammation&lt;/a&gt; that contributes to the death of brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately,  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/clinical-trials" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73032" data-postid="153764" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;clinical trials&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/braincomms/fcaa109"&gt;anti-inflammatory medications for Alzheimer's haven't shown significant effects&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_143533" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-143533" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ComputerArtworkOfSynapseBetwwwnNeurons_R_U_642.jpg" alt="Blue neurons connecting " class="size-medium wp-image-143533" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ComputerArtworkOfSynapseBetwwwnNeurons_R_U_642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ComputerArtworkOfSynapseBetwwwnNeurons_R_U_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/ComputerArtworkOfSynapseBetwwwnNeurons_R_U_642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-143533" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Computer Illustration of a synapse between two neurons. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MADmTH5y7O4/"&gt;Science Photo Library/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To look closer at the role of microglia in Alzheimer's disease, University of Washington neuroscientists Katherine Prater and Kevin Green, along with colleagues from multiple US institutions, used brain autopsy samples from research donors – 12 who had Alzheimer's and 10 healthy controls – to study the gene activity of microglia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a new method to enhance &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SnRNA-seq"&gt;single-nucleus RNA sequencing&lt;/a&gt;, the team was able to identify in depth 10 different clusters of microglia in the brain tissue based on their unique set of gene expression, which tells the cells what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;hree of the clusters hadn't been seen before, and one of them was more common in people with Alzheimer's disease. This type of microglia has genes turned on that are involved in inflammation and cell death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the researchers found that microglia clusters in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease were more likely to be those in a pre-inflammatory state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means they were more likely to produce inflammatory molecules that can damage brain cells and possibly contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The microglia types in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease were less likely to be protective, compromising their ability to pull their weight in cleaning up dead cells and waste and promoting healthy brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_103339" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-103339" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/PhotomicrographOfMicrogliaInAD.jpg" alt="Photomicrograph of microglia from a brain affected by Alzheimer's disease." class="size-full wp-image-103339" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/PhotomicrographOfMicrogliaInAD.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/PhotomicrographOfMicrogliaInAD-589x415.jpg 589w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2023/08/PhotomicrographOfMicrogliaInAD-600x422.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-103339" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Photomicrograph of microglia (green) from a brain affected by Alzheimer's.

So we can't just look at a person's brain and say for sure what type of microglia they have; keeping track of how microglia change over time could help us understand how they contribute to Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"At this point, we can't say whether the microglia are causing the pathology or whether the pathology is causing these microglia to alter their behavior," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news-releases/study-links-changes-in-brain-immune-cells-to-alzheimers"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Prater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research advances our understanding of these cells' role in Alzheimer's disease and suggests certain microglia clusters may be targets for new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is hopeful that their work will lead to the development of new therapies that can improve the lives of people with Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Now that we have determined the genetic profiles of these microglia, we can try to find out exactly what they are doing and hopefully identify ways to change their behaviors that may be contributing to Alzheimer's disease," Prater &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news-releases/study-links-changes-in-brain-immune-cells-to-alzheimers"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"If we can determine what they are doing, we might be able to change their behavior with treatments that might prevent or slow this disease."&lt;/p&gt;

This type of microglia has genes turned on that are involved in inflammation and cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Overall, the researchers found that microglia clusters in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease were more likely to be those in a pre-inflammatory state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This means they were more likely to produce inflammatory molecules that can damage brain cells and possibly contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The microglia types in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease were less likely to be protective, compromising their ability to pull their weight in cleaning up dead cells and waste and promoting healthy brain aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="relative mb-4"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="relative text-sm mt-1 pr-2.5"&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The scientists also think microglia can change types over time. So we can't just look at a person's brain and say for sure what type of microglia they have; keeping track of how microglia change over time could help us understand how they contribute to Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"At this point, we can't say whether the microglia are causing the pathology or whether the pathology is causing these microglia to alter their behavior," &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news-releases/study-links-changes-in-brain-immune-cells-to-alzheimers" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Prater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;This research advances our understanding of these cells' role in Alzheimer's disease and suggests certain microglia clusters may be targets for new treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The team is hopeful that their work will lead to the development of new therapies that can improve the lives of people with Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"Now that we have determined the genetic profiles of these microglia, we can try to find out exactly what they are doing and hopefully identify ways to change their behaviors that may be contributing to Alzheimer's disease," Prater &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news-releases/study-links-changes-in-brain-immune-cells-to-alzheimers" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"If we can determine what they are doing, we might be able to change their behavior with treatments that might prevent or slow this disease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The study has been published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-023-00424-y" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nature Aging;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Aging&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in August 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Related News&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Mar 2025 22:05:11 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxNOW40dzctWi1mcmxIRzdtUUIyaXJ3V2FvMHBTZ2ZtckQxODNWSnNaTUdfNU5RR2Y5T0twRG01LVZIWGxwclljQjdzUjFiUkMxZHBxVGwwSERuenpSakF1eHU5TW02SFdkdGpPcFZwdkxYNWpwbWgxMkxLclFack5CeTlJMmZMb0lkcmc</guid></item><item><title>These 4 reproductive issues have just been linked to heart disease — one affects 25% of women - New York Post</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMimAFBVV95cUxNTjh1cWY0THJacDVNZWJXaXphYm4zS1A2Z3UzYWlmVTJYblp5cXdmMGRFTy1DUjVsbEctaF91UkROdVB2RkFwZ1BGTmZWa3NqRDZRNkV0NWhCZENveFBWYnVSNWpGUFJRV2tKNjF6bmFvdzlIODZ3NjhCNnJVS2pLcHZSd0pIbzl6VERVU3RTcHAwNkNsWFhoaQ?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="single__content entry-content m-bottom "&gt;
							


&lt;p&gt;It’s not just a pain in the uterus — reproductive health problems could also break your heart.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://heart.bmj.com/content/early/2025/01/21/heartjnl-2024-324675" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; suggests that women dealing with common gynecological issues, like heavy or irregular periods, could be at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease and conditions that affect blood flow to the brain, like stroke. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are becoming increasingly aware of how impactful gynecological conditions are on quality of life as they are actively happening, like endometriosis’ impact on pain and fertility,” &lt;a href="https://healthsci.mcmaster.ca/common-gynecological-disorders-linked-to-increased-risk-of-heart-vascular-disease-study/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;said Mathew Leonardi&lt;/a&gt;, senior author and assistant professor at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Now, we are getting closer to understanding that having these gynecological conditions might also indicate a higher risk for developing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease later in life.”&lt;/p&gt;

1024px"&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;US women have a higher risk of dying from heart disease than men.  &lt;span class="credit"&gt;Getty Images/iStockphoto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p id="connatix-outstream-video"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get to the heart of the issue, researchers reviewed 28 studies covering 3.2 million women. Their analysis found that those with at least one gynecological issue faced a 28% higher risk of heart disease or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More specifically, the risk of ischemic heart disease — a condition where the heart is deprived of oxygen due to reduced blood supply — was 41% higher. The risk of cerebrovascular disease was 33% higher.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Researchers noted that the increased risk was especially pronounced in women with endometriosis or &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/02/06/health/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-sufferers-face-greater-suicide-risk-study/"&gt;polycystic ovary syndrome&lt;/a&gt; (PCOS).&lt;/p&gt;


	



&lt;p&gt;“Another interesting finding was that, in some studies, this increased risk seemed to manifest relatively early in life, suggesting that early intervention or monitoring might make a difference over the long term,” &lt;a href="https://www.euronews.com/health/2025/02/26/could-having-a-gynaecological-disorder-affect-your-heart-and-brain-new-research-suggests-i"&gt;Leonardi told Euronews Health&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“This should further raise the awareness and the relevance of gynecological conditions in society and in our health care system.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Menstruation typically comes with mild discomfort, irritability, abdominal cramps and fatigue. But for women with additional gynecological problems, that time of the month can be particularly challenging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/female-blood-disorders/about/heavy-menstrual-bleeding.html#:~:text=Heavy%20menstrual%20bleeding%20is%20one,every%205%20women%20has%20it." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Heavy menstrual bleeding&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most common issues women report to their doctors, affecting more than 10 million Americans each year. This can lead to anemia, causing symptoms like weakness, dizziness and fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;

Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Menstrual irregularities are also widespread, impacting an estimated &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10733621/#:~:text=Normal%20menstruation%20lasts%202%20to,as%20abdominal%20cramps%20%5B5%5D." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;14% to 25% of US women&lt;/a&gt; of childbearing age. Cycles that are shorter or longer than the typical 21 to 35 days, or those that are heavier or lighter than usual, are considered irregular.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/03/18/health/how-to-know-when-menstrual-pain-may-be-a-sign-of-a-more-serious-condition/"&gt;endometriosis&lt;/a&gt;, a condition where tissue similar to the uterine lining grows outside the uterus, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9127440/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;affects more than 6.5 million American women&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;There’s also PCOS, a hormonal condition that affects an &lt;a href="https://www.endocrine.org/patient-engagement/endocrine-library/pcos#:~:text=Polycystic%20ovary%20syndrome%20(PCOS)%20is,6%20million%20women%20have%20PCOS." target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;estimated 5 million to 6 million women in the US&lt;/a&gt;. Common symptoms include irregular or absent periods, excess body hair, acne, weight gain and infertility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the exact connection between gynecological problems and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases is unclear, the researchers believe biological factors — like systemic inflammation and estrogen production — could be at play.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;There may also be an overlap between gynecological and cardiovascular risk factors. For instance, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/06/03/health/5-supplements-you-should-avoid-if-you-have-metabolic-syndrome/"&gt;metabolic syndrome&lt;/a&gt; — a cluster of health problems that increase the risk of heart disease and diabetes — is often present in people with PCOS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the US for both sexes, it claims more lives among women each year. In fact, nearly &lt;a href="https://www.goredforwomen.org/en/about-heart-disease-in-women/facts" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;half a million women die annually from heart disease&lt;/a&gt; — more than from all forms of cancer combined.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;Women in the US also suffer about &lt;a href="https://www.stroke.org/en/about-stroke/stroke-risk-factors" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;55,000 more strokes annually&lt;/a&gt; than men, and they are more likely to die from them. Stroke is the third leading cause of death for women, killing more than 85,000 each year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several factors may be driving these disparities, including differences in anatomy, physiology and hormones. The new research on common gynecological health problems, heart disease and cerebrovascular disease could help further explain the gap between men and women. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="comments-inline-cta" data-comment-count data-prompt="What do you think?"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The researchers pointed out some limitations in their analysis, noting that more than half of the studies reviewed were scored as having a very high risk of bias. They also didn’t address certain aspects of cardiovascular disease, such as atrial fibrillation — a common heart rhythm disorder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Our review is a starting point in exploring the association between common gynecological problems and cardiovascular health, but more high-quality studies are needed to investigate this association further,” said lead author &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/giorgia-colombo-phd-050b16146/?locale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Giorgia Colombo&lt;/a&gt;, a medical resident at the UK’s West Middlesex University Hospital, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.&lt;/p&gt;
