Do you need that third or fourth cup of coffee to make it through the afternoon at work? Such signs of sleepiness may be a red flag of a serious sleep deficit that could put you in physical danger and harm your long-term health, according to a new position paper by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sleepiness is a serious health concern with wide-reaching consequences," said AASM President Dr. Eric Olson, a pulmonologist and sleep medicine specialist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From drowsy driving crashes to workplace errors and long-term health risks, the effects of excessive daytime sleepiness impact individuals and society every day," Olson said in a statement about the paper, which is supported by 25 different medical organizations including the American Academy of Neurology, the National Safety Council and the American Academy of Family Physicians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not getting a quality night's rest of at least seven to eight hours has been linked to the development or worsening of diabetes, depression, heart and kidney disease, high blood pressure, obesity and stroke, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With one-third of U.S. adults reporting they experience excessive sleepiness, the importance of identifying interventions that recognize, assess, and treat it cannot be understated," Olson added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All too often people write off signs of sleepiness, such as dozing off during a work meeting, as an insignificant issue instead of a sign of a potentially dangerous sleep deficit, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;Someone who is fully rested will not fall asleep in meetings, no matter how boring the meeting is.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;– Kristen Knutson, sleep specialist&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nodding off in boring meetings is an indication of insufficient sleep. Someone who is fully rested will not fall asleep in meetings, no matter how boring the meeting is," said sleep specialist Kristen Knutson, an associate professor of neurology and preventive medicine at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Excessive daytime sleepiness can impair performance and be an indicator of underlying sleep disorders or other issues," Knutson said via email. "If someone is experiencing excessive daytime sleepiness regularly, they should discuss this with their physician."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A hidden danger&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body does odd things when it's continuously sleepy, including overcoming those yawns and sending signals that you are, in fact, coping with the lack of sleep. However, those signals couldn't be further from the truth, said AASM board member and second author Dr. Indira Gurubhagavatula, a professor of sleep medicine at the Veteran's Administration Medical Center at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The unfortunate thing is data shows that with chronic partial sleep deprivation the ability to perceive our own level of impairment is no longer accurate — we think we're OK when we're really not," Gurubhagavatula said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we do actual tests to measure how well your brain is functioning — reaction time, the ability to recall, memory tests, coordination — we find people are actually making a lot of mistakes," she said. "And it's scary because they still have this inappropriately high level of confidence that they are OK."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With continued sleepiness, the brain may take mini naps, or what specialists call microsleeps, Gurubhagavatula said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;q&gt;We find people are actually making a lot of mistakes. And it's scary because they still have this inappropriately high level of confidence that they are OK.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;h2&gt;– Dr. Indira Gurubhagavatula, Penn Medicine &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Your brain is actually going into brief two-second, three-second, 10-second microsleeps and then popping back out and you may not even realize this is happening," she said. "It can be very dangerous if you're driving or doing something that involves safety. So if you do feel like you might fall asleep, pay attention to that, as it's an indication it's not safe to drive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 100,000 car accidents a year are linked to drowsy driving, according to statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tests of sleepiness&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you know if your sleepiness is crossing into the danger zone? You can measure it on various scales, including the &lt;a href="https://sleep.hms.harvard.edu/epworth-sleepiness-scale" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Epworth Sleepiness Scale&lt;/a&gt;, Gurubhagavatula said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions on the test include how likely you'll fall asleep while sitting quietly after a lunch with no alcohol; lying down in the afternoon; sitting inactive in a public place; sitting and reading; sitting and chatting with someone; riding as a passenger in a car for an hour; sitting in traffic for a few minutes while driving; and watching television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We ask patients to rate from zero to three how likely they are to fall asleep during these eight sedentary situations," she said. "The maximum score is 24, which indicates that you're very, very sleepy. We generally consider scores above 10 to being clinically significant and worth intervention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As sleep deprivation progresses, dangerous symptoms of sleepiness can increase, Gurubhagavatula said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have droopy eyelids, your body is slumping, you're having trouble staying upright, and some people even notice vertigo, the room spinning, hands shaking with severe deprivation," she said. "You can also be reckless and impulsive, like you don't care. That's another symptom."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Additional causes of sleepiness&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sleep disorders such as sleep apnea, insomnia, restless leg syndrome and circadian rhythm sleep disorders, as well as chronic pain conditions and medications can also contribute to sleepiness, which will be ruled out by a sleep specialist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can also ask your pharmacist about your prescriptions, and you should also consider any over-the-counter medications," Gurubhagavatula said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certain lifestyle behaviors also can contribute to chronic sleepiness, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Things like too much caffeine, alcohol use before bed, using marijuana, the amount of exercise you're doing, and practicing poor sleep hygiene, such as sleeping in a bright, cold, hot or noisy bedroom, will definitely affect how your sleep will be organized and how refreshing it's going to be," Gurubhagavatula said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people turn to alcohol or marijuana in the mistaken belief that it can improve sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="kt_disclaimer"&gt;

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;&lt;span&gt;However, the new study injects life back into that theory by looking at stool samples and brain scans at the same time and homing in one particular sets of metabolites. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team, from the University of Southern California, said the findings could lead to treatments targeting the gut 'while also hopefully alleviating some of the symptoms that are the most uncomfortable for [autistic children],' like bloating and constipation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, they cautioned more large-scale, definitive research is still needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lisa Aziz-Zadeh, lead study author and professor at the Brain and Creativity Institute at the University of Southern &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/california/index.html" id="mol-5fe889e0-193d-11f0-948e-9b5860b87d38"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, said: 'We demonstrated that gut metabolites impact the brain, and the brain, in turn, affects behavior. Essentially, the brain acts as the intermediary between gut health and autism-related behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Previous studies highlighted differences in gut microbiomes and brain structures in autism, but our research connects the dots.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The findings come as one in 36 children in the US have autism, adding up to just under 2million. In the early 2000s, that number was closer to one in 142, a four-fold rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts are working to uncover the causes of the increase, &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14069191/autism-air-quality-pollution-Haitham-Amal-nitric-oxide.html"&gt;raising concerns over environmental factors&lt;/a&gt; like microplastics and pesticides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They have also noted diagnostic changes have made it easier for doctors to spot the condition, especially in once overlooked groups like girls and adults. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study, published Monday in &lt;a target="_blank" class="" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58459-1#Sec9"&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/a&gt;, compared 43 children with autism to 41 neurotypical children from healthcare clinics in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/los-angeles/index.html" id="mol-170e4800-192d-11f0-948e-9b5860b87d38"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;All participants were between eight and 17 years old, and the average age was 12. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;About half of the autistic participants took medications like antidepressants, antipsychotics and stimulants for their behaviors. None of the neurotypical children took prescription drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers asked all of the children to stay away from antibiotics for a month and probiotics for two weeks, as both medications can alter the gut microbiome. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study took place over the course of two days. On the first day, researchers gave the children behavioral assessments. On the second day, participants brought in stool samples and underwent MRI scans of their brains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Parents were also asked to report which diet their children most closely followed: Standard American (high consumption of processed foods, red meat, poultry, eggs and dairy), Modified American (high consumption of whole grains, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy, vegetables, fruits and some processed foods), Mediterranean, Paleo, vegetarian, gluten-free, dairy-free, low FODMAP or other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers honed in on metabolites in participants' stool that followed the 'tryptophan pathway.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typtophan is an amino acid found in turkey, salmon, eggs, and seeds that breaks down into the metabolite serotonin, which is crucial for brain functions like emotional processing, social interaction and learning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers noted because more than 90 percent of the body's serotonin is produced in the gut, changes in gut health could influence serotonin levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nerve cells in the gut then send signals to the brain, a phenomenon known as the gut-brain axis.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Children in the study with autism were more likely to have mothers who used antibiotics during pregnancy, which could have caused gut microbiome disturbances (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found children with autism had lower levels of typtophan metabolites than neurotypical children, resulting in lower serotonin levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This lead to higher rates of &lt;span&gt;gastrointestinal issues like bloating and constipation and an increased prevalence of changes in areas of the brain responsible for social behaviors, leading to 'ASD symptomology.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Aziz-Zadeh said: 'We know that children with autism have brain differences — certain parts of their brain are either less active or more active compared to typically developing children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We also know they often experience gastrointestinal issues, such as constipation, stomach pain and other digestive problems. Additionally, autism is associated with various symptoms, including repetitive behaviors and social difficulties.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with diet, lower typtophan metabolites may also be caused by antibiotics disturbing the gut microbiome. The team found children with autism had a higher likelihood of their mothers using antibiotics during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'Prenatal maternal antibiotic exposure has been shown to affect the maternal microbiome, which plays an important role in the fetal brain’s exposure to altered maternal microbial metabolites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This prenatal mechanism has been hypothesized to play a role in the etiology of ASD.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers cautioned 'out study is unable to demonstrate causality,' meaning it can't directly show metabolite levels cause autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Autism advocacy groups have also said the causes of autism are not fully understood and many experts suggest there isn't one specific cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations to the study, including not looking at children under eight years old and having more boys than girls.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

On the second day, participants brought in stool samples and underwent MRI scans of their brains. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Parents were also asked to report which diet their children most closely followed: Standard American (high consumption of processed foods, red meat, poultry, eggs and dairy), Modified American (high consumption of whole grains, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy, vegetables, fruits and some processed foods), Mediterranean, Paleo, vegetarian, gluten-free, dairy-free, low FODMAP or other. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers honed in on metabolites in participants' stool that followed the 'tryptophan pathway.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Typtophan is an amino acid found in turkey, salmon, eggs, and seeds that breaks down into the metabolite serotonin, which is crucial for brain functions like emotional processing, social interaction and learning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers noted because more than 90 percent of the body's serotonin is produced in the gut, changes in gut health could influence serotonin levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Nerve cells in the gut then send signals to the brain, a phenomenon known as the gut-brain axis.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Children in the study with autism were more likely to have mothers who used antibiotics during pregnancy, which could have caused gut microbiome disturbances (stock image)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found children with autism had lower levels of typtophan metabolites than neurotypical children, resulting in lower serotonin levels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This lead to higher rates of &lt;span&gt;gastrointestinal issues like bloating and constipation and an increased prevalence of changes in areas of the brain responsible for social behaviors, leading to 'ASD symptomology.'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Aziz-Zadeh said: 'We know that children with autism have brain differences — certain parts of their brain are either less active or more active compared to typically developing children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'We also know they often experience gastrointestinal issues, such as constipation, stomach pain and other digestive problems. Additionally, autism is associated with various symptoms, including repetitive behaviors and social difficulties.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Along with diet, lower typtophan metabolites may also be caused by antibiotics disturbing the gut microbiome. The team found children with autism had a higher likelihood of their mothers using antibiotics during pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The researchers wrote: 'Prenatal maternal antibiotic exposure has been shown to affect the maternal microbiome, which plays an important role in the fetal brain’s exposure to altered maternal microbial metabolites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This prenatal mechanism has been hypothesized to play a role in the etiology of ASD.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the researchers cautioned 'out study is unable to demonstrate causality,' meaning it can't directly show metabolite levels cause autism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Autism advocacy groups have also said the causes of autism are not fully understood and many experts suggest there isn't one specific cause. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;There were several limitations to the study, including not looking at children under eight years old and having more boys than girls.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Frequently visiting the emergency room at your local hospital due to smoking weed may increase your risk for developing dementia by 72 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;For the latest study, the researchers studied over six million people aged 45 to 105 years old from Ontario, Canada, who had no history of dementia between January 2008 and December 2021. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Out of this, they identified 16,275 people who had developed dementia and had a history of cannabis use that required acute care - defined as a visit to the emergency department (ED) or hospitalization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;These people were then compared to people in three groups: individuals with an all-cause acute care visit; the general population and individuals with acute care due to alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Results showed that five percent of people aged 45 years or older who had received treatment for cannabis in acute care were diagnosed with dementia within five years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;On the other hand, only 1.3 percent of the general population (non smokers who do not require acute care) and 3.6 percent of individuals receiving care for another reason developed dementia in a five year span. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, 19 percent of people in the same group who had received cannabis-related care had developed dementia within 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Merely 5.5 percent of the general population and 14.8 people receiving care for another reason developed dementia in a decade's time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study also found that the risk of dementia in individuals with acute care for cannabis was 31 percent lower over the next five years than individuals who required acute care for alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Pictured: Dr Daniel Myran, an author of the study and Associate Scientist at The Ottawa Hospital&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Regular cannabis use can affect the brain, particularly areas responsible for memory, learning, attention, decision-making, coordination, emotion and reaction time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Certain research suggests that long-term cannabis use may cause shrinkage of the hippocampus, responsible for forming new memories and learning, and reduce overall blood flow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Shrinking (atrophy) of the hippocampus can often cause cognitive problems like memory issues, difficulty with attention, and impaired executive function  - leading to dementia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Long-term cannabis use can also impact cardiovascular health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;THC, a psychoactive compound found in cannabis, can make the heart beat faster and can raise blood pressure immediately after use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Frequent weed intake can impact the blood pressure levels in the body and increase risk of stroke, heart disease and other vascular diseases in the long term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can affect the overall blood flow in the body and interfere in the proper functioning of the organs, including the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The drug has seen a meteoric rise over the past decade, culminating in legal recreational use in 24 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Long-term or frequent cannabis use has also been linked to increased risk of psychosis or schizophrenia in some users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, the authors noted that more research is needed to establish a clear link between cannabis use and cognitive decline.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Daniel Myran, an author of the study and Associate Scientist at The Ottawa Hospital said: 'While we collectively need more research to better understand potential risks of regular cannabis use on cognition and dementia, we hope these findings can inform discussion between patients and healthcare providers.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Last year, private cannabis prescriptions doubled - reaching nearly 180,000 - according to the Care Quality Commission (CQC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The study was published in JAMA Neurology today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 15:37:38 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswFBVV95cUxNZEkyckhRWlRJcl9JMXdQNDhodUJsOTVFaGhJVzRDbWdlUF85ZWtrUUFTMjliX2JTcFg2RkhaZTMwV19TbE5oZUdxVFdwZlotRFBPeldRR3dSbjNVV1I2NXl0dTJIQmx1QklTRkw0cy1YZEVtMjk4SkRIc21ybTEwZWdyN2VWeGlrS2hqcXFrVVVKdHBXcERCLXRtN1FXVXM1WW50OVJlUk94VWdGcVBpTU5HMNIBuAFBVV95cUxPWEtIUlhoU3FVdXl5UWxfazJ5R2NTTEJzZjNZNkNNZzFRUUdlQlE5dk1IRUpYeUF5T2NaUnVtWXZ5d3ZnWk5QMEhHMmdCZV90dDlwRXJFM0x0WFp1Mkp0MzJkVGgzX1E5Ty1fYU1pczJkU016a1YwVkMyZ09OdmhJVzlMNHd5MUx2ZXRLa0FiT1pzeHh0STJtXzNJeGRCZnJfTFlIaEZyTEtxR3ZKS1FBS1E1bklXMm9H</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，两种廉价药物的组合可以挽救心脏病发作后的生命-《卫报》 | Combination of two cheap drugs could save lives after heart attack, study finds - The Guardian</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMi0wFBVV95cUxOUDJEWmRJSXk0Ymo2SThQeVZlMlpDZ1pQYjlOU29IbUJNNDlmWVN4ekpPMzd0WHJuZDRfMGtKYVhXQzNJTzh5bDhDcVBmOTNVZ3NYVGNidS16dVMxV0pob0lJZGx6MUx2UlJibUF2TjFsWldiX01NQ0ZrRE9tU2NLb21iYVlIQkswdW1MdGpJYnpsTjBfMDNSSV84ejlMNjdZMS1tay1hemdrc3BlRmZkTmJDeTMwN3p2Y3BINTJJVC1CSWUzdXk1dVQ1Y2JzVGFZWW93?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article-body-commercial-selector article-body-viewer-selector dcr-11jq3zt"&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Thousands of heart attacks or strokes could be prevented and lives saved with a combination of two cheap drugs, a study suggests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death worldwide, with heart attacks the most common acute event.

and Lund University in Sweden found that by giving heart attack patients two drugs together – statins and ezetimibe, a cholesterol-lowering drug – their risk of another heart attack, stroke or death was reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“This study shows that we could save lives and reduce further heart attacks by giving patients a combination of two low-cost drugs,” said Prof Kausik Ray, of Imperial’s School of Public Health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“But at the moment patients across the world aren’t receiving these drugs together. That is causing unnecessary and avoidable heart attacks and deaths – and also places unnecessary costs on healthcare systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Our study shows the way forward. Care pathways must now change for patients after this type of heart event.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Researchers analysed patient data to measure the potential impact of the dual combination of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;They compared patients who received statins and ezetimibe within 12 weeks of a heart attack, those who were given statins with ezetimibe added between 13 weeks and 16 months, and others who got just statins with no ezetimibe at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Data from 36,000 Swedish patients who had a heart attack between 2015 and 2022 was analysed, and advanced statistical models were used to emulate a clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Those who received statins and ezetimibe within 12 weeks of a heart attack and were able to lower cholesterol to the target level early had a better prognosis and less risk of new cardiovascular events and death than those who received the add-on treatment later, or not at all, according to the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Our findings suggest that a simple change in treatment guidelines could have a huge impact on patients,” said Ray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“Ezetimibe is already widely available and prescribed for relatively low cost. This add-on therapy could be rolled out for around £350 a year per patient, which is a huge cost saving compared to the lasting impacts of treating heart attacks and the impact they have on patients’ lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Margret Leosdottir, an associate professor at Lund University and a senior cardiology consultant at Skåne University Hospital in Malmö, Sweden, said she hoped the findings would lead to changes in global guidelines, in order to “prevent unnecessary suffering and save lives”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Leosdottir said the combination therapy was currently not typically offered to heart attack patients globally because a “precautionary principle” was applied to avoid side-effects and overmedication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;“However, there are positive effects from applying both medicines as soon after the infarction [heart attack] as possible. Not doing this entails an increased risk. In addition, the drug we have examined in the study causes few side-effects and is readily available and inexpensive in many countries.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Guardian</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 15:37:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi0wFBVV95cUxOUDJEWmRJSXk0Ymo2SThQeVZlMlpDZ1pQYjlOU29IbUJNNDlmWVN4ekpPMzd0WHJuZDRfMGtKYVhXQzNJTzh5bDhDcVBmOTNVZ3NYVGNidS16dVMxV0pob0lJZGx6MUx2UlJibUF2TjFsWldiX01NQ0ZrRE9tU2NLb21iYVlIQkswdW1MdGpJYnpsTjBfMDNSSV84ejlMNjdZMS1tay1hemdrc3BlRmZkTmJDeTMwN3p2Y3BINTJJVC1CSWUzdXk1dVQ1Y2JzVGFZWW93</guid></item><item><title>家庭建议：如果我在怀孕期间没有听从我嫂子的建议，一切都会有所不同。-石板 | Family advice: If I hadn't listened to my sister-in-law's advice during my pregnancy, everything could've been different. - Slate</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiigFBVV95cUxNeThIdGR0Z0I4QTVCTnR3OUU5eXJMQXUtMWhDWGdDc0ZpY05GTnVucExVTUNGZ29rVmxVYjJRQmVlRkFDZ0M0Y1hQTC1UZ00xQWNRNGxnSXVaalQ2OUhQWGVPQ0pFb3M1eEFjM2w4SVVsRWlMTnVacFl1b1FVbFRzcjN0ekNUZU1heHc?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" itemprop="mainEntityOfPage"&gt;

When I became pregnant, my sister-in-law (who is a nurse) asked who I had chosen as my doctor. I shared the name, and she simply replied, “Oh.” That worried my husband, who asked why she responded like that. She was a bit evasive and just said she’d “heard some things” from friends who had worked with/for that office and didn’t think overall she was the greatest provider. I ended up switching to an office she recommended.&lt;/p&gt;



  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="131" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9h76n23004o3b73nx5thgrh@published"&gt;To make a long, emotional story short, throughout the pregnancy there were small warning signs that I asked about that my doctor always confidently explained away. I ended up delivering my baby at 27 weeks due to an emergent medical condition; all the concerns I had voiced throughout the pregnancy were verified as warning signs of the conditions that my baby and I ended up having. My baby spent four months in the NICU after birth. While it probably couldn’t have been avoided entirely, our medical team (which ended up including the doctor I had originally chosen) was fairly confident that some simple interventions and more aggressive monitoring could’ve helped manage and push off the onset of the issue until later in my pregnancy, allowing my baby more time before birth.&lt;/p&gt;

I hate that I listened to her and didn’t stick with the doctor I had decided on after research. I beat myself up about the possibilities. Maybe a different doctor would’ve listened to my questions more, maybe a different one would’ve been concerned by the early indicators and taken steps, and maybe my child wouldn’t have the long-lasting health effects she now has. I went to therapy for a year and it helped a lot. My therapist reinforced that having a negative connection in my head between my SIL and my pregnancy makes sense given the situation. She said I am handling it and working through it well and appropriately, but it will take a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="192" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9h6blyz001v3b73k6vrl4jv@published"&gt;Well, my SIL is now pregnant and has decided that I am a great person to bring her every pregnancy-related question to, as well as asking me to accompany her to appointments that her husband can’t attend. I can’t do it. I certainly don’t wish her or her baby anything but an easy pregnancy and happy, healthy outcome, but I have no desire to be involved in her pregnancy. I don’t want to hold her hand while she gets ultrasounds done. I don’t want to discuss her pregnancy symptoms and whether I had them or not, I don’t want to help her plan her birth experience. However, my (polite!) attempts to not be more involved are being taken very personally. She’s commenting on it to me and our other family members, who are then calling, texting, and emailing me, emphasizing how she really needs support right now and I’m in an ideal place to provide it. My mother-in-law specifically called sobbing about how much it hurts her that she can’t be there in person for her daughter and how much it would mean to her to know I was there alongside her.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="slate-paragraph slate-graf" data-word-count="122" data-uri="slate.com/_components/slate-paragraph/instances/cm9h6bss1002n3b73yvka8gha@published"&gt;I’m so sorry for your traumatic birth experience, and I’m happy to hear that therapy has helped you cope in its aftermath. I hope you are proud of yourself for accessing the help you need.&lt;br&gt;I agree that it doesn’t do anyone any good for you to go into the specifics of your struggle not to associate your sister-in-law with your birth experience. However, the family is aware of your baby’s premature birth and, presumably, at least some of the ongoing health complications. So you need to be firmer and clearer about that and own the fact that you are still dealing with your own trauma. Thus, you can’t help your SIL the way she wants. Your script might go something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

That said, I am still processing the physical and emotional trauma that resulted from [my baby’s] birth, even after all this time. I don’t talk about it a lot, but it is still something that weighs on me heavily. I spent a year seeing a therapist, and although things have gotten better, I still feel vulnerable about it all. So while I, again, am happy for [SIL], it is impossible for me to show up for her the way she wants me to. This isn’t something I want to talk about any further, so I’m asking that you trust me that this decision is what is best for me and my health, my baby, and even my sister-in-law.”&lt;/p&gt;

Registry - which has been collecting information on all cancer cases diagnosed and treated in Puerto Rico since 1950 - they discovered that during these events, rates of CRC diagnoses dropped during and shortly afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, late-stage diagnoses eventually exceeded expectations, suggesting that &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/health/article-14596467/weight-loss-mom-stage-3-colon-cancer-age-38.html"&gt;limited access to cancer screening&lt;/a&gt; services due to these disasters likely hindered timely CRC diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;A record number of young people are being diagnosed with late-stage colon cancer due to disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, new findings suggest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A previous study by the American Cancer Society found that late stage diagnoses across the board were 7 percent more likely in 2020 and that communities of color were particularly hard hit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;They noted that, with nearly two million new cancer diagnoses each year, these diagnostic delays could result in tens of thousands of additional deaths and millions of dollars in added health care costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;If colon cancer is detected and treated in its early stages, the five-year survival rate is approximately 90 percent, while it is around 60 percent if it is diagnosed in its advanced stages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The cost of treatment also dramatically increases, with early-stage colon cancer costing around $40,000 to treat, while advanced stages can exceed $300,000. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Colon cancer diagnoses are on the rise among younger adults aged 15 to 34 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In a separate study also published today investigating this trend, Dr Arvind Trindade from Rutgers University School of Medicine calls it 'worrisome'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He led a recent body of research investigating the rise of colon cancer among younger people and his hope is that his findings will help doctors to form a more effective approach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;He concluded: 'Heightened awareness of this trend is necessary when evaluating younger patients with possible corresponding symptoms.'&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the University of Puerto Rico study investigating disasters and their knock-on effects, the researchers noted that during these events medical services may be delayed or inaccessible due to damaged infrastructure, overburdened health care facilities, or shortages of medical staff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;This can lead to late diagnoses, interruptions in treatment, and an overall worsening of survival and other health outcomes for patients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team found that from 2012–2021, a total of 18,537 residents received a first-time diagnosis of CRC. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the month the hurricanes struck, 161.4 CRC cases would have been expected in the absence of any interruption, but instead, only 82 cases were diagnosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After a slight upward trend, there was a second decline following the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In April 2020, the observed number of CRC cases was 50, but the expected number of cases without interruptions would have been 162.5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;By the end of the study, the estimated numbers of patients with early-stage CRC and those aged 50–75 years (the recommended screening age range) did not reach expected numbers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, numbers of patients with late-stage CRC and those outside the recommended screening age range exceeded expected numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Commenting on the findings, co–lead author Tonatiuh Suárez-Ramos, MS said: 'These findings suggest that limited health care access during these events may have delayed cancer detection and may have worsened health outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'This issue is especially critical in Puerto Rico, since the health care system already faces important challenges.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Meanwhile, Dr Yisel Pagán-Santana, who also worked on the study, said the findings will help develop 'more adaptable and resilient strategies to ensure the continuity of essential care.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The team's hope is that the research will help governments in other regions facing similar challenges to push through policies to help strengthen health care systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Senior author Dr Karen J. Ortiz-Ortiz concluded: 'By evaluating the impact of events like hurricanes and the COVID-19 pandemic, we hope to start the conversation about long-term solutions to improve cancer care coordination, reduce health disparities, and ensure continued access to care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Ultimately, our goal is to help people live longer, healthier lives by making health care systems more resilient and accessible, even in times of crisis.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Scientists found that the pandemic lockdowns lead to much higher levels of inflammation in people's bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;It's thought that the lack of exposure to common germs weakened our immune systems, leaving us more vulnerable to infections and diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Researchers in the Netherlands tracked 1,800 people before, during and after the draconian measures, which also included school closures and mask mandates, were imposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Lab tests showed that before the lockdowns, patients exposed to a variety of bacteria and viruses generally had low levels of inflammation in their bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But after the measures were imposed and people were forced to stay home, lab tests showed that exposure to bacteria or viruses lead to 'hyperinflammation'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Experts said the high levels of inflammation could lead to people suffering from more severe symptoms in response to common infections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr Mihai Netea, the physician who led the study, said: 'In our daily lives, we are constantly exposed to various mico-organisms. This helps train our immune system, teaching it to recognize which micro-organisms are dangerous and which are harmless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'During the lockdown, we missed that interaction because everyone stayed home and avoided each other. As a result, during and immediately after the lockdown periods, immune cells exposed to micro-organisms displayed a less well-regulated response, predisposing to hyperinflammation.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the US, lockdowns were decided by state, with Democrat states like New York and California heading into the restrictions much faster than their Republican counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;p&gt;Your next computed tomography, or CT, scan might be riskier than commonly assumed. A study out today calculates that CT scans are contributing to a substantially greater share of cancer cases than past research has suggested.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists at the University of California, San Francisco, led the research, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.0505?guestAccessKey=afde7c2e-df6b-4e7b-9ced-7a15ed74dc1d&amp;amp;utm_source=For_The_Media&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ftm_links&amp;amp;utm_content=tfl&amp;amp;utm_term=041425"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in JAMA Internal Medicine. They estimated that out of the millions of people who received CT scans in 2023, over 100,000 would eventually develop cancer in their lifetime. The scientists argue that CT scans should be seen as a cancer risk factor on par with excessive alcohol drinking, but at least some outside experts aren’t convinced.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CT scans are commonly used to screen for and diagnose potential health problems or to help guide doctors during certain medical procedures. But they require exposing people to doses of ionizing radiation, a known carcinogen. Much of the research on how ionizing radiation increases cancer risk comes from studying the Japanese survivors of the atomic bomb attacks during World War II. But several &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36493793/"&gt;large&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02620-0"&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; studies have found a link between the radiation exposure from CT scans and increased cancer cases among children and young adults.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The study authors wanted to conduct an updated analysis of people’s lifetime risk of cancer associated with CT scans across all ages, especially since CT scanning has &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/radiation-risk-from-medical-imaging#:~:text=Over%2080%20million%20CT%20scans%20are%20performed%20in%20the%20United%20States%20each%20year%2C%20compared%20with%20just%20three%20million%20in%201980."&gt;become more common&lt;/a&gt; over the years.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Based on survey data from hospitals and imaging labs across the country, they estimated that there were 93 million CT scans performed on 61.5 million people in 2023. They then calculated that about 100,000 radiation-induced cancers would arise from these exams, based on the expected doses of radiation received and where on the body the test was performed. The risk estimates are about three to four times higher than what past studies have found, the authors say.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;About two million new cancers are diagnosed in the U.S annually. So if Americans’ level of CT use and radiation dose from these tests remain constant, CT scans could eventually account for roughly 5% of all new cancer cases every year—a &lt;a href="https://acsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.3322/caac.21858#:~:text=excess%20body%20weight%20(7.6%25%20and%207.3%25%2C%20respectively)%2C%20and%20alcohol%20consumption%20(5.4%25%20and%204.1%25%2C%20respectively)."&gt;projected level of risk similar&lt;/a&gt; to obesity (7.6%) and alcohol consumption (5.4%), according to the study.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“CT is frequently lifesaving, yet its potential harms are often overlooked, and even very small cancer risks will lead to a significant number of future cancers given the tremendous volume of CT use in the United States,” the authors wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Mark Supanich, head of the division for Diagnostic Medical Physics at Rush University’s Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, isn’t so sure about the team’s math, however. “I believe that the estimates of CT-related cancers predicated by this study are likely overestimated,” Supanich, who is not affiliated with the research, told Gizmodo in an email.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He argues that their numbers are based on some assumptions that might not ultimately hold up.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;“A large portion of CT scans are performed on patients who are actively undergoing diagnosis or treatment of significant disease or injury,” he notes. “Including these patients in the statistical estimation of possible future cancers results in a significant overestimation of theoretical future cancer risk.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The authors did try to account for this factor at least somewhat by removing tests performed in the last year of life from their calculations. In a secondary analysis, they also excluded tests performed up to two years before death, which did lessen their estimate of CT-related cancers. But Supanich argues that the exclusion period should be much longer (one study cited by the authors excluded CT tests performed in the last five years before death, he notes).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Supanich adds that the science is still evolving on how much low-dose radiation truly contributes to cancer risk. So until we can firmly quantify this risk, he says, it’s best to take any claims that CT scans are resulting in a huge number of cancer cases every year with “several large grains of salt.” In light of this uncertainty, he also takes umbrage with the authors’ comparison to other known cancer risk factors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“In my opinion comparing CT scans as a risk factor for cancer comparable to those of alcohol consumption or excess body weight, as the authors do, is wholly inappropriate and carries with it a significant risk of doing more harm than good,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The authors have called for several reforms in how CT tests are conducted, which might include ordering scans less often in certain scenarios or trying to reduce the radiation dose per test. Supanich notes that there has already been some progress on these fronts. A 2019 report from the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements &lt;a href="https://www.rsna.org/news/2020/march/radiation-doses-decreasing"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that the average medical radiation dose per test (including CT and other imaging procedures) had declined 20% over the past decade, for instance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But as scary as this study might look, it seems unlikely that it will be the final word on the cancer risk posed by CT scans. And Supanich says that people in general shouldn’t be too worried about getting their next CT test, given their well-known pros, which can include helping detect cancer early.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The theoretical risks for any individual receiving a CT scan are miniscule compared to current cancer incidence rates (&lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/risk-prevention/understanding-cancer-risk/lifetime-probability-of-developing-or-dying-from-cancer.html"&gt;about 40%&lt;/a&gt; over an average person’s lifetime) and the benefits for CT are large,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
                          &lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;More Americans are receiving computed tomography (CT) scans than ever before, and while this technology &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/blog/ct-scan-saves-lives"&gt;can save lives&lt;/a&gt;, some scientists are concerned about the potential for low doses of ionizing radiation to increase  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/cancer" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73077" data-postid="158103" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;cancer&lt;/a&gt; risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At an individual level, the theoretical chance of developing cancer from a CT scan is &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/medical-x-ray-imaging/what-are-radiation-risks-ct"&gt;thought to be very minimal&lt;/a&gt;, if it exists at all, and patients should not be scared of undergoing these tests if they are deemed medically necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the number of CT examinations performed each year in the US has increased by more than 30 percent since 2007, and researchers suggest that unwarranted tests are exposing the population to unnecessary radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A team in the US and the UK now predicts that low levels of ionizing radiation from CT scans could theoretically account for 5 percent of all new cancer diagnoses in the US. CT scans conducted in 2023 could be responsible for an estimated 103,000 future cases of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's based on some assumptions and historical data from high radiation events, but if right, it would put CT scans on par with other significant risk factors for cancer, like alcohol consumption, at least at a population level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"CT is frequently lifesaving, yet its potential harms are often overlooked, and even very small cancer risks will lead to a significant number of future cancers given the tremendous volume of CT use in the United States," &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.0505"&gt;write&lt;/a&gt; the international team of analysts, led by epidemiologist Rebecca Smith-Bindman from the University of California, San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of now, these are just theoretical risks, but that doesn't mean they aren't worth considering. While scientists know that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.2203/dose-response.07-013.Brooks"&gt;high doses of radiation cause cancer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6447446/"&gt;conclusive evidence&lt;/a&gt; to link low-level radiation to cancer is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential association is &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/prehospital-and-disaster-medicine/article/risk-of-cancer-from-ct-scans-and-other-sources-of-lowdose-radiation-a-critical-appraisal-of-methodologic-quality/23464B0D825CD456741B77476F9997F7"&gt;mostly based&lt;/a&gt; on long-term studies of atomic bomb survivors and those exposed to nuclear power plant meltdowns. For instance, in a group of &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/radiation-risk-from-medical-imaging"&gt;25,000 Hiroshima survivors&lt;/a&gt;, who received a dose of ionizing radiation on par with three or more CT scans, there was a slight but significant increase in cancer risk across a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether those results extend to CT scans remains &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2672242/"&gt;hotly debated&lt;/a&gt;, and the theoretical risks must be weighed against the myriad benefits of this technology, which can now alert patients and doctors to a whole variety of hidden diseases and injuries with very low doses of radiation (about the same amount &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org.au/iheard/can-radiation-from-medical-tests-cause-cancer"&gt;you absorb from your environment&lt;/a&gt; over three years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new predictions on cancer risk are again based on these historical tragedies, but compared to previous analyses, they consider more detail on the actual radiation exposure, which can &lt;a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/cancer/radiation-risk-from-medical-imaging"&gt;depend on&lt;/a&gt; the type of CT device, the scanning duration, the size of the patient, and the sensitivity of their targeted body part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anonymous data comes from 143 hospitals and outpatient facilities across the US, catalogued in the UCSF International CT Dose Registry. Using statistics from 2016 to 2022, researchers predicted 93 million CT examinations were carried out in 2023, on roughly 62 million patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the associated radiation risks, the team estimates that CT scans in 2023 may be tied to 103,000 future cancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"To empirically quantify lifetime risk would require decades-long follow-up studies of very large populations," the authors &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.0505"&gt;admit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, their results suggest that some people may be more susceptible to cancer from low-dose ionizing radiation than others.  Adults receive the vast majority of CT scans, but estimated radiation-induced cancer risks were higher in children and adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_158133" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-158133" class="wp-caption alignnone"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CancerRiskCT-642x368.png" alt="Cancer Risk CT " class="size-medium wp-image-158133" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CancerRiskCT-642x368.png 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CancerRiskCT-724x415.png 724w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CancerRiskCT-768x440.png 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CancerRiskCT-1536x880.png 1536w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CancerRiskCT-600x344.png 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/04/CancerRiskCT.png 1584w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-158133" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;The projected number of future cancers (left axis; dark blue and orange circles) against a conservative estimate of cancer incidence (right axis; light blue circles and triangles). &lt;span&gt;(Smith-Bindman et al., &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;2025)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those receiving CT scans at under one year of age, for instance, seem to have a higher potential lifetime risk for thyroid cancers, and this appears more common among female patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far more research is needed to confirm if low-dose ionizing radiation actually impacts a person's cancer risk, and how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Estimated overall cancer risks from CT radiation doses are similarly high in Australian studies, &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/ct-scans-could-be-responsible-for-5-percent-of-new-cancer-diagnoses-every-year"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; medical radiation specialist Pradip Deb from RMIT University. She argues it is important to avoid unnecessary CT scans if radiation-free procedures can do the same job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiographer Naomi Gibson, President of the Australian Society of Medical Imaging and Radiation Therapy, agrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Although the findings highlight the need for vigilance around long-term radiation exposure, this should not discourage the use of CT imaging when clinically justified," Gibson &lt;a href="https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/ct-scans-could-be-responsible-for-5-percent-of-new-cancer-diagnoses-every-year"&gt;explains&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"In appropriately selected cases, the diagnostic and therapeutic value of CT scans significantly outweighs the potential radiation-associated risks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was published in &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2025.0505"&gt;&lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            With the first generation of people exposed widely to technology now &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/09/health/mobility-maintenance-aging-stiffness-wellness/index.html"&gt;approaching old age&lt;/a&gt;, how has its use affected their risk of cognitive decline?
    &lt;/p&gt;

            That’s a question researchers from two Texas universities sought to answer in a new meta-analysis study, a review of previous studies, published Monday in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-025-02159-9" target="_blank"&gt;Nature Human Behavior&lt;/a&gt;. The query investigates the “&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5855412/" target="_blank"&gt;digital dementia hypothesis&lt;/a&gt;,” which argues that lifetime use may increase reliance on technology and weaken cognitive abilities over time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us00063b6ow00z0f2m@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “We say a &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/25/health/maximize-brain-health-wellness/index.html"&gt;really active brain&lt;/a&gt; in youth and midlife is a brain that is more resilient later,” said Dr. Amit Sachdev, medical director of the department of neurology and ophthalmology at Michigan State University, who wasn’t involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us00073b6o7eujsxjy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But the authors discovered that the digital dementia hypothesis may not bear out: Their analysis of 57 studies totaling 411,430 older adults found technology use was associated with a 42% lower risk of cognitive impairment, which was defined as a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or dementia, or as subpar performance on cognitive tests.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us00083b6ojh1vebls@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Forms of technology included computers, smartphones, internet, email, social media or “mixed/multiple uses,” according to the new study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us00093b6obxqnskz9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “That these effects were found in studies even when factors like education, income, and other lifestyle factors were adjusted was also encouraging: the effect doesn’t seem just due to other brain health factors,” co-lead study author Dr. Jared Benge, associate professor in the department of neurology at the University of Texas at Austin’s Dell Medical School, said via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000a3b6onxk93iau@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The authors searched eight databases for studies published through 2024, and the 57 chosen for their main analysis included 20 studies that followed participants for about six years on average and 37 &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4885177/" target="_blank"&gt;cross-sectional studies&lt;/a&gt;, which measure health data and outcomes at one point in time. The adults were age 68 on average at the beginning of the studies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000b3b6ojj1it47e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While technology use was generally linked with a lower risk of cognitive decline, the findings for &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/03/16/health/social-media-effect-on-brain-gupta-wellness/index.html"&gt;social media use&lt;/a&gt; were inconsistent, the authors said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000c3b6oqnfqu48j@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            None of the 136 studies the authors reviewed overall reported an increased risk of cognitive impairment correlated with technology use — a consistency that is “really quite rare,” said co-lead study author Dr. Michael Scullin, professor of psychology and neuroscience at Baylor University, via email.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000d3b6owrutczg9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The research is “a really well-organized and -executed meta-analysis of essentially the entire field over the last 18 years or 20 years,” said Dr. Christopher Anderson, chief of the division of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. Anderson wasn’t involved in the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000e3b6os9oixldz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But if you’re thinking the study’s findings mean you’re free to use technology to your heart’s content since your brain will be fine anyway — not so fast.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000f3b6oivpuuvrw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Our findings are not a blanket endorsement of mindless scrolling,” Benge, who is also a clinical neuropsychologist at UT Health Austin’s Comprehensive Memory Center, said. “They are instead a hint that the generation that gave us the internet has found ways to get some net positive benefits from these tools to the brain.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000g3b6oz7kh0exh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            And despite the study’s significance, there are still many uncertainties about the relationships between various aspects of technology use and brain health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;h2 class="subheader inline-placeholder subheader" data-editable="text" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/subheader/instances/cm9h68686000w3b6ozprclta3@published" data-component-name="subheader" id="technology-use-and-the-brain" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
        Technology use and the brain
&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000h3b6o7nfxgqn8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            One of the study’s limitations is that it doesn’t have details on how people were using technological devices, experts said. As a result, it’s unclear whether participants were using computers or phones in ways that meaningfully exercised their brains, or what specific way may be most associated with cognitive protection.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000i3b6ouhqsvwwc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Lacking information on the amount of time technology was used means it’s also unknown whether there is harmful threshold or if only a little time is needed for cognitive benefits, Anderson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000j3b6oum902oqc@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            These questions are difficult “to try to answer, because the sheer volume of technology exposures that we have to navigate is so high,” Sachdev said. “To isolate one technology exposure and its effect is difficult, and to measure just a whole ecosystem of technology exposures and … their aggregate effect is also a challenge.”&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000k3b6oon6l8449@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, “the amount that we can extrapolate from this study towards future generations is very unclear, given the ubiquity of technology today that people are exposed to and have been exposed to from their birth,” Anderson said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000l3b6o8me0ru80@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “When you think about the kind of technology that this cohort would’ve been interacting with earlier in their lives, it’s a time when you had to really work to use technology,” Anderson added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000m3b6ootfk93x4@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Their brains were also already well formed, Benge said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000n3b6orv2dsrgv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The study may support the alternative to the digital dementia hypothesis, which is the cognitive reserve theory. The theory “contends that exposure to complex mental activities leads to better cognitive well-being in older age,” even in the face of age-related brain changes, according to the study.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000o3b6o5hhjl0zz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That technology may reduce risk of cognitive decline by helping us be more neurologically active is possible, Sachdev said. Technology use can also foster social connection in some instances, and social isolation has been linked &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/26/health/early-dementia-risk-study-wellness/index.html"&gt;with greater odds&lt;/a&gt; of developing dementia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000p3b6or62e68z9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            It’s also possible that older adults who are using technology may already have more active and resilient brains, explaining their engagement with technology.&lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;

            Inferences on best practices for technology use in consideration of cognitive health can’t be drawn from the study since it didn’t have specifics on participants’ use habits, experts said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000r3b6o2txpflh3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But “it does support that a healthy mix of activities is likely to be the most beneficial, and that fits with other literature on the topic as well,” Anderson said. “What this probably does more than anything else is provide some reassurance that there’s no association between at least moderate use of technology and cognitive decline.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Engaging in moderation is best, Sachdev said. And that should largely bring joy, genuine connection, creativity and intellectual stimulation to your life, experts said.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000t3b6op0jssclh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It should be productive in some way,” he added, and entertaining yourself can sometimes meet that requirement. But if you’re experiencing eye or neck strain from sitting in front of a screen, that’s a sign you’re using technology too much.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000u3b6orovmdicj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Too much of anything can be a bad thing,” Sachdev said. “Identifying the purpose and the duration and then executing along those lines is how we would advise for most topics.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9h685us000v3b6o49kn4mz9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Some older adults have avoided technology use, thinking it’s too difficult to learn. But Scullin and others have found even people with mild dementia can be trained to use such devices, he said. Though sometimes frustrating, the difficulty “is a reflection of the mental stimulation afforded through learning the device,” Scullin added.
    &lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;/div&gt;

If approved, it would become the first new class of antibiotic for the sexually transmitted infection in more than two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The pill, called gepotidacin, was &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-approves-first-new-antibiotic-utis-nearly-30-years-rcna197953" target="_blank"&gt;approved by the Food and Drug Administration in March&lt;/a&gt; to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infections in women and girls 12 and up — the most common type of infection in women. The drug is sold under the name Blujepa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="taboolaReadMoreBelow"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A new treatment option is important, experts say, because bacteria that commonly cause STIs are &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/superbug-infections-spiked-pandemics-first-wave-rcna37865" target="_blank"&gt;increasingly becoming resistant to the standard antibiotics&lt;/a&gt;, making treatment more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;There are an estimated 82 million new cases of gonorrhea globally each year, according to GSK. In the United States, rates of reported gonorrhea have increased 118% from 2009 to 2021, with more than 640,000 cases &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/sti-statistics/data-vis/table-trends.html" target="_blank"&gt;being reported&lt;/a&gt; to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Gonorrhea has developed resistance to nearly all the antibiotics used for its treatment, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;If left untreated, gonorrhea can &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4217-gonorrhea" target="_blank"&gt;lead to serious &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4217-gonorrhea" target="_blank"&gt;health &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4217-gonorrhea" target="_blank"&gt;complications&lt;/a&gt;, including swollen and painful joints, liver inflammation, and heart and brain damage. It can also increase the risk of infertility in women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Gepotidacin is part of a new class of antibiotics called triazaacenaphthylenes, which work by targeting two key enzymes that gonorrhea needs to copy itself and survive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In a Phase 3 clinical trial of more than 600 adults and teens, gepotidacin was shown to successfully treat about 92% of patients when taken twice daily, compared with about 91% in a group of patients who got a standard treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The most common side effect was gastrointestinal issues, with almost all reported being “mild or moderate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Crucially, the study authors wrote, the pill was effective against strains of gonorrhea bacteria that are resistant to existing antibiotics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="recommended-intersection-ref" data-activity-map="recommended-article-body-recommended" data-testid="recommended-wrapper"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;Dr. Sovrin Shah, an associate professor of urology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York who was not involved in the study, called the GSK pill “a welcome addition.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“Antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea is a public health concern,” Shah said. “The rate of STIs is significant in the U.S.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, said “we desperately need effective cures to combat gonorrhea,” but noted that widespread job cuts at the federal health agencies, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/health/cdc-sti-lab-gonorrhea.html" target="_blank"&gt;including to a lab that tracked STIs&lt;/a&gt;, could make it challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;“The recent closure of the CDC’s key STI lab — which helps us understand which antibiotics are still effective and when we need to engage new drugs like this — poses a significant new obstacle,” Harvey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;A spokesperson for GSK said the company plans to file approval with the FDA “in the coming months” with a regulatory decision expected in the second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;The company said it's seeking approval for gepotidacin as an alternative to first-line therapy when such treatment is inappropriate — such as when the patient is intolerant to the existing treatment or unwilling to use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="body-graf"&gt;In an editorial that accompanied the study, Magnus Unemo, director of the World Health Organization’s division that oversees gonorrhea, said GSK’s pill is “promising,” but added that challenges to keep gonorrhea as a treatable infection will continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="endmark body-graf"&gt;Unemo also stressed improved prevention, including the promotion of safe sex and condom use, early diagnosis and surveillance.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>NBC News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 14:58:35 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirgFBVV95cUxNMFN1S01BWnpGb1VPZkV0SFV3a2RpQ000WDNqQ2c1d052VzRFdnJveXJqdVh1UWVLVTF6bkw1eXhzU3ZvNWhqcUdtSERxbDVhbWlWMUtodTBkRDQzUXpDSzFuV2xON3JLallMNG82WWpBdC04Qy1fZm5TcnNqS0JlRF9hWkZqTy1rUW9TWndBbmttNUVWNWZTTktTZktRUUhRWjdSYlJyeXJSbjk4ZXfSAVZBVV95cUxPY2FJUVBpZzdUbjc5WVZPbGZzSWNBX09HUnlfSlhydDh1Wl9wYXlGS2tpOUpsYkVXVS1ZTXVqNkNlaFU5SGdpdUxraXB6WGw3S2gtaVQzQQ</guid></item><item><title>2025年世界南美锥虫病日-世界卫生组织（ WHO ） | World Chagas Disease Day 2025 - World Health Organization (WHO)</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia0FVX3lxTFBRR3ZRS3ZCSzE1YjQ4bTcwR1dPQ1A5MjM2dzZCZnhRNTV4Y295em9zOVB0OUpITVUwX0ZJdFg2em5HTWtEX2FZanhwZG9ZSmFIMnFxWnBjcXpYdkdhZFN4ZGZ6LWplOERLQTdj?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="sf-content-block content-block"&gt;

With &lt;strong&gt;7 million infections&lt;/strong&gt; globally and significant mortality rates, it poses a substantial public health threat. An estimated &lt;strong&gt;10,000 people die&lt;/strong&gt; from Chagas disease every year, and over &lt;strong&gt;100 million people are at risk &lt;/strong&gt;of acquiring the disease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Cases of drug-resistant gonorrhoea have increased rapidly in recent years, reducing the options for treatment. There is an urgent need for new treatments for gonorrhoea, with no new antibiotics found since the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Now a study has suggested that gepotidacin, an antibiotic used to treat urinary tract infections, could be used to fight the infection, ward off drug-resistant cases and improve patient experiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The phase-three results of the randomised control trial were &lt;a href="https://info.thelancet.com/e3t/Ctc/RF+113/cs6tF04/VWv4Gr7mW6dnW9lqkYB4d88qQW4dVnpw5vmd6PN5NMMmx3qgyTW8wLKSR6lZ3mtW2pkwl56Y-W3_W8KCLCf30JPJsW2TxwqZ5S82R-W7yB3yS1lw6nGW8C7rbR8fzhsWW14qklp64DLHCN8sfnYJl4Zy0W8cN2-_1qFvMjW4lB0GF5ChZN3V3NsPt116wn7W4ZcCCH7h_5zzW7-72jm2kwpk3W6SdbRL8ZQXcvN1vQgl44pWD9W1r_LKj46fz1qW4Qmd7N446bJxW8jhgY_7mQh97W5VFTWG2QLpWHW5qqYSW3X6BW9W68HCht5dpv-tVlwfsX6bbh-KVz8ygs7LKZkhVcjV-N8pNbKwW4yFSX78rGxr9W6QsSwj7c1ZTxW8Jn_cG4K6ycFW5glqsv2MmqRWW3yyMZj3-4JsKf2hmF5Y04" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;published in the Lancet journal&lt;/a&gt; and presented at the annual European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) conference in Vienna, Austria, on Monday. The trial was led by UK and US researchers and involved patients from the UK, US, Australia, Germany, Mexico and Spain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;In the study of 622 patients, researchers compared gepotidacin, taken as a pill, with the standard treatment of ceftriaxone, an injection, and azithromycin, a pill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;They found the new pill to be as effective as the standard treatment at tackling the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Crucially, gepotidacin was effective against strains of the gonorrhoea bacteria that are resistant to existing antibiotics. There were no treatment-related severe or serious side-effects for those treated with either medication, the Lancet reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The investigators said the new treatment could be an important tool in combatting the rise of gonorrhoea strains that are becoming resistant to the standard treatment. Additionally, treatment as a pill alone without the need for an injection would probably improve patient experiences and reduce the required healthcare resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The authors said gepotidacin “demonstrated non-inferiority to ceftriaxone plus azithromycin” and offered a “novel oral treatment option for uncomplicated urogenital gonorrhoea”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;They added: “Gepotidacin is a novel oral antibacterial treatment with the potential to become an alternative option for the treatment of gonococcal infections.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The authors also cautioned that the study looked primarily at urogenital gonorrhoea and that most of the patients were white men. Therefore more research was needed to see the impact of the treatment on gonorrhoea of the rectum and throat, and in women, children, and patients of other ethnicities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;Gonorrhoea is becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, with health officials previously warning it could be untreatable in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/article/2024/aug/15/gonorrhoea-getting-more-drug-resistant-and-may-become-untreatable" data-link-name="in body link"&gt;Last year officials in England issued a warning&lt;/a&gt; about a rise in super-strength cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;There were 85,000 cases of gonorrhoea diagnosed in England in 2023, the highest level since records began in 1918.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dcr-16w5gq9"&gt;The vast majority of cases can be treated.

Researchers have now uncovered how increased prolactin and reduced estrogen suppress specific neurons in the hypothalamus to boost appetite and conserve fat, meeting the energy demands of nursing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Removing estrogen receptor α (ERα) neurons in this brain region mimicked lactation, while reactivating them reversed these effects. This mechanism not only explains maternal metabolic shifts but may also hold clues for conditions like obesity, menopause, and hyperprolactinemia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brain-Hormone Link:&lt;/strong&gt; Estrogen receptor α neurons in the hypothalamus regulate prolactin and energy balance during lactation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metabolic Switch:&lt;/strong&gt; Decreased ERα activity leads to increased appetite and reduced fat-burning to sustain milk production.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clinical Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Findings could inform treatments for obesity, menopause, and high prolactin disorders.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Baylor College of Medicine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nursing poses major metabolic demands on mothers, to which they respond by eating more and saving energy to sustain milk production. There are significant hormonal changes during lactation, but how they lead to metabolic adaptations in nursing mothers remained unclear. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, which appeared in &lt;em&gt;Nature Metabolism, &lt;/em&gt;leading researchers at Baylor College of Medicine and Pennington Biomedical Research Center uncovered a mechanism that connects prolactin, estrogen, the brain and metabolic adaptations during lactation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108726"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a mom, baby and brain." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/lactation-estrogen-metabolism-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;This work opens exciting avenues for future research on neuroendocrine control of metabolism. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We worked with animal models to investigate how hormones and the brain work together to adapt to the metabolic demands nursing mothers face to sustain milk production,” said co-corresponding author Dr. Chunmei Wang, assistant professor of pediatrics at the USDA/ARS Children’s Nutrition Research Center at Baylor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Normally, estrogen helps control appetite and increases the body’s ability to burn fat, while prolactin does the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“During lactation, estrogen levels drop, and prolactin levels rise, leading to increased hunger and reduced fat-burning to compensate for extra energy demands posed by milk production and consumption,” said co-corresponding author Dr. Yanlin He, associate professor at Pennington Biomedical Research Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We found that brain cells called estrogen receptor α (ERα) neurons in a small area of the hypothalamus are significantly less active during lactation,” said co-first author Dr. Meng Yu, postdoctoral associate in the Wang lab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We showed that when ERα is deleted from these neurons, prolactin levels rise, and the animals increase their appetite and save energy by burning less fat. It was striking to see that just eliminating ERα in this tiny brain region was able to sustain such major metabolic consequences.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When ERα neurons were removed in non-lactating female mice, the animals showed high prolactin levels and lactation-like changes &lt;strong&gt;– &lt;/strong&gt;eating more and burning less fat. Reactivating these neurons in lactating mice reduced these effects, showing their role in controlling metabolism,” He said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am excited that we have discovered a novel mechanism for prolactin regulation,” Wang said. “We knew that prolactin is produced by pituitary cells, and estrogen can act on these cells to increase prolactin levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Here we found a novel role of estrogen in regulating prolactin levels – it activates ERα neurons in the hypothalamus, which in turn inhibits prolactin levels during lactation. These findings have potential clinical applications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The study sheds light on how the brain integrates hormonal signals to regulate energy balance, which could have broader implications for understanding hyperprolactinemia – high levels of prolactin in the blood – obesity, menopause and other conditions where prolactin or estrogen levels shift.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This work opens exciting avenues for future research on neuroendocrine control of metabolism,” He said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other contributors to this work include co-first authors Bing Feng and Jonathan C.

However, the underlying neuroendocrine mechanisms remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we find that oestrogen receptor alpha (ERα)-expressing neurons in the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH), specifically the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamus (vlVMH), are suppressed during lactation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deletion of ERα from MBH neurons in virgin female mice induces metabolic phenotypes characteristic of lactation, including hyperprolactinemia, hyperphagia and suppressed BAT thermogenesis. By contrast, activation of ERα&lt;sup&gt;vlVMH&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in lactating mice attenuates these phenotypes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, our study reveals an inhibitory effect of E2–ERα&lt;sup&gt;vlVMH&lt;/sup&gt; signalling on PRL production, which is suppressed during lactation to sustain hyperprolactinemia and metabolic adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 14:25:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiZ0FVX3lxTE83amxQRklJQjJQTUw4bFh1UmY0dFYyeW4yN3U0R2VoeC1pbWdvZ1RXOWtTWU1sUjRuTmNJbWtlUHNiTFpzOVZsVi00MmNzTEtoWGNBRHplNnJBSmZ4TTFzRTF6bDM4bWM</guid></item><item><title>新冠肺炎疫情是否正在重写老龄化规则？脑衰退警报医生-《华尔街日报》 | Is Covid Rewriting the Rules of Aging?

                                        Looking for ways to keep the brain healthy in later life? A new study has identified 17 risk factors tied to three age-related brain diseases—all of which can be altered through behavioral changes. Researchers at Mass General Brigham reviewed meta-analyses of risk factors associated with stroke, dementia, and late-life depression, finding 17 modifiable factors shared by at least two of the diseases, per the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2025/04/14/stroke-dementia-depression-kidney-disease/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These include alcohol, blood pressure, blood glucose levels, body mass index, cholesterol, diet, hearing loss, kidney function, pain, physical activity, sleep, social engagement, smoking, and stress.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                    
                                
                                
                            &lt;/div&gt;

                            
                            
                            
                            
                            
                                &lt;div id="divStoryBodyBelow"&gt;
                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Researchers then predicted the impact each risk factor had on quality of life and mortality. High blood pressure and severe kidney disease had the greatest negative impact, while engagement in physical activity and cognitive leisure activities, like reading or puzzles, appeared best for lowering risk, the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; reports. As all 17 factors can be controlled through healthy behaviors, "this means there are real opportunities for prevention," Dr. Sanjula Singh, principal investigator at MGH's Brain Care Labs and lead author of the study published this month in the &lt;a href="https://jnnp.bmj.com/content/early/2025/03/21/jnnp-2024-334925"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, tells &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/health/stroke-dementia-depression-share-17-preventable-risk-factors"&gt;Fox News&lt;/a&gt;.
                                    &lt;/p&gt;
                                

                                
                                    &lt;p class="storyParagraph"&gt;
                                        Taken as a whole, the 17 risk factors can seem overwhelming so it's best to look at them as a "menu of options," says Singh. "Whether it's managing your blood pressure, staying physically active, eating well or maintaining social connections, small changes in your daily routine can help you take better care of your brain over time." She notes "one to three small, realistic changes can already make a meaningful difference" and "progress in one area often supports progress in others" since many of the risk factors are interconnected. More physical activity, for example, may lower blood pressure and improve sleep at the same time.  (More &lt;a href="/tag/4072/1/brain.html"&gt;brain&lt;/a&gt; stories.)

This adaptive behavior is controlled by a mechanosensitive protein channel called PIEZO1, which detects mechanical stress and triggers a shift in how the cell’s internal motors generate movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When navigating confined environments, PIEZO1 activates a calcium signal that pushes the nucleus forward, allowing neurons to squeeze through narrow spaces. These findings challenge previous beliefs about fixed migration types and may have implications for treating brain injury and cancer metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PIEZO1 Role:&lt;/strong&gt; Neurons use the mechanosensitive protein PIEZO1 to detect mechanical stress and adapt their migration mode.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mode Switching:&lt;/strong&gt; Neurons pull themselves forward on flat surfaces but push through confined spaces.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Implications:&lt;/strong&gt; Insights could help enhance neuron repair after brain injury and improve understanding of cancer metastasis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Kindai University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the developing brain, neurons must navigate through complex and often crowded tissue to reach their final destinations—this process is crucial for proper brain formation and function. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to how we might choose different methods of locomotion depending on terrain, neurons apparently employ distinct migration strategies based on various factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108714"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows a neuron." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/neuron-movement-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;The key to this adaptive behavior is a mechanosensitive protein channel called PIEZO1, which detects mechanical stress when neurons attempt to pass through confined spaces. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;More specifically, scientists have observed different migration mechanisms across different neuron types. For example, migrating forebrain interneurons use myosin to exert a pushing force on the nucleus, whereas cerebellar granule neurons in culture dishes use actomyosin to generate a traction force that pulls the nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the precise mechanisms governing these migration modes remain underexplored, particularly how neurons switch strategies in response to environmental changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent study, a research team led by Lecturer Naotaka Nakazawa of the Department of Energy and Materials, Faculty of Science and Engineering, Kindai University, Japan, has discovered that neurons can switch between different migration modes depending on whether they are moving across an unencumbered flat surface or squeezing through confined three-dimensional spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their paper, which was made available online on March 6, 2025, reveals a sophisticated mechanosensing mechanism that allows neurons to adapt their movement strategy to navigate the complex architecture of the developing brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study was co-authored by Mineko Kengaku of Kyoto University, Gianluca Grenci of the National University of Singapore, Yoshitaka Kameko of Shibaura Institute of Technology, and Keiko Nonomura of Kyoto University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This paper was made available online on March 6, 2025, and was published in Volume 44, Issue 3 of &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt; on March 25, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In previous observations, we noticed that the nucleus in migrating neurons was significantly deformed in brain tissue. At the same time, migrating neurons sometimes exhibited dynamics different from those reported,” explains Nakazawa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We speculated that such irregular dynamics in migrating neurons might be activated as they pass through confined spaces in brain tissue, because the nucleus is deformed when the cell receives external mechanical stress.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using innovative techniques including microfluidic devices, computer simulations, and live imaging of brain cells and tissues, the researchers observed the migration of cerebellar granule neurons—a type of neuron found in the cerebellum—in both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2D cultures, the protein complex responsible for movement—actomyosin—concentrates at the front of the migrating neuron, pulling the cell forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when the same neurons encounter confined 3D spaces, they redistribute this machinery to the back of the cell, creating a pushing force that helps squeeze the cell through tight spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to this adaptive behavior is a mechanosensitive protein channel called PIEZO1, which detects mechanical stress when neurons attempt to pass through confined spaces. When activated, PIEZO1 triggers calcium influx into the cell, initiating a signaling cascade that relocates the cell’s motor proteins to the rear membrane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This repositioning generates contractile forces that help propel the cell forward through narrow passages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers confirmed the critical role of PIEZO1 by demonstrating that neurons lacking this protein could migrate normally in unconfined environments but struggled significantly when navigating confined spaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings challenge previous assumptions that different types of neurons inherently use different migration strategies, suggesting instead that neurons possess the ability to adapt their movement mechanisms based on their immediate surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of providing deep insights into important biological aspects of neuronal migration, the findings of this study could have relevant medical implications as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When the brain is damaged, neuronal precursors called neuroblasts migrate to the lesion,” says Nakazawa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“In the future, our findings may help develop therapeutic techniques to restore brain function by enhancing neuronal migration in the confined spaces of brain tissue.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worth noting is that the mechanisms underlying cell migration are fundamental to many biological processes beyond the brain, including embryonic development, immune responses, and cancer metastasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cancer cells, for instance, must navigate through various tissue environments during metastasis, potentially employing similar adaptive strategies to neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding how cells sense and respond to physical constraints could therefore inform new approaches to diagnosing and treating conditions ranging from developmental disorders to metastatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let us hope more studies in this intriguing field help us clarify how neurons and other cell types find their way within our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;About this neurodevelopment research news&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cfa4a0a7a08fa4a6a1abaea6e1aeace1a5bf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Tamaki Kasuya&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://kindai.ac.jp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Kindai University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contact: &lt;/strong&gt;Tamaki Kasuya – Kindai University&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Image: &lt;/strong&gt;The image is credited to Neuroscience News&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Research: &lt;/strong&gt;Open access.&lt;br&gt;“&lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2025.115405" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;PIEZO1-dependent mode switch of neuronal migration in heterogeneous microenvironments in the developing brain&lt;/a&gt;” by Naotaka Nakazawa et al. &lt;em&gt;Cell Reports&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-pale-cyan-blue-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-pale-cyan-blue-background-color has-background"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abstract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PIEZO1-dependent mode switch of neuronal migration in heterogeneous microenvironments in the developing brain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The migration of newborn neurons is essential for brain morphogenesis and circuit formation, yet controversy exists regarding how neurons generate the driving force against strong mechanical stresses in crowded neural tissues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that cerebellar granule neurons employ a mechanosensing mechanism to switch the driving forces to maneuver in irregular brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In two-dimensional (2D) cultures, actomyosin is enriched in the leading process, exerting traction force on the cell soma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In tissue or 3D confinement, however, actomyosin concentrates at the posterior cell membrane, generating contractile forces that assist passage through narrow spaces, working alongside the traction force in the leading process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 3D migration is initiated by the activation of a mechanosensitive channel, PIEZO1. PIEZO1-induced calcium influx in the soma triggers the PKC-ezrin cascade, which recruits actomyosin and transmits its contractile force to the posterior plasma membrane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus, migrating neurons adapt their motility modes in distinct extracellular environments in the developing brain.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 12:49:09 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE1pdVpLTzZNdnpSd0E5RnNKYVZDTldQVU5VbDE3eXRmRXZjcFpMN1AxSDl6bnRtLXU1NlhmOEhQT1dRNUVYSS1CZ1VneXgwMDdTTlJQRVNXU1pOanBmREFCa3lBQi1VZWpWZG42Y2lWNzA3SjhqOUE</guid></item><item><title>他已经决定要死了。陌生人向他祈祷—和晚餐邀请-今日美国 | He’s decided to die.

I am bipolar, and I moved to the Netherlands to legally end my life. I’m not special, I’m just ready.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/okuntakinte/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Awuah-Darko&lt;/a&gt;, a 28-year-old British-Ghanaian artist, has documented his battle with &lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2023/11/30/what-is-bipolar-disorder/71636701007/#:~:text=That's%20about%2011.3%20million%20people,day%2Dto%2Dday%20activities." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;treatment-resistant bipolar disorder&lt;/a&gt; for years. After contemplating &lt;a href="/story/news/nation/2025/03/31/terri-schiavo-death-after-20-years/82696234007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;assisted dying&lt;/a&gt; for five years, he is now pursuing the treatment under the public eye on grounds of mental suffering. In the Netherlands, &lt;a href="https://www.government.nl/topics/euthanasia" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;assisted euthanasia for psychiatric conditions is legal&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with a lengthy approval process. His announcement has been met with mixed reactions — curiosity, horror, sympathy, prayers, confessions of shared struggles and even pleas to change his mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“What usually happens when you cry on the internet is that people bully you and create memes from your ugly crying,” he says from Amsterdam, over the phone in late March. “To my shock and a bit of my bemusement, that didn't happen to me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Amid accusations of “&lt;a href="/story/life/health-wellness/2024/07/30/suicide-prevention-dad-story-website-teen-phone/74507915007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|e|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;romanticizing suicide&lt;/a&gt;,” the most shocking response was not the criticism or praise — but a dinner invitation. Hundreds of strangers invited Awuah-Darko to share a meal, inspiring him to start a worldwide tour of dinners with strangers, which he has coined the "Last Supper Project." As he awaits a decision on his request for euthanasia, he’s had 93 dinners and received over 4,000 invitations. He's traveled to Paris, Milan, Brussels and Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"Dinner is a very, if not the most, intimate and intentional part of anyone's day," he says. "For me, that has just been a special way of fostering remarkable relationships and connections during the time I have left."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;One of his most impactful dinners was with a Surinamese mother who struggled with suicidal ideation and postpartum depression. She invited her kids to the table for a guided discussion over homemade Surinamese sourdough soup. At his 30th dinner, he met his friend Emmanual, who suffers from C-PTSD and has been scheduled to die on July 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Awuah-Darko, who has attempted suicide in the past, calls himself “just one person among millions” struggling with bipolar disorder and chronic suicidality — but he understands the power of social media to amplify a story. “If people choose to see it as romanticizing, I think that more reflects on them,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But under the watchful eyes of over 560,000 Instagram followers, Awuah-Darko undoubtedly has an impact. Whether that is “good” or “bad” is still debated, and bioethicists and mental health experts say the answer may lie in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/12/USAT/83059483007-img-5052.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=516&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/12/USAT/83059483007-img-5052.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;height=1032&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt="Awuah-Darko has had 93 dinners and counting with strangers through the 'Last Supper Project'"&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption="Awuah-Darko has had 93 dinners and counting with strangers through the 'Last Supper Project'" data-c-credit="Joseph Awuah-Darko"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;'People should be able to talk about uncomfortable, inconvenient things'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Assisted dying for psychiatric conditions is a complicated ethical dilemma with many “right” answers, according to bioethicists. While it’s imperative to spark open conversations around mental health and suicide, mental health experts caution that romanticization can ignite contagion suicide (also known as “copycat suicides” or the “Werther effect”). In contrast, the "Papegeno effect" is the effect that mass media can have by presenting positive examples of hope and non-suicide alternatives to crises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“We know from studies that this can be a real risk, but also protective for some,” says Manuel Trachsel, a bio and medical ethics professor at the University of Basel in Switzerland who co-authored a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9306695/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;2022 study&lt;/a&gt; on assisted dying for severe and persistent mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;As for the mixed reactions to Awuah-Darko — including those praying for him to change his mind — some people “predominantly fear the Wether effect, and others see the chance of the Papageno effect,” Trachsel says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nami.org/about-nami/who-we-are/meet-our-leadership/ken-duckworth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Ken Duckworth&lt;/a&gt;, a triple board-certified psychiatrist and the Chief Medical Officer at the National Alliance for Mental Illness (NAMI), affirms that talking about suicide &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24998511/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;will not put the idea into people’s heads&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it can &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735818301351" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;improve treatment-seeking behaviors&lt;/a&gt;. But social media, he says, gets complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I can't speak to how much he's suffering, and that is his decision. But making it such a public event does strike me as problematic,” says Duckworth. He worries that people considering suicide may fall susceptible to the contagion effect if they see Awuah-Darko as “cool” or “inspirational."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But Awuah-Darko doesn’t think he’s romanticizing suicide, nor does he want to. Rather, he wants to avoid people not talking about it at all. Still, he knows that bringing attention to assisted suicide doesn’t come without criticism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“My biggest curse, and I guess blessing sometimes, is my awareness of all this, and yet still choosing to do it,” he says. “I think people should be able to talk about uncomfortable, inconvenient things without being accused of romanticizing it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Awuah-Darko is not interested in people who are "more interested in playing offense, politics and collective outrage" than having a nuanced conversation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;He continues, “I think what people inadvertently say when they speak about their discomfort with seeing me talk about the dignity of medically assisted death is that they would rather I not talk about it, which means to continue this dangerously culpable culture of people ending their lives in private and in shame."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="gnt_em gnt_em_img gnt_em_img__inset"&gt;&lt;img class="gnt_em_img_i" fetchpriority="high" data-g-r="lazy" data-gl-src="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/12/USAT/83059485007-img-8583.jpg?width=300&amp;amp;height=376&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp" data-gl-srcset="/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/12/USAT/83059485007-img-8583.jpg?width=600&amp;amp;height=752&amp;amp;fit=crop&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp 2x" decoding="async" alt='In Ghana, Awuah-Darko says food is "spiritual and remarkably therapeutic."'&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_em_img_ccw gnt_em_img_ccw__cap gnt_em_img_ccw__crd" data-c-caption='In Ghana, Awuah-Darko says food is "spiritual and remarkably therapeutic."' data-c-credit="Joseph Awuah-Darko"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;The ethics of assisted dying versus evidence that suicide is preventable&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Trachsel says an autonomy-based ethical argument for assisted suicide for psychiatric conditions is that “every person has the right to determine the time and circumstances of their death” and we should not “discriminate” between those with psychiatric disorders and persons with somatic diseases.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;However, for mood disorders, such as bipolar disorder, suicidal ideation can be a transient state, according to Duckworth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“The mood states are inherently complicated. Helplessness and hopelessness are criteria of depression. Poor judgment and impulsivity are features of mania,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Awauh-Darko, who lives with chronic suicidality, struggles to navigate oscillations between manic productivity and deep lows, like many individuals with bipolar disorder, he says. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at age 16, but doesn't remember a time without its symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;"You still essentially fear, or are almost terrified of joy, because you know that a deep depression beckons right around the corner," he says. "You do get fatigued of constantly trying to be okay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.iasp.info/our_team/lars-mehlum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;Lars Mehlum&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of psychiatry and suicidology, believes that chronic suicidality is still treatable and that doctors too often “give up” on patients who are regarded as untreatable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“People who are advocating for euthanasia look at it as some sort of linear process. It's not. It's very transactional and also volatile,” says Mehlum, who is also the founding director of the National Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention at the University of Oslo Institute of Clinical Medicine. He co-authored a &lt;a href="https://bpded.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40479-020-00131-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;2020 study&lt;/a&gt; on assisted suicide for people with personality disorders. “For example, people who are suicidal can very much be deeply suicidal in the moment. But in extreme cases, you can change suicidality within five minutes.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Duckworth’s research also illustrates that suicide is preventable — a rigorously studied belief shared by prominent mental health organizations like &lt;a href="https://988lifeline.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;988 Lifeline&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://988lifeline.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;American Foundation for Suicide Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, according to their mission statements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;When working on NAMI’s book, “&lt;a href="https://www.nami.org/support-education/publications-reports/you-are-not-alone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;You Are Not Alone: The NAMI Guide to Navigating Mental Health&lt;/a&gt;,” he interviewed 130 people, many of whom were suicidal in their 20s, but not in their 30s or 40s. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“The 20s are a difficult time in general, in life and in mental health conditions,” he explains. Finding companionship and joining peer support groups, along with the development of innovative treatments, were protective factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Mehlum says it can take 20 years for &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3241518/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;research evidence to reach clinical practice&lt;/a&gt;. New treatments are &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39427446/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;continuously studied&lt;/a&gt;. Prozac, one of the most commonly prescribed antidepressants, was developed in the 1970s, but didn’t become widely available until 1988. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Duckworth argues that Awuah-Darko is pursuing one of his recommended treatments — regardless of intention — through the “Last Supper Project” by building strong social connections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;In the United States and Awuah-Darko’s home of London, assisted death for mental health suffering is illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2"&gt;'Life has surprised me'&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Awuah-Darko speaks with poise and intention, but he is self-aware of this juxtaposition. Some may see his apparent put-togetherness as contradictory to his suffering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“While I may sound sanitized, composed and be able to structure sentences on this phone call, it doesn't mean that I'm not masking or that I'm not having to navigate complex emotions,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;He also says he couldn’t care less about being profiled in any capacity, at least not for personal fame. Rather, Awuah-Darko wants his story to reach people, whether through Instagram or this article, who feel alone in their battles, even if that comes with backlash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I have gotten messages and letters, thousands of which have spoken to how liberating people find my ability to speak so openly about what I'm going through,” he says. “And that's worth it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;Society extends more grace in hindsight, he says. Instagram comment sections are flooded with hearts and flowers; the media memorializes a tragedy. “But when someone chooses to confront it as a living person, there tends to be vitriol,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;On average, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9251055/" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;5% of people&lt;/a&gt; who apply for assisted death for psychiatric conditions in the Netherlands are approved. Between 2012 and 2021, &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2828937#:~:text=Findings%20In%20this%20cohort%20study,suicide%20during%20the%20application%20process." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;only 3% of applicants younger than 24&lt;/a&gt; died by assisted suicide on a mental health basis; 47% of applications were retracted and 45% were rejected. In 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.euthanasiecommissie.nl/actueel/nieuws/2025/03/24/tien-procent-meer-meldingen-euthanasie-in-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" data-t-l=":b|z|k|${u}" class="gnt_ar_b_a"&gt;219 out of 9,958 euthanasia deaths&lt;/a&gt; were for psychiatric reasons, and the total deaths increased by 10% compared to 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“I hope I get approved,” Awuah-Darko says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;However, when asked if he will change his mind, his honest answer is, "I don't know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="gnt_ar_b_p"&gt;“Life has surprised me. I did not expect to be invited to dinner by thousands of people.

Looking back at her decision to get jabbed, Kelly now regrets getting the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I just had my annual physical and it's still testing positive for autoimmune," the 54-year-old, told the Daily Mail, adding, "I really, really regret having gotten the vaccine," said the popular host of the Megyn Kelly Show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explaining her reasons for getting vaccinated, Kelly said she felt compelled to take the shots because vaccination proof was essential to go out during the pandemic in New York City, where she was living at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly first spoke about her autoimmune condition in her podcast - The Megyn Kelly Show, in February. While chatting with Dr. Aseem Malhotra, a British Covid vaccine skeptic, she told him that while the doctors couldn't find out what the condition was exactly, they told her it could have been caused by the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I asked the rheumatologist if it could be linked to the Pfizer vaccine and booster, and she said, ‘Yes, and you’re not the only patient I have who’s had this sequence of events," she said in her podcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="13"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is post-vaccination syndrome?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kelly isn't the only person left with a mystery condition linked to Covid vaccine. Yale researchers found out that several other people were left with chronic symptoms months and years after getting the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the research scientists examined blood samples from 42 study participants who experienced symptoms of post-vaccination syndrome (PVS) and 22 who did not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with PVS had lower levels of two types of white blood cells. Additionally, people with PVS who had never contracted Covid also had lower levels of antibodies against the virus. The symptoms of PVS include excessive fatigue, exercise intolerance, brain fog, insomnia and dizziness, as per researchers. These developed within days of taking vaccine and worsened over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is Covid-19 vaccination linked to autoimmunity?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autoimmunity has been linked to Covid-19 vaccination since the beginning of the pandemic. In a &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9399140/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published in the Journal of Autoimmunity, six patients experienced either a relapse of a pre-existing autoimmune disease or developed a new autoimmune or autoinflammatory condition following immunization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A systematic review of 464 studies up to August 1, 2022, documented 928 such cases. The majority of affected individuals were women (53.6%) with a median age of 48 years and symptoms typically began around eight days after vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New-onset autoimmune conditions were more common, accounting for 81.5% of cases, with immune thrombocytopenia, myocarditis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome being the most frequently reported. In contrast, 18.5% experienced relapses of existing conditions, most often immune thrombocytopenia, psoriasis, IgA nephropathy, and systemic lupus erythematosus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A large-scale, nationwide &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-50656-8" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;cohort study&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; published in Nature Communications involving over 9 million individuals in South Korea investigated the long-term association between mRNA-based Covid -19 vaccination and the development of autoimmune connective tissue diseases (AI-CTDs) over a one-year period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results showed that mRNA vaccination was not associated with an increased risk for most AI-CTDs, including alopecia areata, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and vitiligo, among others. However, a modestly increased risk was observed for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), particularly in individuals who received the BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech) vaccine, as well as in those with a prior Covid-19 diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;'Pissed off about the whole thing'&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no question people have been hurt and even killed,' said Kelly. "I, for one, have learned a ton, but remain pissed off about how the whole thing was handled."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an unfortunate thing. You can't undo the past," Kelly told Daily Mail, accepting that there have been 'worse' outcomes experienced by other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But we were lied to," she continued, adding, "It was not an informed assumption of the risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Other side effects of Covid vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They include life-threatening conditions like anaphylaxis.

While in neurons, excess alpha-synuclein leads to cell death, in melanoma cells it enables uncontrolled growth by recruiting repair proteins to DNA breaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This dual role highlights the complex nature of alpha-synuclein and suggests new therapeutic targets for both diseases. Researchers now aim to modulate this protein’s function to either curb cancer growth or restore protective DNA repair in neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Facts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dual Role of Alpha-Synuclein:&lt;/strong&gt; In Parkinson’s, it exits the nucleus and forms harmful clumps; in melanoma, it remains in the nucleus and over-repairs DNA.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancer Mechanism:&lt;/strong&gt; In melanoma cells, alpha-synuclein boosts the recruitment of repair protein 53BP1, promoting cell survival and proliferation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Therapeutic Potential:&lt;/strong&gt; Drugs that adjust alpha-synuclein function could offer new treatments for both Parkinson’s disease and melanoma.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Source: &lt;/strong&gt;Oregon Health and Science University&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A small protein involved in neurodegeneration leading to Parkinson’s disease also drives a type of skin cancer known as melanoma, new research led by Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University finds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;, suggests new avenues for drug development to reduce the risk of developing &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; Parkinson’s and skin cancer by targeting the alpha-synuclein protein, which appears to have a critical role in regulating cellular functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;picture fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="wp-image-108710"&gt; &lt;source type="image/webp" srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience.jpg.webp 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience-300x200.jpg.webp 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience-770x513.jpg.webp 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg.webp 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience-370x247.jpg.webp 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience-293x195.jpg.webp 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience-150x100.jpg.webp 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt;&lt;/source&gt; &lt;img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience.jpg" alt="This shows DNA." srcset="https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience.jpg 1200w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience-300x200.jpg 300w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience-770x513.jpg 770w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience-1155x770.jpg 1155w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience-370x247.jpg 370w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience-293x195.jpg 293w, https://neurosciencenews.com/files/2025/04/parkinsons-cancer-genetics-neuroscience-150x100.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"&gt; &lt;/picture&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;In melanoma, researchers found that alpha-synuclein does its job too well — allowing cells to proliferate uncontrollably as cancer. Credit: Neuroscience News&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Developing drugs that target alpha-synuclein may be useful in both diseases,” said senior author Vivek Unni, M.D., Ph.D., an associate professor of neurology in the OHSU School of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding builds on a previous discovery by Unni and colleagues published in 2019 that found alpha-synuclein helps to perform a critical function by repairing double strand breaks in the DNA of brain cells known as neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They believe this function is crucial in preventing cell death, which occurs when alpha-synuclein exits the cell’s nucleus and instead forms clumps known as Lewy bodies in Parkinson’s and Lewy body dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study, conducted in melanoma cells and led by OHSU M.D./Ph.D. student Moriah Arnold, B.A., Ph.D., finds the opposite effect in respect to melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In melanoma, researchers found that alpha-synuclein does its job too well — allowing cells to proliferate uncontrollably as cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Skin cells are constantly growing and dying and being replaced. That’s normal,” Unni said. “The problem comes when the cells that should be dying don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that alpha-synuclein in melanomas don’t seem to leave the nucleus and aggregate as they do with neurons in Parkinson’s. Instead, the opposite occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They increase in the nucleus and perform their function too well within the nucleolus of each melanoma cell’s nucleus: identifying double strand breaks in DNA and then recruiting a different type of protein, known as &lt;em&gt;53BP1&lt;/em&gt;, to repair them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This can lead to runaway cellular replication — cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Counterintuitively, Unni said, a similar increase in alpha-synuclein leads to cellular &lt;em&gt;death&lt;/em&gt; in Parkinson’s. Why? In neurons as opposed to skin cells, an overabundance of alpha-synuclein seems to pull them out of the cell’s nucleus into clusters forming in the cytoplasm surrounding the nucleus, Unni said. This, in turn, leads to cellular death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A neuron has to live the whole life of a person,” Unni said. “When alpha-synuclein reaches a tipping point of abundance, it can no longer perform its normal function and the neuron dies.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study suggests it may be possible to develop a drug that lowers the level of alpha-synuclein or modulates its function to treat melanoma, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, he said his research is now exploring other avenues to boost the recruitment of the binding protein &lt;em&gt;53BP1&lt;/em&gt; to replace the function of alpha-synuclein as a possible treatment for Parkinson’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This provides a framework for understanding the link between (Parkinson’s disease) and melanoma, and offers potential therapeutic targets in melanoma that are focused on reducing aSyn-mediated nucleolar double strand break repair,” the authors conclude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Funding: &lt;/strong&gt;Research was supported by the National Institute on Aging, National Institute of Neurological Disorders &amp;amp; Stroke, and National Cancer Center, of the National Institutes of Health, Awards F30AG082406, R01NS102227, P30NS061800 and P30CA065823; the Danish Cancer Society award R302-A17506; the Melanoma Research Alliance, the Michael J.

We now show that αSyn is preferentially enriched within the nucleolus in melanoma, where it colocalizes with DNA damage markers and DSBs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inducing DSBs specifically within nucleolar ribosomal DNA (rDNA) increases αSyn levels near sites of damage. αSyn knockout increases DNA damage within the nucleolus at baseline, after specific rDNA DSB induction, and prolongs the rate of recovery from this induced damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;αSyn is important downstream of ataxia-telangiectasia–mutated signaling to facilitate MDC1-mediated 53BP1 recruitment to DSBs, reducing micronuclei formation and promoting cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="clear"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Neuroscience News</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 12:25:37 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiakFVX3lxTFA2S1lJZjRham9rdER2ckRvbUZiODFDNGxrWTNZTkhCUDFjN3hiRWZXNHF5YlZFVlREaC1DZ0ZDQmgxaGNOWnA4aG9OSGFxOXR0ejFkbEtQeGFsYmI2cS03UTFmTzlySWtESWc</guid></item><item><title>研究发现，儿童虐待与类风湿性关节炎和银屑病的高风险有关- PsyPost | Childhood maltreatment linked to higher risk of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, study finds - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiuwFBVV95cUxOaktfdFdmbzVsN1BtSFd2aEk2ZGU3UmdfQ0xYLWFaSHMyR29xSTkyZTUteENtUFJ3UnJFSHlCRmk3Q2N6d1N3b1BzcXd2OHh1V0wzM2RvcXJzTWIzVjVlaVg3LVdEVWNJbzc5RHk0Ry0tdlFkczhfeGJkYWE2X28zRF8yQnd0N0ZVOVVvOTBSYlBxenJBcUFmWTg5SzFId1VSSnZkcGhxSHpVbkd3UkNhTEZiRlhwSUY1VlRz?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e40493" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Heliyon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; has found that people who experienced abuse, neglect, or domestic abuse during childhood have a significantly higher risk of developing certain chronic immune disorders later in life—specifically, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. The association was particularly strong among women, raising questions about how early life adversity may shape lifelong health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers aimed to investigate how early exposure to abuse might relate to the development of immune-mediated inflammatory disorders, a group of chronic illnesses that includes rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, and inflammatory bowel diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While previous studies have hinted at a connection between early trauma and immune disorders, most of the research has relied on self-reported surveys or hospital records, often with small sample sizes. The current study sought to overcome these limitations by analyzing data from a large, representative sample using electronic health records from primary care practices in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a public health researcher and clinician, I’ve long been interested in how early life adversity shapes long-term health outcomes,” said study author &lt;a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/applied-health/chandan-joht" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Joht Singh Chandan&lt;/a&gt;, a clinical professor of public health at the University of Birmingham. “Childhood maltreatment is a widespread yet under-acknowledged public health issue. We know it’s linked to mental health and cardiovascular outcomes, but its relationship with chronic immune diseases has been less explored, particularly in the UK context. This study aimed to fill that gap using robust, large-scale primary care data.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers used the IQVIA Medical Research Database, which includes de-identified electronic health records from general practices across the United Kingdom. These records contain clinical notes, diagnoses, and other medical data, including childhood maltreatment codes recorded by general practitioners. The study period covered over two decades, from January 1995 to January 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers identified 256,130 individuals with a documented history of childhood maltreatment before age 18 and matched them with 712,478 unexposed individuals based on age, sex, socioeconomic deprivation, and medical practice. Maltreatment was identified using a broad set of clinical codes, capturing both confirmed instances and concerns about potential abuse or neglect. Participants were followed over time to see whether they developed one of six chronic immune disorders: rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, coeliac disease, multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed that people exposed to childhood maltreatment had a 39% higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis and a 16% higher risk of developing psoriasis compared to those without such exposure. These associations held even after adjusting for factors such as age, sex, and socioeconomic status. Notably, the increased risk was more pronounced in women. For example, women who had experienced childhood maltreatment were 54% more likely to be diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, while the increase in risk for men was not statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Experiences of childhood maltreatment can have enduring effects on physical health, not just mental wellbeing,” Chandan told PsyPost. “Our findings suggest that individuals exposed to maltreatment are at increased risk of developing conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. This reinforces the need for early prevention and support, and highlights the long arm of early trauma on the immune system.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the study did not find statistically significant differences in the risk of developing multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or inflammatory bowel disease. Interestingly, those exposed to childhood maltreatment were found to be at a lower risk of developing celiac disease. The reasons for this unexpected result are unclear, but researchers speculated that differences in healthcare access, disease detection, or dietary factors may play a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were surprised to find a lower risk of celiac disease among those exposed to childhood maltreatment,” Chandan said. “While we don’t believe maltreatment is protective, this may reflect underdiagnosis or health inequalities, where symptoms are overlooked or access to care is limited. It highlights the complex intersection of trauma, healthcare access, and disease presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The authors also conducted several sensitivity analyses to strengthen their findings. When restricting the analysis to patients whose medical records contained direct evidence of maltreatment—as opposed to indirect concerns—the associations with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis were even stronger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several possible explanations for the link between childhood maltreatment and these diseases. One is that early life stress may interfere with the development of the body’s stress regulation and immune systems, leading to chronic inflammation. Studies have shown that people exposed to maltreatment often have elevated levels of inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein, which are also found in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Other behavioral factors, such as higher rates of smoking, alcohol use, and obesity among those with a history of maltreatment, may also contribute to an elevated risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its strengths, the study has important limitations. The analysis relied on medical records, which may underreport or misclassify cases of childhood maltreatment. The coding system used had high specificity but relatively low sensitivity, meaning that many cases likely went undetected. Additionally, information on potentially important confounding factors such as alcohol use, ethnicity, education, and family history was often missing or inconsistently recorded. The researchers also noted that follow-up time was shorter in the exposed group, which could affect estimates of long-term disease risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another limitation concerns the outcomes themselves. Although rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis are well captured in general practice records, the recording of other immune disorders like lupus and multiple sclerosis may be less consistent, and the shorter follow-up period may not have been long enough to detect these conditions, which often develop later in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our study relies on clinical records, so it’s limited by how often and accurately GPs record maltreatment and IMID diagnoses,” Chandan noted. “There’s also the possibility of underreporting in both exposure and outcomes. Additionally, while we adjusted for some confounders like deprivation, there may be unmeasured factors—like family history or environmental exposures—that influence risk.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the study’s findings suggest that childhood maltreatment may play a more significant role in the development of certain immune-mediated conditions than previously understood. Because both childhood adversity and immune disorders are common in the population, even a modest increase in risk translates into a meaningful public health concern. The authors emphasize that early intervention and prevention efforts should not only focus on psychological outcomes but also consider the long-term physical health consequences of early life trauma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Future research will be needed to explore how different types and severities of maltreatment affect disease risk, whether there is a dose-response relationship, and which biological pathways are involved. Researchers are particularly interested in whether chronic stress-induced inflammation could be a key mechanism. Expanding these investigations to other countries and healthcare systems will also help determine how generalizable the findings are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We hope to explore how different types, severities, and timings of childhood maltreatment influence physical health outcomes, including whether there’s a dose-response relationship,” Chandan explained. “We’re also keen to understand the biological mechanisms — particularly the role of chronic inflammation — and to inform policy around early intervention and trauma-informed care.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“While this study adds to the evidence that childhood adversity has lasting health impacts, it’s also a call to action. Preventing maltreatment and supporting survivors isn’t just a moral or legal obligation — it’s a public health priority. Integrating this knowledge into routine clinical care could help mitigate long-term harm.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e40493" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;The risk of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases following exposure to childhood maltreatment: A retrospective cohort study using UK primary care data&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Liam Snook, Sonica Minhas, Vrinda Nadda, Ben Hammond, Krishna M.

                Reverend Billiance Chondwe of the Somone Community Center, a branch of the Pentecostal Holiness Church in Zambia, says that many in his congregation have fallen ill since late January when cuts to U.S. aid shuttered clinics.  "We are close to 300 [worshipers] but nowadays we are only less than 150. People are sick at home."

   &lt;p&gt;From the pulpit, Reverend Billiance Chondwe counts the empty seats.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We are close to 300 [worshipers] but nowadays we are only less than 150. People are sick at home," says Chondwe — or Pastor Billy as everyone calls him — as he greeted congregants on a Sunday in early April at the entrance to his church, the Somone Community Center, a branch of the Pentecostal Holiness Church in Zambia.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;People are falling ill because the U.S.-funded clinics where they got their HIV medications and care have suddenly been shuttered. The staff is gone. The electricity has been shut off. Some patients have already run out of their daily pills that keep HIV at bay — and they have started to feel the physical consequences of the virus surging back.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The Trump Administration, in January, abruptly halted the vast majority of U.S. foreign assistance in light of their America First agenda. Officials said that &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/emergency-humanitarian-waiver-to-foreign-assistance-pause/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;lifesaving aid&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — such as HIV medications — would continue to flow. But the reality on the ground shows otherwise. An untold number of people with HIV have simply and suddenly lost access to their medication.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-60044" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                A shuttered USAID clinic in Kitwe, Zambia. The clinic provided free HIV medications and treatment to the community until it was suddenly closed in late January. People still show up at the clinic for their medicine only to find the lights out and the staff no longer there.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;That is largely because the halting of foreign assistance and cancelling of programs crippled the systems that enabled people to get their AIDS medicines. And, of the small number of programs that are technically allowed to continue, many report not being paid by the U.S. government and, thus, having to close their doors and lay off workers.  The State Department, which oversees foreign assistance, did not respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In 2024, Zambia received &lt;a href="https://foreignassistance.gov/cd/zambia/2024/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;$240 million&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the U.S. to support HIV/AIDS work, including prevention, treatment and distribution of medications. NPR visited and spoke to many in this southern African nation who have expressed great frustration that the cuts to aid came with no warning and no transition plan. But they also acknowledged that their country had become dependent on foreign aid and that the government needs to do more to fill the vast gaps left by the sudden U.S. withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"The main victim that is paying the price of this disruptive decision to cut the U.S. aid funding is the ordinary Zambian person living in poverty," says &lt;a href="https://uni-osnabrueck.academia.edu/ChrisZimba" target="_blank"&gt;Chris Zumani Zimba&lt;/a&gt;, a Zambian political scientist affiliated with the University of Central Africa. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/zambia/overview" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;World Bank&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, more than 60% of the population there lives in poverty. And, &lt;a href="https://zm.usembassy.gov/zambia-surpasses-unaids-hiv-treatment-and-viral-suppression-targets-and-on-track-to-surpass-hiv-status-awareness/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;more than 10%&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of adults in the country have HIV — half the rate of a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A study out this month in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)00401-5/abstract" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Lancet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; estimated what would happen if the U.S. does not continue its flagship HIV/AIDS program that's been pivotal to reversing the downward trend in life expectancy due to AIDS. The researchers from Oxford University and elsewhere found that half a million additional children will die of AIDS in the next 5 years in sub-Saharan Africa and nearly 3 million more African children will be orphaned by AIDS. In many Zambian communities, people say these numbers will soon be more than just a forecast.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mothers and children, husbands and wives, doctors, truck drivers and religious leaders are all grappling with the fallout of the U.S. cutting aid. Here are stories of those impacted in just one part of one country: Zambia's resource-rich Copperbelt Province.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59786" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Dorcas Mwanza, 10, took the last of her HIV medications eight days ago. She's developed a fever and chills, among the first symptoms people experience when they go off HIV treatment.

When Dorcas would get home from school, she'd often play house, pretending to prepare nshima — a thick traditional porridge — for her imaginary family. "I'm thinking she'll be very family-oriented when she grows up," says Theresa in Bemba, a local language spoken in parts of Zambia. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's now been eight days since both Dorcas and her mom, Theresa, took the last of their HIV medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;A single mom and an only child, they've always taken their medicine together at 8 p.m. each night. The change in routine has confused the little girl.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59948" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"In the past week, she'll open the tin [where the medicine is kept] and find that it's empty," says Theresa. "She'll run down to the clinic to go and check if she can collect her medication. And then she'll come back home and say, 'Oh, you are right. The clinic is closed. They're not there anymore.' "&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;And it seems like their U.S.-funded clinic is not coming back. The doors of the clinic, which services over 2,000 HIV patients, have been locked since the end of January, the staff let go and the furniture largely removed. This clinic didn't just provide medication, it also provided basic food since HIV medicine cannot be taken on an empty stomach. Theresa and Dorcas lost both.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So far, without their medication, Theresa feels okay. But Dorcas has developed a fever and chills — and she feels weak. Flu-like symptoms are often one of the first symptoms after someone goes off HIV treatment — the level of virus rises and the body tries to fight it off.&lt;strong&gt;  &lt;/strong&gt;Worried, Theresa now stays home to tend to her daughter — who often rests on a mat by the tree outside their home. But it means Theresa isn't going house to house to do laundry and odd jobs, their main source of income.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-60048" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Theresa Mwanza and her daughter, Dorcas, stand in a field near their house. After their USAID-funded clinic closed, Theresa tried to get HIV medications at a government-run clinic but was turned away and told she needed to get "direction or guidance" from that now-shuttered facility.

   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Theresa tried to get their medications at a clinic run by the Zambian government. It took an hour to walk there only to get turned away. "They keep insisting: 'You need to get direction or guidance from the clinic where you were on where you will go to next,'" she recalls. But with her neighborhood clinic closed, Theresa isn't sure what to do.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She thinks back to her two sisters who died of AIDS before medication became available — and free with help from the U.S. "I am now really worried," she says looking at her daughter. "She's a very jovial little girl, but she's been very miserable the past few days."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mary Mayongana: Thinking about 'what will become of me'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mary Mayongana, 42, typically spends her days either at the market selling vegetables or in a small family compound she shares with her family: Her mother, her four children, her two sisters and their children. "All of us live here as one big family," Mary says, speaking in Bemba.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59881" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Mary Mayongana, 42, is unsure whether her ankle sore is a result of going off her HIV medications. She says that the pain along with the fatigue she now feels are going to make it hard to walk for 45 minutes to reach the nearest clinic after the closure of the U.S.-funded clinic she had previously used.

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Now, Mary is confined to that compound. She's lost access to her HIV treatment and feels weak. She's also developed an itchy &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2025/01/31/g-s1-45601/trump-pepfar-hiv-positive-antiretroviral-waiver" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;rash&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a classic sign of going off HIV medications — it can be an indication that the body is trying to fight off &lt;a href="https://hivinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv/fact-sheets/hiv-and-rash" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the resurgent virus&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the immune system is weakening. And Mary has another challenge: her ankle is swollen from a painful open sore that continues to spread. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;Without warning, her U.S.-funded clinic closed on January 28 with a stop work order from the Trump Administration. Now the clinic's health workers are distributing the remaining supply of medications among all the patients. For more than two months, Mary hasn't been able to consistently take her HIV medication. Sometimes she's gone up to 14 days with no HIV medication at all. Right now, she has a few pills and has decided to take them every third day. It's risky because her body could develop resistance to the drug if it's not taken daily. But, Mary says, it's all she has so she needs her supply to last as long as possible.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59784" class="bucketwrap image large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;There are Zambian government clinics that still stock HIV drugs but they've been so overwhelmed by HIV patients from the shuttered U.S.-funded clinics that they've been forced to ration the medication, giving out a limited supply to each patient. And for Mary, who has no money for transportation, the government clinic seems impossibly far away. It's a 45-minute walk on a good day.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She's unsure whether her ankle sore is a result of going off her HIV medications but, she says, the pain and fatigue she feels are going to make it hard to walk to the clinic. She thinks it will take her hours each way. Her mother is urging her to do it anyway — together, she says, they can take a few steps, then rest.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I spend a lot of time thinking about what is likely to become of me, especially that I'm actually seeing myself wasting away," says Mary in a flat, quiet voice. She sits on the cement floor of her brick home, her head resting against the wall. "It's really weighing me down."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-60045" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kabamda Willies and Alice Nyandwa: 'Volunteers that attend to us are not there'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When Kabamda Willies noticed Alice Nyandwa working in the farm fields in 2018, he immediately knew he wanted to marry her. The first thing he did was to share his HIV status. "I thought it would be wise to explain to her [that I have HIV] from the very beginning," Willies says, speaking in Bemba.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;She then told him, she too is HIV positive. They soon got married.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As subsistence farmers in a very remote area, they got their medications from a community health worker who, for years, would bike to their home with their pills, delivering a six-month supply. And he could even take their blood while sitting in their thatched gazebo and then bike it back to the lab. That suddenly stopped when the U.S. surprised the world by halting the vast majority of foreign assistance.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Now, Kabamda and Alice go to the closest government clinic to get their HIV medications and tests. It's a 3- to 4-hour walk each way. Still, they make the journey. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59789" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Farmers Alice Nyandwa and Kabamda Willies say that they now must walk three to four hours each way to a government-run HIV clinic. Even when they get to the clinic, they sometimes can't get their medications because the volunteer staff — who used to receive stipends as part of U.S. aid — aren't there anymore.

&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;"Sometimes when we get to the clinic, the volunteers that attend to us are not there. So we need to arrange to walk back again on another day," says Kabamda, 63. Those volunteers are missing because many of them had received a stipend from the U.S. — and that's now dried up.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Even if the clinic is open and the couple can get served, there's another problem: The days when they'd get enough pills to last 6 months are gone. Now, Zambian government clinics are rationing HIV drugs. The state clinics didn't have warning about the U.S. cutting aid and didn't stock up on medications. So, with the onslaught of new patients, Kabamda and Alice say, they are being given medication for just two weeks. Kabamda says it's hard to find the time to return to the clinic so regularly because "we need to grow our food to eat."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oswell Sindaza: 'I'm moving like a headless chicken'&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When Oswell Sindaza was born, the story goes, his mother looked him over — head to toe — and enthusiastically said: "All is well." And so, that became his name: Oswell.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;But these days, such a happy declaration is sorely missing.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59790" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Sindaza, who's 44, is a doctor for HIV/AIDS patients. Since 2014, he's been running a project funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development which was housed within the Wusakile Mine Hospital. Sindaza used to oversee a staff of 21, including a team of nurses, doctors, pharmacists and lab technicians. The local mining company paid his salary and so, unlike his colleagues,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;whose salaries were directly or indirectly paid by U.S. foreign aid,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;he survived the funding cuts. But now, he's the only doctor left. &lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"We have over 6,400 [HIV] clients, and I'm just alone as a clinical person," says Oswell, adding that there's also one accountant and one nurse who were not funded by U.S. aid. His caseload grows each day as patients, desperate for HIV medications, arrive from nearby clinics that have been closed.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We just give them drugs. We're not taking care of the clients' needs, things like viral load testing, liver function tests, kidney function. We do not have the capacity to do that," he says. "I'm moving like a headless chicken now just to try and make things happen."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He says he worries about all the patients who can't make it to his clinic — those who live too far away or are in wheelchairs. He knows they have no medication, and he doesn't know how to help. He says he feels like he's failing his patients.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"It's really, really draining me," Oswell says. "I feel maybe I will not manage to cope going forward."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59800" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Brian Chiluba has lost weight and feels increasingly weak since losing access to his HIV drugs that he's received from a U.S.-funded clinic for the past 15 years.

He's a house painter and — with the help of HIV medication, which he's taken for 15 years — he always had the strength to do his work. But no longer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"I feel weakness — weak, weak, weak," he says as his voice cracks.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Since early February, when his local U.S.-funded clinic shut down, he's struggled to get his medication. At first, he managed to obtain a few pills here and there but, now, he's out entirely.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Sitting on a wooden bench by the window with one of his three children nearby, he says he's lost a lot of weight and feels like all the power has been drained out of him.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59783" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;Brian's wife also has HIV and has run out of her medication, too. But, so far, she says she feels fine.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The couple went to a nearby government clinic hoping they would be able to get their medications refilled. But, they say, they were told they must bring their medical records in order to register as new patients. So they've been going back to their old clinic to get their files. Every time they go, it's still shuttered. And yet, he says, they have no choice but to keep trying.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"We need to wait until there's someone at the &lt;a href="https://www.usaid.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;u&gt;USAID&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; facility," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The Zambian Ministry of Health did not respond to requests for comment on this policy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Brian worries that by the time he gets his medical record and registers at a new clinic, it will be too late. "I'm going to lose my life, and I will leave my children suffering," he says.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59798" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

Truck drivers are calling him. "They are crying," he says. "'We've got no [HIV] medicine. Where do you get [it] from?'"&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;He has no good answer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For 15 years, Geoffrey — who is now 54 — has been working with HIV-positive truck drivers and sex workers who hang out around truck stops. After his own brother died of AIDS, Geoffrey left his job as a miner, saying to himself, " 'Let me teach others not to get [HIV].' "&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59799" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Community health worker Geoffrey Chanda used to distribute HIV medications to long-haul truck drivers and sex workers at truck stops like this one near the border of Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

   &lt;p&gt;As a community health worker, he would periodically pick up a big bag of HIV treatments from a mobile clinic. Then, he'd coordinate with over 200 truck drivers — and even more sex workers. Calling and texting them, he'd figure out when they'd be passing through the border crossing and go meet them to give them their medications and make sure they had all the information they needed about how not to spread HIV.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;The dusty parking lots where Geoffrey spent his days are lined with 18-wheelers, many loaded down with freshly-mined minerals. They pause here — at the border between Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, near the town of Chililabombwe — sometimes for days, waiting for permission to cross the border.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;It's this type of location that public health experts have zeroed in on as critical in halting the spread of HIV. In the early days of the epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa, the virus fanned out along trucking routes as long-haul drivers frequented sex workers. Still today in Zambia, HIV is a particular challenge along the trucking routes.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59797" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

                Long-haul truckers sometimes pause for days at this truck stop near the Zambian town of Chililabombwe as they await approval to cross the border into the Democratic Republic of Congo. Distributing HIV medicine on trucking routes is critical to stopping the spread of HIV, say public health experts.

   &lt;p&gt;Now, with U.S. aid slashed the special effort to prevent and contain the virus in these hot spots has stopped, Geoffrey says. He no longer has the medications to distribute. He no longer has his income — and, he says, he's struggling to pay for food. But, he still picks up the continuous string of calls from truck drivers and sex workers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Geoffrey estimates that about 20 of the 200 truck drivers he worked with have called and told him they're starting to fall ill without their HIV medications. He says one of his drivers died in Congo. In the arcades and bars that line the main street, Geoffrey has heard it was because the driver didn't have his HIV medicine.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"He died in Congo. [And] bringing the body [back to Zambia], it's very expensive," says long-haul truck driver Roi Silunyange, 54, who also knew the deceased man.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-60043" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;p&gt;"If you're not feeling well, or you need a supply — maybe your medicines have run out — [we] would call that number, and [the community health workers] were always very quick at coming to us and responding to our needs," Mwape says. "So it was a very, very good system. We were not missing our medications."&lt;/p&gt;

Just 20 days of pills left. She's managed to avoid contracting HIV from her husband by taking a drug from the clinic, known as PrEP, that prevents the transmission of HIV.

He doesn't like to have these conversations, but it's important that we have them."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Mary plays out the worst case scenario in her mind: "If [Daliso] can't access his drugs — and let's say he falls ill and he dies — what then happens to us as a household? Because he's the head of our household. He takes care of us," she says. "And, if anything happens to me — if I find myself [HIV] positive…" Her voice trails off.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Their main concern is about their five children. The youngest is 2 years old and doesn't understand what's happening. But the older ones are worried.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"They're always coming to me to say, 'Give us answers.' I always tell them, 'Let's not have this conversation,'" says Mary. "I know it's not the right thing, but I'm really trying to avoid it."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Daliso and Mary went to a nearby government clinic but were told to come back later when Daliso would have only a few days of HIV pills left. Mary says that clinic is so overburdened by all the HIV patients who lost treatment when the U.S. cut aid, she's afraid they won't have any medications left for her husband.&lt;/p&gt;   
   &lt;p&gt;"This change has really devastated me," Daliso says, his voice filled with emotion. "I'm a man, but what it has done, it has really shattered me."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59794-1" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

She pulls out her phone and scrolls to the emotional, religious songs. Lately, the 16-year-old has been listening to a lot of these songs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;From the two-room house — under a huge mango tree — that she shares with her grandmother, Catherine lets the lyrics of her favorite song, "Nessa's Holy Spirit," wash over her:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Jesus I need you to survive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh come oh! Holy Spirit come oh" &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Her grandmother, who has the same name, says Catherine has been grappling with two questions for which there are no good answers.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"She began to ask why she's taking this medication, and then I had to explain to her that 'You're HIV positive,' " says Catherine's grandmother. The girl got the virus from her mother at birth but, her grandmother says, "it's been very difficult to get her to accept her situation. She says, 'What is it that I have done to get this illness?'

How will she get her next round of HIV medications when the health center where she got her free HIV medications was funded by the U.S. and has now shut down. She has one month's supply left and she worries that all the government clinics will charge money for the medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-59793" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

   &lt;h2 class="edTag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reverend Billiance Chondwe: Bringing back memories of his twin's death from AIDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As a child, Billiance Chondwe did everything with his twin sister, Charity. They insisted on just one shared dinner plate. They requested coordinated clothes. He played jump rope with her, ignoring the taunts of neighborhood children for playing a girl's game.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then — in the late 1990s — when they were 17, Charity got AIDS. Billy nursed her month after month. If he left the house, she would call out for him. He missed school to tend to her. When she died almost a year later, the grief was overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"What I felt was: I'm alone," recalls Billy, who is now 52. "It brought me to my knees. It brought me to a point where, no matter what I can do as a human being, there is a limit."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For years, he couldn't shake the smell of the disease. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then, in 2004, things started to change. There was a big push by the U.S. government to get HIV medication to Zambia, along with dozens of other countries. Since then, the U.S. has poured nearly $7 billion into controlling the HIV epidemic in Zambia, providing free HIV medications for 1.2 million Zambians.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For Billy, it felt like a weight was lifted. "Despair was taken away," he says. "Children had hope they will grow [up] with their father."&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;And then, earlier this year, came the sudden pullout of U.S. aid. Overnight, clinics were locked and shutters were bolted shut. All the doctors, nurses, community health workers and volunteers were told to stop working immediately. Patients lost access to their files — and, most important, their medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div id="resg-s1-60049" class="bucketwrap image x-large"&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;
                Reverend Billy is haunted by the memory of people dying during the height of the AIDS crisis in the 1990s. The recent pullout of U.S. foreign aid has brought back feelings of hopelessness and despair.&lt;br&gt;

    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;p&gt;Now — at Billy's branch of the Pentecostal Holiness Church in Zambia — he watches his congregation shrink as parishioners stay home, sick or tending to the sick who can't find another source of HIV medications.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;"Yesterday, I received three calls: Two of my members — they are admitted in the hospital. And I received another [call] from a couple — they are sick," says Pastor Billy. The hopelessness he felt during the years when there was no treatment for AIDS has returned. "It haunts me," he says.&lt;/p&gt;

CWD was reported in Putnam, Marshall, Adams, and Peoria counties, expanding the geographic presence of the disease in free-ranging deer populations in northern Illinois, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adams County is the first documented case recorded outside of the leading edge of the CWD endemic region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CWD is an always-fatal neurological disease that affects the long-term health of white-tailed deer in Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="tncms-region-article_instory_top" class="tncms-region hidden-print"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CWD was first documented in Illinois in 2002 near Roscoe. It has since been detected in 25 counties across northern Illinois and now as far south as Adams County in west-central Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early February 2025, CWD was detected and confirmed through diagnostic testing in Putnam, Marshall, and Adams counties from routine surveillance of hunter-harvested deer. Peoria County was confirmed in a 2-year-old deer exhibiting clinical signs consistent with CWD infection using the same diagnostic testing procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samples from Adams County underwent genetic testing to ensure genetic matches between submitted tissue samples and source deer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affected Illinois counties now include Adams, Boone, Bureau, Carroll, Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Ford, Grundy, Jo Daviess, Kane, Kankakee, Kendall, Lake, LaSalle, Lee, Livingston, Marshall, McHenry, Ogle, Peoria, Putnam, Stephenson, Will, and Winnebago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Illinois is a national leader in managing and slowing the spread of CWD, and over the past two decades IDNR’s program has served as a model for other states,” said IDNR Director Natalie Phelps Finnie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization and the &lt;a href="https://dnr.illinois.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;Centers for Disease Control&lt;/a&gt; and Prevention have not linked CWD to human transmission.

&lt;p&gt;“Get the flu shot and you are 27% more likely to get the flu!” read an April 7 X post that referenced a preprint study published on April 4. “GET THE SHOT GET THE DISEASE!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="more-on"&gt;&lt;h2 class="more-on__heading"&gt;Recommended Stories &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list of 3 items&lt;/span&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 1 of 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 2 of 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;article class="more-on__article"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;list 3 of 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;end of list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, another X post trumpeted news of the study with a call for action: “All flu ‘vaccines’ must be pulled from the market pending large prospective studies of their safety and effectiveness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warnings cite a non-peer-reviewed article by Cleveland Clinic researchers titled Effectiveness of the Influenza Vaccine During the 2024-2025 Respiratory Viral Season. It was posted on April 4 on the preprint server medRxiv, which discloses in bold typeface at the top that it “reports new medical research that has yet to be evaluated and so should not be used to guide clinical practice”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-the-study-says-and-what-it-does-not"&gt;What the study says – and what it does not&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study involved 53,402 Cleveland Clinic Health System employees in Ohio and found that its vaccinated participants had a higher incidence of infection in the most recent flu season. But a Cleveland Clinic spokesperson said it’s misleading to use the study to draw broader conclusions about vaccines and susceptibility to infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The data came from a relatively healthy population of about 50,000 healthcare workers and did not represent the general population,” Cleveland Clinic spokesperson Andrea Pacetti said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flu vaccine helps prevent flu cases from getting more severe and requiring hospitalisation. Every year, the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA’s) Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee decides which viruses to use for the upcoming season’s flu vaccine. Data collected by the FDA, World Health Organization, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other partners on which flu strains are circulating around the world inform that committee’s decision. (The committee’s meeting to discuss influenza vaccine strains for the 2025-2026 influenza season was cancelled.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDC, during seasons when the flu vaccine strains and the circulating flu strains match, the vaccine “has been shown to reduce the risk of having to go to the doctor with flu by 40% to 60%”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert H Hopkins Jr, the medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, said the Cleveland Clinic study does not evaluate the primary benefit for getting vaccinated against influenza: reducing one’s risk for severe illness, hospitalisation and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People should be aware that the effectiveness of flu vaccines vary from year to year, but even when flu vaccination does not prevent infection completely, it can make the illness milder and prevent serious complications, including hospitalisation and death,” Hopkins said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopkins said he “completely” disagrees with the social media post calling for flu vaccines’ removal from the market. “That action would result in more &lt;a href="/news/2025/3/3/rfk-jr-noted-vaccine-sceptic-backs-measles-jab-amid-deadly-us-outbreak"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; and death from flu,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nabin Shrestha, a physician and coauthor of the study, said although the results found an increased risk of influenza among vaccinated participants, the authors understood that the increased risk “could have been from an unrecognised factor” and, therefore, did not conclude that the vaccine increases infection risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shrestha also said the study did not suggest that the influenza vaccine should be pulled from the market because it makes people more likely to get the flu. “Overall, the flu vaccine is an important public health tool,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who participated in the study? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleveland Clinic requires workers to get the annual flu vaccine or seek a medical- or religion-based exemption, so this study involved a high number of vaccinated people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the participants, 43,857 were vaccinated during the study period with 98.7 percent receiving the inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine. By the study’s end, 1,079 participants had gotten the flu – roughly 2 percent of the entire study population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacetti said it was notable that only 2 percent of the participants contracted influenza during the study period. “The population did not include children and contained very few elderly or immunocompromised individuals,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study’s results indicated the cumulative incidence of influenza – or the number of new cases divided by the total number of people in the study at risk (vaccinated and not vaccinated) – increased faster among the vaccinated participants than the unvaccinated ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authors found that the influenza vaccine had a negative effectiveness, “suggesting that the vaccine has not been effective in preventing influenza” for that season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do these findings mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flu vaccine effectiveness can vary per season and per person (factoring in characteristics such as age and health), the CDC said. Their effectiveness also depends on their similarity to the influenza viruses circulating in the community, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data from the agency showed seasonal flu vaccine effectiveness – or how well the vaccine prevents severe illness and hospitalisation – changes per season with a 42 percent effectiveness rate during the 2023-2024 season. Researchers found it reduced the risk for flu-related outpatient visits and hospitalisations among children, adolescents and adults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopkins said the study did not discuss if the workplace had masking policies or other restrictions for unvaccinated employees, which “could have an important impact on the incidence of influenza”, especially for those working in clinical settings. About 10,900 participants had a clinical nursing job, the study said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacetti and Jeffrey Morris, biostatistics director at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, also said the vaccines primarily reduce the risk of death or severe disease, which the study does not address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article said the vaccine’s effectiveness in any given year “depends on how similar the strains contained in the vaccine are to the strains causing infection that year”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study’s authors also said because nearly all of its participants used the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine, it’s possible that other influenza vaccines may have been more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

From a medical standpoint, it’s referred to as dyspnea. When anxiety causes it, it’s tied to the &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/signs-fight-or-flight-mode_l_649307a2e4b06123d83171b4" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-internal-link" data-vars-item-name="“fight or flight” response" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67cf30cde4b04cf586ccdfd1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="649307a2e4b06123d83171b4" data-vars-target-content-type="buzz" data-vars-type="web_internal_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="4"&gt;“fight or flight” response&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“When we perceive a threat, whether real or imagined, the brain signals the body to enter fight-or-flight mode,” explained &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://turningtidespsychology.co.uk/about-us/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Gayle Watts" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67cf30cde4b04cf586ccdfd1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://turningtidespsychology.co.uk/about-us/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="5"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Gayle Watts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a clinical psychologist with Turning Tides Psychology. “This activates the sympathetic nervous system, which increases heart rate, tenses muscles and alters breathing patterns.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the body, a threat isn’t always as primal or life-threatening as being chased by a bear. It can also be giving a presentation, experiencing a trauma trigger or anything in between.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When your sympathetic nervous system is activated, you may hyperventilate or breathe too quickly or shallowly. That’s where the feeling like you can’t get enough air comes in. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;And unfortunately, what may feel instinctual can make matters worse. “Paradoxically, the more we focus on our breathing and try to ‘fix’ it, the more we reinforce the cycle of anxiety and air hunger,” Watts added. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anxiety and air hunger can become cyclical: You feel anxious, so you experience air hunger, and then struggling to breathe triggers more anxiety.

And it can make symptoms worse.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“Instead, slowing your breathing and focusing on a structured pattern can help rebalance oxygen and carbon dioxide levels,” she said. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watts encouraged the 4-7-8 technique: Inhale through your nose for four seconds, hold your breath for seven seconds, then exhale slowly through your mouth for eight seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“This helps activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which signals to your body that you are safe and can relax,” Watts added.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Cohen also suggested controlled breathing exercises, such as diaphragmatic breathing. Essentially, that technique is about taking deep breaths, feeling your stomach rise as you inhale and sink as you exhale.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9873947/" role="link" class=" js-entry-link cet-external-link" data-vars-item-name="Studies" data-vars-item-type="text" data-vars-unit-name="67cf30cde4b04cf586ccdfd1" data-vars-unit-type="buzz_body" data-vars-target-content-id="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9873947/" data-vars-target-content-type="url" data-vars-type="web_external_link" data-vars-subunit-name="article_body" data-vars-subunit-type="component" data-vars-position-in-subunit="14"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Studies&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; show that focusing on breath patterns enhances respiratory stability and reduces the unpredictability that often fuels panic,” he said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try cognitive reframing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) skill encourages changing your perspective to be more realistic and helpful. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the case of air hunger, it might look like this: “Air hunger is a perception, not a true lack of oxygen.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“By understanding the role of the brain in amplifying sensations, people can learn to reinterpret the experience as non-threatening, reducing the emotional distress associated with it,” Cohen explained. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repeat a positive mantra.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One Thompson-Keene suggested was “I’m safe and this will pass.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;She added, “It is a way to help ground your mind and body in the present moment.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice mindfulness-based stress reduction.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="primary-cli cli cli-text "&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This toolkit is similar to some of the other tips.

            In the past six months, two babies in Louisiana have died of pertussis, the disease commonly known as whooping cough.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sl000b3b6ooap27dv3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Washington state recently announced its first confirmed death from pertussis in more than a decade.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sl000c3b6ouxv4tpwi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Idaho and South Dakota each reported a death this year, and Oregon last year reported two as well as its highest number of cases since 1950.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/html-embed/instances/cm9d4d6of009a3b6ot916aizn@published" class="html-embed" data-editable="settings" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;

            While much of the country is focused on the spiraling measles outbreak concentrated in the small, dusty towns of West Texas, cases of pertussis have skyrocketed by more than 1,500% nationwide since hitting a recent low in 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Deaths tied to the disease are also up, hitting 10 last year, compared with about two to four in previous years. Cases are on track to exceed that total this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o06s00093b6ogu8tyzg0@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Doctors, researchers and public health experts warn that the measles outbreak, which has grown to more than 600 cases, may just be the beginning. They say outbreaks of preventable diseases could get much worse with falling vaccination rates and the Trump administration slashing spending on the country’s public health infrastructure.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sm000h3b6oxzosf3n5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            National rates for four major vaccines, which had held relatively steady in the years before the COVID-19 pandemic, have fallen significantly since, according to a ProPublica analysis of the most recent federal kindergarten vaccination data. Not only have vaccination rates for measles, mumps and rubella fallen, but federal data shows that so have those for pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B and polio.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sm000i3b6oc6jfohfr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In addition, public health experts say that growing pockets of unvaccinated populations across the country place babies and young children in danger should there be a resurgence of these diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sm000l3b6o1gtzq3f6@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Many medical authorities view measles, which is especially contagious, as the canary in the coal mine, but pertussis cases may also be a warning, albeit one that has attracted far less attention.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sm000m3b6o3qsr24nm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is not just measles,” said Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious diseases doctor in New York City and author of the book “Booster Shots: The Urgent Lessons of Measles and the Uncertain Future of Children’s Health.” “It’s a bright-red warning light.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sm000n3b6oui3ipol7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            At least 36 states have witnessed a drop in rates for at least one key vaccine from the 2013-14 to the 2023-24 school years. And half of states have seen an across-the-board decline in all four vaccination rates. Wisconsin, Utah and Alaska have experienced some of the most precipitous drops during that time, with declines of more than 10 percentage points in some cases.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sm000o3b6oume8rc45@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There is a direct correlation between vaccination rates and vaccine-preventable disease outbreak rates,” said a spokesperson for the Utah Department of Health and Human Services. “Decreases in vaccination rates will likely lead to more outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in Utah.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d412u200913b6our7c62bb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But statewide figures alone don’t provide a full picture. Tucked inside each state are counties and communities with far lower vaccination rates that drive outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn003t3b6oui1qjj53@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            For example, the whooping cough vaccination rate for kindergartners in Washington state in 2023-24 was 90.2%, slightly below the U.S. rate of 92.3%, federal data shows. But the statewide rate for children 19 to 35 months last year was 65.4%, according to state data. In four counties, that rate was in the 30% range. In one county, it was below 12%.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn003u3b6o1b1drajs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “My concern is that there is going to be a large outbreak of not just measles, but other vaccine-preventable diseases as well, that’s going to end up causing a lot of harm, and possibly deaths in children and young adults,” said Dr. Anna Durbin, a professor in the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who has spent her career studying vaccines. “And it’s completely preventable.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn003v3b6ox7b4almd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The dramatic cuts to public health funding and staffing could heighten the risk. And the elevation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, to the secretary of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, several experts said, has only compounded matters.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn003w3b6ois9xqhhk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Trump administration has eliminated 20,000 jobs at agencies within HHS, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the nation’s public health agency. And late last month, the administration also cut $11 billion from state and local public health agencies on the front lines of protecting Americans from outbreaks; the administration said the money was no longer necessary after the end of the pandemic.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn003x3b6oiunra599@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Several city and county public health officials had to move quickly to lay off nurses, epidemiologists and disease inspectors. Some ceased vaccination clinics, halted wastewater surveillance programs and even terminated a contract with the courier service that transports specimens to state labs to test for infectious diseases. One Minnesota public health agency, which had provided 1,400 shots for children at clinics last year, immediately stopped those clinics when the directive arrived, court records show.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn003y3b6oo3lv2syh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A federal judge temporarily barred HHS from enacting the cuts, but the ruling, which came more than a week after the grants were terminated, was too late for programs that had already been canceled and employees who had already been laid off. Lawyers for HHS have asked the judge to reconsider her decision in light of a recent Supreme Court ruling that allowed the Department of Education to terminate grants for teacher training while that case is being argued in lower courts. The judge in the HHS case has not yet ruled on the motion.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn003z3b6o8wgdkjov@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But in tiny storefronts and cozy homes, at school fairs and gas stations, many residents in West Texas, near where the measles outbreak has taken hold, appear unfazed.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00403b6o28docmo2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “I don’t need a vaccine,” one man sitting on his porch said recently. “I don’t get sick.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00413b6o24l8d6aa@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s measles. It’s been around forever,” said a woman making her way to her car. “I don’t think it’s a big deal.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00423b6orrcgbvdj@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            When asked why they weren’t planning on vaccinating their baby, a husband walking alongside his wife who was 27 weeks pregnant simply said, “It’s God’s will.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d41jxi00943b6oceg4eb66@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In word and deed, Kennedy has sown doubt about immunizations.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00443b6o2116cjsl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In response to the measles outbreak, Kennedy initially said in a column he wrote for Fox News that the decision to vaccinate is a “personal one.” HHS sent doses of vitamin A alongside vaccines to Texas, and Kennedy praised the use of cod liver oil. Only the vaccine prevents measles.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00453b6oikgs4ecd@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            About a week later, in an interview on Fox News, while Kennedy encouraged vaccines, he said he was a “freedom of choice person.” At the same time, he emphasized the risks of the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00463b6oqpsd77zy@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Only after the second measles death in Texas did &lt;a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414" target="_blank"&gt;Kennedy post&lt;/a&gt; on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the “most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00473b6o7k74r7mt@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But even that is not the unequivocal message that the head of HHS should be sending, said Ratner, the infectious diseases doctor in New York. It is, he said, a tepid recommendation at best.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00483b6orkb3o5mi@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It gives the impression that these things are equivalent, that you can choose one or the other, and that is disingenuous,” he said. “We don’t have a treatment for measles. We have vitamin A, which we can give to kids with measles, that decreases but doesn’t eliminate the risk of severe outcomes. It doesn’t do anything for prevention of measles.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00493b6oqyol1duz@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In the past, Kennedy has been a fierce critic of the vaccine. In a foreword to a 2021 book on measles released by the nonprofit that he founded, Kennedy wrote, “Measles outbreaks have been fabricated to create fear that in turn forces government officials to ‘do something.’ They then inflict unnecessary and risky vaccines on millions of children for the sole purpose of fattening industry profits.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004a3b6o1qw1ipve@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            A spokesperson for HHS said, “Secretary Kennedy is not anti-vaccine — he is pro-safety, pro-transparency and pro-accountability.” Kennedy, the spokesperson said, responded to the measles outbreak with “clear guidance that vaccines are the most effective way to prevent measles” and under his leadership, the CDC updated its pediatric patient management protocol for measles to include physician-administered vitamin A.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004b3b6ojnblk0gx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy, the spokesperson added, “is uniquely qualified to lead HHS at this pivotal moment.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004c3b6ozfl95v7a@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Late last month, leaders at the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/measles-vaccine-rfk-cdc-report" target="_blank"&gt;ordered staff to bury a risk assessment&lt;/a&gt; that emphasized the need for vaccines in response to the measles outbreak — in spite of the fact the CDC has long &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/partners/vaccinate-with-confidence.html" target="_blank"&gt;promoted vaccinations&lt;/a&gt; as a cornerstone of public health. While a CDC spokesperson acknowledged that vaccines offer the best protection from measles, she also repeated a line Kennedy had used: “The decision to vaccinate is a personal one.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004d3b6o5h2nf56i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among the approximately 2,400 jobs eliminated at the CDC was a team in the Immunization Services Division that partnered with &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-equity/php/about/partnering-for-vaccine-equity-partners.html" target="_blank"&gt;organizations&lt;/a&gt; to promote access to and confidence in vaccines in communities where coverage lagged.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004e3b6o0s1lr9d5@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The National Institutes of Health, which is also under HHS, recently ended funding for studies that examine vaccine hesitancy. In early April, researchers, the American Public Health Association and one of the largest unions in the country sued the NIH and its director, Jay Bhattacharya, along with HHS and Kennedy, alleging they terminated grants “without scientifically-valid explanation or cause.” The government hasn’t filed a response in the case.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004f3b6oy2nxc4w2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The NIH cancellation notices stated that the agency’s policy was not to prioritize research that focuses on “gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004g3b6o83v3iigh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “These grants are being canceled in the midst of an outbreak, a vaccine-preventable outbreak,” said Rupali Limaye, an associate professor at George Mason University who has spent the past decade studying vaccine hesitancy. “We need to better understand why people are not accepting vaccines now more than ever. This outbreak is still spreading.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004h3b6oa70j5ggw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            That vaccines prevent diseases is settled science. For decades, there was a societal understanding that getting vaccinated benefited not only the person who got the shot, but also the broader community, especially babies or people with weakened immune systems, like those in chemotherapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004i3b6onzafa7c7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            An investment in public health and a sustained, large-scale approach to vaccines is what helped the country declare the elimination of the measles in 2000, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, the CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004j3b6o4fsr40cl@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            But she has watched both deteriorate over the last few months. Nearly every morning since notices of the federal funding cuts began going out to local public health agencies, she has woken up to texts from panicked public health workers. She has led daily calls with local health departments and sat in on multiple emergency board meetings.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004k3b6o7vafb83w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Freeman has compiled a list of more than 100 direct consequences of the cuts, including one rural health department in the Midwest that can no longer carry out immunization services. That’s vital because there are no hospitals in the county and all public health duties fall to the health department.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004l3b6o4eo1g15e@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “It’s relentless,” she said. “It feels like a barrage and assault on public health.”
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004m3b6obcf2ywx2@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            More than 1,600 miles away from Washington, D.C., in Lubbock, Texas, the director of the city’s health department, Katherine Wells, sighed last week when she saw the most recent measles numbers. She would have to alert her staff to work late again.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004n3b6ofamj15c1@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “There’s a lot of cases,” she said, “and we continue to see more and more cases.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004o3b6oirt2j4ug@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She didn’t know it at the time, but that night would mark the state’s second measles death this year. An earlier death in February was the country’s first in a decade. Both children were not vaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004p3b6orw5icw9w@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Kennedy said he traveled to Gaines County to comfort the family who lost their 8-year-old daughter and while there met with the family of the 6-year-old girl who died in February.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004q3b6o7j739b4p@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            He also visited with two local doctors he described as “extraordinary healers,” he said in his post on X. The men, he claimed, have “treated and healed some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children” using aerosolized budesonide — typically used to prevent symptoms of asthma — and clarithromycin — an antibiotic. Medical experts said neither is an effective measles treatment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004r3b6o1unee47i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            State health officials have traced about two-thirds of the measles cases in Texas to Gaines County, which sits on the western edge of the state.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004s3b6ooulh4kus@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Seminole, one of the county’s only two incorporated towns, has emerged as the epicenter of the outbreak, with Tina Siemens acting as a community ambassador of sorts.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004t3b6ohfm8q2b7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Siemens, a tall woman with glasses and a short blonde bob, runs a museum that combines the area’s Native American history and Mennonite community with traditional skills like calligraphy and canning fruit.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004u3b6o7r0hswui@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            On a recent Tuesday, atop the museum’s dark coffee table, notes scrawled onto white paper listed the latest shipments of vitamin C and Alaskan cod liver oil.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004v3b6ozfcf6xxb@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The supplies, Siemens said, were for one of the local doctors who met with Kennedy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004w3b6oz02xu2hs@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            As measles tears through the community, Siemens said families have to decide whether to get vaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004x3b6oahxj5yfv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “In America, we have a choice,” she said, echoing Kennedy’s messaging. “The cod liver oil that was flown in, the vitamin C that was flown in, was a great help.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004y3b6oitpofuug@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Dr. Philip Huang, director and health authority for the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department, is working to keep the measles outbreak from reaching his community, just five hours east of Seminole. He wrote letters to the public school superintendents and leaders of private schools that had large numbers of unvaccinated or undervaccinated students offering to set up mobile vaccine clinics for them.
    &lt;/p&gt;



    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn004z3b6ou38lo62l@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Overall, the rates can look OK,” he said, “but when you’ve got these pockets of unvaccinated, that’s where the vulnerability lies.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00503b6oyc8d96am@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Huang has had to lay off 11 full-time employees, 10 temporary workers and cancel more than 50 vaccine clinics following the HHS cuts. The systemic dismantling of the CDC and other federal health agencies, he said, will have a grave and lasting impact.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00513b6ocn9votuv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “This is setting us back decades,” Huang said. “Everyone should be extremely concerned about what’s going on.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00523b6owlqdlai8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Across the country, pediatricians are petrified, said Dr. Susan Kressly, who serves as president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the largest professional organization of pediatricians in the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00533b6oebeebuy8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Many of us are losing sleep,” Kressly said. “If we lose that progress, children will pay the price.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00543b6oul37gr61@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            She’s carefully watching the spread of several vaccine-preventable diseases, including an increase in whooping cases that far outpace the typical peaks seen every few years. Although the whooping cough vaccine isn’t as effective as the ones for measles and protection wanes over time, the CDC says it remains the best way to prevent the disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00553b6o9r9fe7ta@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Babies under the age of 1 are among the most at risk of severe complications from whooping cough, including slowed or stopped breathing and pneumonia, according to the CDC. About one-third of infants who get whooping cough end up in the hospital. Newborns are especially vulnerable because the CDC doesn’t recommend the first shot until two months. That’s why experts recommend pregnant mothers and anyone who will be around the baby to get vaccinated.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00563b6o2mp9c90y@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The number of whooping cough cases dropped significantly during the pandemic, but it exploded in recent years. In 2021, the CDC reported 2,116 cases; last year, there were 35,435.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00573b6or50e0g8d@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The numbers this year appear set to eclipse 2024. So far in 2025, 7,111 cases have been reported, which is more than double this time last year. Cases tend to spike in the summer and fall, which adds to experts’ concern about high numbers so early in the year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00583b6ofndyr6ro@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            States on the Pacific Coast and in the Midwest have reported the most cases this year, with Washington leading the country with 742 cases so far, more than five times as many as at this time last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn00593b6oc5iwtho7@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            The Washington child who died of whooping cough had no underlying medical conditions, according to a spokesperson for the Spokane Regional Health District. The death was announced in February but occurred in November.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005a3b6ofo8tbqm3@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While Washington’s overall vaccination rate for whooping cough has remained relatively steady over the last decade at around 90%, pockets of low vaccination rates have allowed the disease to take root and put the wider community at risk, said Dr. Tao Sheng Kwan-Gett, a pediatrician and chief health officer of the Washington State Department of Health.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005b3b6op6ev6cqm@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This is the time to strengthen the public health system, he said, to build trust in those areas and make it easier for children to get their routine vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005c3b6o2zjre9qf@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “But instead, we’re seeing the exact opposite happen,” he said. “We’re weakening our public health system, and that will put us on a path towards more illness and shorter lives.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005d3b6oskrkcxpv@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Washington was one of 23 states and the District of Columbia that sued HHS and Kennedy following the $11 billion cuts, which rescinded approximately $118 million from the state. Doing so, the state said in court records, would impact 150 full-time employees and cause an immediate reduction in the agency’s ability to respond to outbreaks.
    &lt;/p&gt;

  





    &lt;p class="paragraph inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cm9d3o0sn005e3b6o0ike7y3i@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Washington’s Care-A-Van, a mobile health clinic that travels across the state to provide vaccinations, conduct blood pressure screenings and distribute opioid overdose kits, was a key element in the department’s vaccination efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            But that, too, has been diminished.

            An alert on the department’s website cataloged the impact.

            As a result of the unexpected decision to terminate grant funding, “all Care-A-Van operations have been paused indefinitely, including the cancellation of more than 104 upcoming clinics across the state.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            The department had anticipated providing approximately 2,000 childhood vaccines as part of that effort.

            The frustration came through in Kwan-Gett’s voice. Many people think that federal cuts to public health mean shrinking the federal workforce, he said, but those clawbacks also get passed down to states and cities and counties. The less federal support that trickles down to the local level, the less protected communities will be.
    &lt;/p&gt;

A recent study revealed that the average human brain may contain the equivalent of a whopping five plastic bottle caps' worth of microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The New York Times took a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/well/microplastics-health.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:deeper dive;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;deeper dive&lt;/a&gt; into the topic on the heels of that study making the rounds in February, showing that scientists are only beginning to scratch the surface of what this could mean for our health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's happening?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/hBueN" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:groundbreaking study;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;groundbreaking study&lt;/a&gt; led by researchers at the University of New Mexico, scientists found that brain samples from 2024 contained nearly 50% more microplastics than those from just eight years ago. The average brain held roughly seven grams of plastic — the same as a disposable spoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;More concerning still, the researchers observed higher levels of microplastics in the brains of people with dementia, though as the Times noted, the scientists at the lab "noted that might be because those brains have a more porous blood-brain barrier and are less able to clear toxins." Similar plastic particles have already been found in the human &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/toxsci/article/199/1/81/7609801?login=true" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:placenta;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;placenta&lt;/a&gt;, bloodstream, and even a baby's first stool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;As plastic accumulation balloons in the environment, it mirrors this growth in our bodies. "This stuff is increasing in our world exponentially," toxicologist Dr. Matthew Campen told &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/well/microplastics-health.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:The New York Times;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;Why is this discovery concerning?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Once they enter the human body, some microplastic particles are so small they can pass through critical barriers and lodge in organs like the brain. While scientists haven't yet nailed down how much plastic is too much, early research findings suggest nothing short of dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Cue the groans of hopelessness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;"I don't think I've talked to a single person who's said: 'Fantastic! Love to know that there's all that plastic in my brain,'" Dr. Campen told the Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Current research shows links between microplastics and serious health issues, including cognitive decline, reproductive concerns, immune system disruption, memory loss, hormonal disruptions, and even developmental problems in children. And because most of this plastic waste is decades old, it's not just a problem of the future — it's already here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Additionally, since microplastics also seep into the soil, water, and pollute the ecosystems, they pose a threat not only to people, but also to the wildlife and food systems we rely on. In short, this isn't simply a medical concern — it is a public health and environmental challenge with severe global implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="mb-4 text-lg font-bold"&gt;What's being done about it?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;The Times' deep dive, which has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/08/well/microplastics-health.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:many more fascinating details;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;many more fascinating details&lt;/a&gt;, noted that Dr. Campden's team is continuing its research and "now studying tissue from cross-sections of a single brain to find out whether certain regions have higher microplastics concentrations and whether that could be linked to issues like Parkinson's or memory loss."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While researchers continue to investigate the health impacts of microplastics, efforts are already underway to tackle the problem from multiple fronts. Countries like France, England, and India have introduced bans on common single-use plastics, while cities including Los Angeles and New York are restricting items like Styrofoam and plastic produce bags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;From the scientific viewpoint, researchers are developing new materials that break down more easily and are even testing innovative ways to filter microplastics from water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;On the individual level, practicing habits like swapping out &lt;a href="https://guide.thecooldown.com/journeys/use-less-plastic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:single-use plastics;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;single-use plastics&lt;/a&gt; for reusable alternatives, avoiding microwaving food in plastic containers, and using microfiber-catching laundry bags can all go a long way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Join our &lt;a href="https://www.thecooldown.com/tech-newsletter/?recH1BXENM1cVWFva" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:free newsletter;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;free newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for weekly updates on the latest innovations &lt;strong&gt;improving our lives&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;shaping our future&lt;/strong&gt;, and don't miss &lt;a href="https://rb.gy/ivhzmj" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:this cool list;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link "&gt;this cool list&lt;/a&gt; of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 10:45:01 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiigFBVV95cUxQTmNjQW9WYXNCMHZGVXZHU3hTbmdkUTRfV19tR0UyZ2lxNzAyTmRpSEVXWXVsZjNIUkQ0TEJHRWxORk1FS2ZXZS1RUjc1ODNDbG4za1RyMHdNT01UcURSRkdnTUx3alVmQWtTcG9sVkwxdGVtMVlvZHNIOU9OQ290al9xWWlzd1pXZ0E</guid></item><item><title>科学家将抗抑郁药与年轻人的长期生殖器麻木联系起来- PsyPost | Scientists link antidepressants to long-lasting genital numbness in young people - PsyPost</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiqAFBVV95cUxQZ3M1UGlMTXA3bGpMSUlsVUNEaHk3akhXZW5fUFhMbXZLLXplYzhyWV9vam9ZN1B4MlJ0a0laWlM4RXR3a3JTWDhFN2xVOGh2VU51X1poWHNXYUlHNjhPYm9BMTdQeHhhOTJoSTE2NldjNDlnZFN4bTdpd2lyTkFXNVFVcnV2LWZOdmZyOE1TN0VfblZwMTR1YThXT2V3eFpCUkQxbFZweWk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new study has found that some young people report a persistent loss of genital sensitivity after stopping antidepressants. This symptom—often described as numbness—was significantly more common in people who had taken antidepressants compared to those who used other psychiatric medications. The study, published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00127-024-02769-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, suggests that a notable portion of young antidepressant users may experience enduring sexual side effects, particularly among sexual and gender minority groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were motivated by growing concern around a condition known as post-SSRI sexual dysfunction, in which sexual side effects, including reduced genital sensitivity, continue even after discontinuing selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and similar antidepressants. While these side effects are recognized during treatment, there is less awareness about their potential persistence. Many patients may not feel comfortable discussing sexual difficulties with their doctors, and some clinicians may attribute the symptoms to underlying psychological issues rather than possible effects of the medication. This has made it difficult to estimate how common persistent sexual side effects really are, particularly in non-clinical populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address this knowledge gap, the research team analyzed data from a large, anonymous online survey called UnACoRN (Understanding Affirming Communities, Relationships, and Networks), conducted in 2022. The survey gathered responses from 9,679 young people aged 15 to 29 across the United States and Canada, with more than 95% identifying as sexual or gender minorities. Of these, 2,179 participants had used psychiatric medication in the past and had been sexually active—criteria that allowed for assessment of genital sensitivity during and after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Participants were asked if they had ever experienced “less feeling in your genitals when having sex,” and whether this symptom continued after they stopped taking their medication. The researchers focused on those who reported past use of antidepressants, sedatives, or antipsychotics, while excluding anyone who had undergone genital surgery or who had not been sexually active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysis revealed a striking difference between medication groups. Among participants who had taken antidepressants, 30.8% reported genital numbness during treatment, and 13.2% said the symptom continued after they stopped the medication. In contrast, only 8.2% of those who took sedatives or antipsychotics (but not antidepressants) reported genital numbness, and just 1.0% said the symptom persisted. No persistent symptoms were reported among those who had only taken antipsychotics and had stopped treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To better understand these results, the researchers used statistical models that accounted for several factors, including age, sex assigned at birth, use of gender-affirming hormones, and depression severity. Even after adjusting for these variables, past use of antidepressants was strongly associated with reports of persistent genital numbness. The odds were more than 14 times higher for those who had taken antidepressants compared to those who had not. Sedative use and severe depression were also linked to increased reports of persistent genital numbness, though to a lesser extent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings point to reduced genital sensitivity as a potential marker of long-term antidepressant effects. The symptom, often referred to in medical literature as genital hypoesthesia, is considered a defining feature of post-SSRI sexual dysfunction. Unlike more general sexual difficulties, which can be associated with depression itself, genital numbness is less commonly linked to psychological causes and may be more directly related to the pharmacological effects of certain drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the study found these symptoms in a young, sexually diverse population that is often underrepresented in clinical research. Sexual and gender minority youth are more likely to be prescribed antidepressants due to higher rates of mood and anxiety disorders. This makes it especially important to understand the full range of potential side effects they might face when undergoing treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the study offers new insight into a relatively understudied phenomenon, it also has several limitations. The survey did not distinguish between specific types of antidepressants, such as SSRIs versus other drug classes, although most antidepressant prescriptions for youth are SSRIs or SNRIs. The data were also based on self-reports, which introduces the possibility of recall bias. Additionally, the researchers could not determine how long symptoms persisted after treatment or whether they were limited to reduced genital sensitivity or included other sexual side effects. The survey did not include baseline measures of sexual functioning before participants began taking medication, so it’s not possible to confirm whether the antidepressants caused the symptoms or simply coincided with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers emphasize the need for future studies to follow people over time and assess sexual symptoms before, during, and after treatment. Such longitudinal research would help determine whether reduced genital sensitivity is truly a lasting effect of antidepressant use, how long it tends to persist, and whether any treatments can help reverse it. More clinical research is also needed to better understand the biological mechanisms involved and whether certain people are more vulnerable than others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Many people benefit from SSRI/SNRI medications; however, they may cause persistent symptoms of sexual dysfunction,” the researchers concluded. “Transparency about the risks and meaningful informed consent are central to ethical prescribing. Additionally, patients should be made aware of alternative treatments, particularly those at an early stage of sexualdevelopment. Increased surveillance and industry regulation are paramount to avoid further iatrogenic outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-024-02769-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Frequency of self-reported persistent post-treatment genital hypoesthesia among past antidepressant users: a cross-sectional survey of sexual and gender minority youth in Canada and the US&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Yassie Pirani, J.

Kennedy Jr. claimed in a televised Cabinet meeting Thursday that measles cases were plateauing nationally, but the virus continues to spread mostly in people who are unvaccinated, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention redeployed a team to west Texas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States has more than double the number of measles cases it saw in all of 2024, and Texas is reporting the majority of them, with 541 as of last week’s updated count.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas’ cases include two unvaccinated elementary school-age children who died from measles-related illnesses near the epicenter of the outbreak in rural west Texas, which led Kennedy to visit the community this month. The third person who died was an adult in New Mexico who also was not vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other states with active outbreaks — defined as having three or more cases — include New Mexico, Indiana, &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/aP4Au/?v=3" target="_blank"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt;, Ohio and Oklahoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The multistate outbreak confirms health experts’ fears that the virus will take hold in other U.S. communities with low vaccination rates and that the spread could stretch on for a year. The World Health Organization has said cases in &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news/item/2025-DON561" target="_blank"&gt;Mexico&lt;/a&gt; are linked to the Texas outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles is caused by a highly contagious virus that’s airborne and spreads easily when an infected person breathes, sneezes or coughs. It is preventable through vaccines, and had been considered eliminated from the U.S. in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what else you need to know about measles in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="texas-and-new-mexico" class="subhead"&gt;Texas and New Mexico&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Texas’ outbreak began in late January. State health officials said Friday that there were 36 new cases of measles since Tuesday, bringing the total to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/sxSwi/?v=7" target="_blank"&gt;541 across 22 counties&lt;/a&gt; — most of them in west Texas. A total of 56 Texans have been hospitalized throughout the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the confirmed cases, state health officials estimated Friday that about 5% are actively infectious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixty-five percent of Texas’ cases are in Gaines County, population 22,892, where the virus started spreading in a close-knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community. The county has logged 355 cases since late January — just over 1% of the county’s residents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest death in Texas was that of an 8-year-old child. Health officials in Texas said the child did not have underlying health conditions and died of “what the child’s doctor described as measles pulmonary failure.” A 6-year-old died of measles in Texas in late February. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Mexico announced two new cases Friday, bringing the state’s total to 58. State health officials say the cases are linked to Texas’ outbreak based on genetic testing. Most are in Lea County, where two people have been hospitalized, two are in Eddy County and one is in Chaves County.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Mexico reported its first measles-related death in an adult on March 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="kansas" class="subhead"&gt;Kansas&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.datawrapper.de/_/aP4Au/?v=3" target="_blank"&gt;Kansas&lt;/a&gt; has 32 cases in eight counties in the southwest part of the state, health officials announced Wednesday. Two of the counties, Finney and Ford, are new on the list and are major population centers in that part of the state. Haskell County has the most with eight cases, Stevens County has seven, Kiowa County has six, and the rest have five or fewer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state’s first reported case, identified in Stevens County on March 13, is linked to the Texas and New Mexico outbreaks based on genetic testing, a state health department spokesperson said. But health officials have not determined how the person was exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="oklahoma" class="subhead"&gt;Oklahoma&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cases in Oklahoma increased by two Friday to 12 total: nine confirmed and three probable cases. The first two probable cases were “associated” with the west Texas and New Mexico outbreaks, the state health department said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A health department spokesperson said measles exposures were confirmed in Tulsa and Rogers counties, but wouldn’t say which counties had cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="ohio" class="subhead"&gt;Ohio&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ohio Department of Health confirmed 20 measles cases in the state as of Thursday: 11 in Ashtabula County near Cleveland, seven in Knox County and one each in Allen and Holmes counties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ohio is not including nonresidents in its count, a state health department spokesperson told the Associated Press. The Knox County outbreak in east-central Ohio has infected 14 people, according to a news release from the county health department, but seven of them do not live in Ohio. In 2022, a measles outbreak in central Ohio sickened 85.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outbreak in Ashtabula County started with an unvaccinated adult who had interacted with someone who had traveled internationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="indiana" class="subhead"&gt;Indiana&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indiana confirmed six connected cases of measles in Allen County in the northeast part of the state; four are unvaccinated minors and two are adults whose vaccination status is unknown. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases have no known link to other outbreaks, the Allen County Department of Health said Wednesday. The first case was confirmed April 7.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="elsewhere" class="subhead"&gt;Elsewhere&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles cases also have been reported in Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines an outbreak as three or more related cases. The agency counted &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/" target="_blank"&gt;seven clusters&lt;/a&gt; that qualified as outbreaks in 2025 as of Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., cases and outbreaks are frequently traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. It can then spread, especially in communities with low vaccination rates. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1,274 cases. So far in 2025, the CDC’s count is 712.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="is-a-measles-booster-necessary" class="subhead"&gt;Is a measles booster necessary?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to avoid measles is to get the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-safety/vaccines/mmr.html" target="_blank"&gt;measles, mumps and rubella&lt;/a&gt; (MMR) vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People at high risk for infection who got the shots many years ago may want to consider getting a booster if they live in an area with an outbreak, said Scott Weaver with the Global Virus Network, an international coalition. Those may include family members living with someone who has measles or those especially vulnerable to respiratory diseases because of underlying medical conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adults with “presumptive evidence of immunity” generally don’t need measles shots now, the CDC said. Criteria include written documentation of adequate vaccination earlier in life, lab confirmation of past infection or having been born before 1957, when most people were likely to be infected naturally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A doctor can order a lab test called an MMR titer to check your levels of measles antibodies, but experts don’t always recommend it and health insurance plans may not cover it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting another MMR shot is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who have documentation of having received a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don’t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective measles vaccine made from “killed” virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said. That also includes people who don’t know which type they got.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-symptoms" class="subhead"&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees, according to the CDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/signs-symptoms/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;dangerous complications&lt;/a&gt; such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="how-can-you-treat-measles" class="subhead"&gt;How can you treat measles?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 id="why-do-vaccination-rates-matter" class="subhead"&gt;Why do vaccination rates matter?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In communities with high vaccination rates — above 95% — diseases like measles have a harder time spreading through communities. This is called herd immunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic, and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. saw a rise in measles cases in 2024, including an outbreak in Chicago that sickened more than 60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shastri writes for the Associated Press.

Yet nearly 12.5% of the people in the U.S. aged 19 or older are not getting enough of this essential vitamin.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is particularly common among older adults, people who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet and individuals with certain digestive disorders. If you fall into one of these groups, you may have been advised to take a vitamin B12 supplement. However, in order to unlock your supplement’s full potential, timing may be just as important as the supplement itself. So, we asked dietitians for their expertise on the best time to take vitamin B12 for maximum absorption.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-types-of-vitamin-b12-supplements"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Types of Vitamin B12 Supplements &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can find vitamin B12 supplements in four different forms: cyanocobalamin, methylcobalamin, hydroxocobalamin and adenosylcobalamin.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.edwinaclark.com/about-me/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;Edwina Clark, M.S., RD, CSSD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian, highlights their unique properties:&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyanocobalamin&lt;/strong&gt;: The most common, cost-effective and stable form with a well-established record for safety and efficacy. It is synthetically produced and must be converted into active forms that the body can readily use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methylcobalamin: &lt;/strong&gt;An active form naturally found in animal foods that is readily used by the body. It also has a strong track record for safety and efficacy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hydroxocobalamin:&lt;/strong&gt; Often given as an injection, this form of vitamin B12 lasts longer in the bloodstream and is used to treat severe deficiencies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adenosylcobalamin: &lt;/strong&gt;A naturally active form that is present in the mitochondria (powerhouse of the cell) and involved in energy production. However, it is less commonly available and not as well studied as other forms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “The dosage and delivery (supplement vs. intramuscular injection) should be personalized to the individual and adjusted as lab levels change. For those with malabsorption issues, intramuscular B12 injections may be necessary. For others, oral B12 supplements can be effective for raising vitamin B12 and typically cost far less,” Clark explains.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Oral B12 supplements can vary in form, with options ranging from tablets and sprays to drops placed under the tongue. Studies suggest there is no difference in efficacy between the different delivery methods.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-optimal-timing-for-vitamin-b12-intake"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Optimal Timing for Vitamin B12 Intake &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While research hasn’t nailed down a set-in-stone time for optimal absorption, taking your vitamin B12 supplement in the morning before breakfast is often recommended. Here’s why: &lt;a href="https://www.delishknowledge.com/about/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="externalLink" data-ordinal="1" rel="nofollow"&gt;Alexandra Caspero, M.A., RD&lt;/a&gt;, a registered dietitian specializing in plant-based nutrition, shares that vitamin B12 absorption peaks around 7 hours after taking it, which is why many practitioners suggest incorporating it into your morning routine to reap its benefits throughout the day.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; To make it easier to remember, Clark recommends pairing your B12 supplement with an existing habit, like brushing your teeth in the morning. After all, B12 is a water-soluble vitamin, meaning it doesn’t stick around in your body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Therefore, consistency is crucial for keeping your B12 levels up and correcting any deficiency.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-factors-affecting-vitamin-b12-absorption"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Factors Affecting Vitamin B12 Absorption &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Getting the timing right is just one part of the equation. Other factors can either help or hinder the absorption of vitamin B12.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Factors That Enhance Absorption &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; When it comes to enhancing vitamin B12 absorption, the dose matters. “B12 is absorbed differently than other B vitamins, and that’s because of intrinsic factor, a protein found in the stomach that is needed for proper B12 absorption. We only absorb about 1 microgram of B12 at a time, though that number can vary based on the dose,” says Caspero.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For this reason, you will notice that vitamin B12 supplements contain a higher amount of B12 than is normally found in food.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_25-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; “For those who consume B12 throughout the day from animal products, this isn’t usually a concern. However, for vegans and vegetarians, if taking only a single supplement, then a higher dose is needed,” Caspero explains. As such, she suggests that adults take at least 25 micrograms of vitamin B12 daily, with higher doses of 50 to 250 micrograms during pregnancy and lactation to support absorption and address deficiencies.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, it’s always best to consult your health care provider to evaluate your B12 levels and determine the dosage that’s right for you.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_26-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Factors That Prevent Absorption &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_28-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Absorbing vitamin B12 isn’t always a smooth process, as there are several factors that can complicate its uptake in the body. For instance, inadequate stomach acid and intrinsic factor can hinder absorption. “Stomach acid helps cleave B12 from food, and intrinsic factor is essential for transporting B12 into the small intestine. However, various conditions and medications can reduce stomach acid and intrinsic factor, raising your risk of B12 deficiency,” says Clark. These include pernicious anemia, certain medications like antacids and metformin, gastric bypass surgery and even older age.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Additionally, Clark points out that gastrointestinal (GI) conditions, such as celiac disease, Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, can impair absorption in the small intestines, contributing to low B12 levels.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_29-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_31-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-potential-side-effects-and-considerations"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_32-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; Potential Side Effects and Considerations &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_33-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin B12 supplements are well-tolerated and safe for most people. In fact, the Food and Nutrition Board hasn’t set a Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for B12, which is the maximum safe dose unlikely to cause adverse health effects. This is because B12 is water-soluble, so your body uses what it needs and flushes the rest out through your urine. Therefore, even in large doses, B12 is considered safe.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; However, Clark highlights that, on rare occasions, some people experience adverse reactions after taking vitamin B12, including diarrhea and itchy skin.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Caspero adds that there have also been reports of acne-like symptoms when vitamin B12 is taken in large, daily doses over 1000 micrograms.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-the-bottom-line"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text"&gt; The Bottom Line &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Optimal levels of vitamin B12 are required for red blood cell formation, DNA synthesis and to protect nerve fibers. Supplementation is often recommended for those following a &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/291622/the-health-benefits-of-eating-a-plant-based-diet-and-how-to-get-started/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;plant-based eating pattern&lt;/a&gt;, older adults and individuals with digestive conditions. To get the most out of your supplement, dietitians recommend taking it first thing in the morning. However, the most important factor is to remember to take your supplement consistently. Just be sure to consult with your health care provider to discuss potential medication interactions and determine the best form and dosage for your individual needs.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Your stomach can’t break down inulin, she said, so it passes into your intestines undigested.

Carrier eventually switched doctors and says her access to antibiotics changed. Among other things, her new doctor was concerned about antibiotic resistance, which happens when the bacteria no longer responds to certain antibiotics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;“I’d used [antibiotics] probably three times a week for about a year at that point,” she says. Carrier says she was “terrified” that the antibiotics would one day stop working for her. “UTIs were one of the worst things I’ve been through,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;Liz S. also struggles with recurrent UTIs, but has another challenge: She’s allergic to sulfa-based antibiotics, which limits the type of medication she can take. Liz tells Yahoo Life that antibiotic resistance is “definitely a concern, given that I can't take one of the three standard medications.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;In March 2025, the Food and Drug Administration approved a new medication — gepotidacin, sold under the brand name Blujepa — to treat UTIs, making it the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/fda-approves-first-antibiotic-utis-203222927.html" data-ylk="slk:first new antibiotic class in nearly 30 years;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas;outcm:mb_qualified_link;_E:mb_qualified_link;ct:story;" class="link  yahoo-link"&gt;first new antibiotic class in nearly 30 years&lt;/a&gt;.

It’s important to wait for culture results to make sure that you’re given the right antibiotic for your particular infection, Blaser says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finish the entire course of antibiotics. &lt;/strong&gt;Park says it’s important to complete the full course of antibiotics you’re prescribed, even if you start to feel better before then. “This prevents surviving bacteria from developing resistance,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="ml-4 list-disc"&gt;&lt;div class=""&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Try to purchase meat, poultry and dairy products raised without antibiotics when possible. &lt;/strong&gt;“This helps reduce overuse of antibiotics in agriculture, which reduces antimicrobial resistance, especially in zoonotic infections where the bacteria spreads from animals to humans,” Park says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="mb-4 text-lg md:leading-8 break-words"&gt;While Bonomo says several new antibiotics are being researched, he also stresses the importance of doctors and patients working together to fight antibiotic resistance. “We can cut down on the use of antibiotics by a lot and by not prescribing them for things like the common cold,” he says. “I understand that sometimes pressures in the [doctor's] office are very high — people don’t ... a prescription to take Tylenol and orange juice — but we need to do better.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Yahoo</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 09:00:10 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi-AFBVV95cUxOckVXWlJKUEllSDhjeUp0TUQtRzljdFpaMUJvc0Y3TWs5WUpDcy1kNlBiNktPVkNPVlNZdThzWUNfd0hjS0pOeW5fMTZ4RVIycXNSMExqUGdGN093V3U1OWhPSjVYWXJrWndheWlLNXZueEY5MUJPQkFvVUs1ZnJacjMxUUZVN1E2MTBYN3pCRWJwbk1xaEsyV0lwU0tjTWhlYlBXZTVwbE5UaEUtTkhDRHlESmVSNUVReHVndGVFemFQRVJ3Slh3VDdUNzcxbG5RdzlTVF9pNk9HOXZVcUN5WEVwUno4bjVSM0d1Q0lqYWRDZkwzLTRJOQ</guid></item><item><title>关闭CDC肝炎实验室危及美国疫情应对和预防- statnews.com | Closure of CDC hepatitis lab imperils U.S. outbreak response, prevention - statnews.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiiwFBVV95cUxNTXhLMk9VOWw4WkxqWjQ5NmlKR2ZKdGpQamF0WkljMFhTZkxhRVk4ekJvRThqUDBzOGhPMVVPNS1hWlJqa2FCZEJZVFF6SU8wU216OFNjSW5QTzdjQVlxdkpXUWd4ZzBXRWh0NDhveEJ2dWhJWW1sZElGNlRmOFMzMzV2NWZtcmNZRmhn?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="entry-content the-content wp-block-post-content is-layout-flow wp-block-post-content-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimated 4 million Americans are infected with hepatitis C, a disease that can go undetected for years. Another 2.4 million people in this country are chronically infected with hepatitis B, which is the leading cause of liver cancer globally.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis B is preventable, and hepatitis C is curable. But the U.S. capacity to battle these viral scourges has been leveled a devastating blow with the April 1 closure of the country’s premier testing laboratory for viral hepatitis, experts warned. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The lab was one of the targets of this month’s Department of Health and Human Services reductions in force, or RIFs, which slashed about 18% of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s workforce and abruptly terminated many of the public health programs conducted by the Atlanta-based agency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The loss of the CDC’s viral hepatitis lab will leave the country with no good way to measure the scale of the problem it faces with these diseases, they suggested, and less able to find the sources of — and put an end to — outbreaks that can be linked to contaminated food, in the case of hepatitis A, or poor infection control procedures in medical facilities, in the case of hepatitis B and C. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Without [the lab] we won’t have any idea of what the distribution of viral hepatitis is in the U.S.,” said Chari Cohen, president of the Hepatitis B Foundation, a nonprofit that focuses on finding a cure and improving the quality of life for people living with hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;The preponderance of the CDC cuts were in the areas of chronic disease, environmental health, and injury prevention, with many of the infectious diseases teams at the agency emerging relatively intact so far. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite that, the 27 full-time workers who staffed the viral hepatitis laboratory in the National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention were among those axed. Colleagues who work on surveillance and hepatitis control were saved, but will be forced to conduct their work without the evidence generated by their lab, which provided critical data to help them pinpoint the source of outbreaks or revise control policy when needed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Without the lab, public health officials working to stop transmission of hepatitis viruses are like police officers trying to solve a crime without the capacity to analyze fingerprints or test for the DNA of the perpetrator.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“They’re one of the only labs in the world who did the kind of specimen analysis that they did. Highly, highly specialized molecular analysis of viral hepatitis samples,” Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;David Margolius, director of public health for the city of Cleveland, suggested closing the CDC’s hepatitis lab is self-defeating.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s not saving money. It’s setting us backwards,” Margolius told STAT in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“The most recent year of analysis of hepatitis C showed the first decline in nationwide cases for the first time in years, and there is a cure for hepatitis C, which is relatively new. And so with effort and leadership from the federal government, we could end the hepatitis C epidemic in our country and cure everybody,” he said. “It’s a small investment for a big payoff.”&lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis is an umbrella term for inflammation of the liver, which can be caused by a variety of things. But a handful of viruses, known as hepatitis A through E, are common causes of the condition, and the targets of study of the recently shuttered lab. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hepatitis A and E are transmitted through what’s known as the fecal-oral route, meaning &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/outbreaks/frozen-strawberries-2023/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;something contaminated&lt;/a&gt; with the virus is ingested. Hepatitis B and C are spread through bodily fluids, with B most commonly passing from an infected person to their baby during childbirth, and C associated with sharing needles during injected drug use, or improperly sterilized medical equipment. Hepatitis B, C, and D can also be transmitted during sex, though that is less common for C.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some people infected with these viruses will clear the infection on their own. But for some people, hepatitis B and C infections become chronic, and eventually life-threatening. There is no cure for hepatitis B, though there is an effective vaccine, which is supposed to be given to newborns to prevent infection at birth. The younger one is when infected with hepatitis B, the higher the chance that the infection will become chronic, potentially leading to liver damage, cirrhosis, or liver cancer. People who develop chronic hepatitis B face a lifetime of medication to control their illness. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the key hurdles in preventing transmission of these viruses is that many people who are infected do not know it. And without the CDC lab, estimating how many infections there are nationally and where transmission is most intense may no longer be possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Commercial laboratories that process tests for clinicians and hospitals generate some data, but tallies based on them only count the infections that have come to the medical community’s attention. They cannot be used to calculate how many people are infected and unaware of that fact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The way those estimates have been generated has been through the CDC lab, which every two years tests a nationally representative number of samples from people who take part in the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey&lt;/a&gt;, known as NHANES. Those findings are used to estimate the prevalence of hepatitis A through E among Americans. &lt;/p&gt;





&lt;p&gt;One of the impacted staff from the viral hepatitis division, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, said the lab group was just about to begin analyzing the most recent round of NHANES specimens when the lab was closed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“We are now blind to a lot of these things. You can’t develop a response if you don’t know your burden. And you can’t pick up hot spots,” said Su Wang, an internal medicine specialist in Florham Park, N.J., whose practice treats many viral hepatitis patients and who is on the board of the Hepatitis B Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cohen said trends in infections could perhaps be estimated by studying large datasets from private labs, “but they’re never going to give you a picture of what’s happening overall.” &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The lab’s closure comes at a time when there are multiple outbreaks in the country, at &lt;a href="https://www.masslive.com/news/2025/03/baystate-wing-hospital-patients-urged-to-test-for-hepatitis-hiv-after-sterilization-issue.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;least two&lt;/a&gt; of which are associated with &lt;a href="https://www.floridatoday.com/story/news/local/2025/03/22/florida-surgeon-general-ladapo-emergency-restriction-melbourne-doctor-hepatitis-c-cluster/82544616007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;medical facilities&lt;/a&gt;. Finding out that cases are linked — and figuring out how the infections took place — is crucial to determining if a clinic or hospital is failing on infection control, said the CDC worker who asked not to be named. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“It’s important for the authorities to know this clinic or this particular facility really is responsible for having this pathogen transmitted because they have a breach in infection control practices,” the individual said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Determining that cases are linked requires a laboratory to generate genetic sequences of viruses from a variety of cases and compare the sequences. This is not something commercial labs can be expected to do, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Yes, they can receive a diagnosis from any commercial lab,” the individual said. “But whether they are part of the same transmission cluster, whether they got infected at the same facility or they got infected elsewhere, that information they cannot get from a health department. They cannot get this information from any commercial lab. Because there’s no money to be made there.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The closure also comes as the lab was making big strides in developing a point-of-care test for hepatitis C, something that has long been needed and does not exist anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Testing for hepatitis C is currently a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-c/about/index.html#cdc_disease_basics_testing_screening-screening-testing-and-diagnosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;two-step process&lt;/a&gt;. A single blood draw that could determine on the spot whether a person is infected would be a game-changer, especially now that there are direct-acting antiviral pills that are effectively a cure. “This is a significant need in our field so that you can identify those millions of individuals and they can benefit from this treatment,” said the CDC employee. Work on the test was &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jcm.00771-23" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;progressing positively&lt;/a&gt;, though it still needed fine-tuning. Where that work goes now is unknown, the person said. “In the middle of it, it is all shut down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

You might want to try Pilates instead if you're serious about core strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-1" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This low-impact exercise focuses on slow, controlled movements that put the core muscles under constant tension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the practice engages the deep core muscles surrounding the spine, which include abdominal, back and pelvic floor muscles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there’s one beginner-friendly core Pilates move everyone can do: the tabletop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This is a move that people overlook, but it will help you build deep abdominal engagement and it teaches you how to control your breath,” explains Rachel Lennon, a Pilates instructor and the founder of &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/wellnesstribe_studio/?igsh=ZXl1a2w2ZjV3dGpm#" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/wellnesstribe_studio/?igsh=ZXl1a2w2ZjV3dGpm#" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;The Wellness Tribe studio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/wellnesstribe_retreat/?igsh=MW82cWI2ZGd3ZXJlZg%3D%3D#" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.instagram.com/wellnesstribe_retreat/?igsh=MW82cWI2ZGd3ZXJlZg%3D%3D#" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;retreats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="ad-unit-2" class="ad-unit"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It's a foundational move for your core, which will help you build amazing control.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-do-tabletop"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to do tabletop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet planted on the ground. Arms by your side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Inhale, then as you exhale lift your right leg, then your left, so that your shins are parallel with the ground at a 90° angle. Your knees should be in line with the hips.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hold for 30 seconds or longer, to make it more challenging.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To make it more difficult, bring your hands behind your head and crunch for ten to 12 times, exhaling as you crunch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proper form is really important for this exercise. &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/how-to-engage-your-core" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/how-to/how-to-engage-your-core"&gt;To ensure your core is completely engaged&lt;/a&gt;, keep your back flat on the mat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div id="slice-container-newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qBnHf5ft4Wvi2DhA3RXEKg" class="slice-container newsletter-inbodyContent-slice newsletterForm-articleInbodyContent-qBnHf5ft4Wvi2DhA3RXEKg slice-container-newsletterForm"&gt;&lt;div data-hydrate="true" class="newsletter-form__wrapper newsletter-form__wrapper--inbodyContent"&gt;&lt;div class="newsletter-form__container"&gt;&lt;section class="newsletter-form__main-section"&gt;&lt;p class="newsletter-form__strapline"&gt;Start your week with achievable workout ideas, health tips and wellbeing advice in your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Keep your tailbone tucked under and think about getting your belly button to your spine,” Lennon advises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If it feels like your core isn't engaged, bring the knees a little bit closer towards your chest” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to make this exercise more challenging, Lennon recommends extending your legs straight out so they hover above the floor or adding ankle weights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-benefits-of-tabletop"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The benefits of tabletop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might not immediately feel the burn when holding the tabletop, like you do during a plank, but this move is activating those deep core muscles—a learned behavior that will serve you well during other exercises such as squats and deadlifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning to activate your core will make these exercises feel easier, and also help to protect your lower back and improve your posture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lennon recommends starting your workouts with tabletop to activate your core.

    &lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;But when the mom-of-two walked into the house she was horrified to find Elynn on the floor with a 'bulging' face and 'flat' head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Fearing for her daughter's life, Jordan rushed her to hospital where a CT scan confirmed she had suffered &lt;a target="_self" class="" href="/news/article-14334287/Father-accused-googling-make-child-disabled-bid-newborn-son-brain-damage-claim-benefits-family-court-case.html"&gt;multiple skull fractures and a brain injury&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Elynn was then life-flighted to a children's hospital in Milwaukee, &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/wisconsin/index.html" id="mol-0aa87ee0-155a-11f0-85a1-67e81e2aff15"&gt;Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt;, for further emergency treatment. She was put into a medically induced coma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;At the time, the 28-year-old mom said Vincent claimed he had accidentally dropped their daughter while trying to give her a bottle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Jordan said Vincent was arrested and she claims she was told by Child Protective Services and a detective told that he had deliberately dropped Elynn. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Today Elynn is disabled and has learning difficulties, and Jordan is sharing her story to raise awareness of the permanent damage Vincent caused his daughter and the life-changing affects his actions have had on her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A little over a year later, Vincent was sentenced to 10 years in prison in April 2021 for child abuse-recklessly causing great bodily harm and neglecting a child causing great bodily harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;The three-month-old had suffered multiple skull fractures and brain damage &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Recalling the chain of events, Jordan said: 'I got into the house and Elynn was on the floor playing and Carl was playing in his room and my now ex-husband was sitting on the couch waiting for me to come home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I knew something was wrong. I'm looking at my children and that's when he picks up Elynn and shows me her face. The side of her face was bulging out and the back of her head was flat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'She was very pale and not responsive and her eyes were ticking back to the left repeatedly, she was having seizures the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I looked at my ex-husband as I was really scared. Vincent told me his version of events that happened. He told me that he was holding her and said he dropped her by accident while he was making her a bottle as she was squirming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At the time, I put myself in a protective mode as I needed to get my daughter out of there safely and to the hospital without him trying to stop me as my daughter was dying.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;According to the criminal complaint, Children’s Wisconsin in Wauwatosa called police on because Elynn had significant head trauma.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After being questioned by CPS and a detective at the hospital, Jordan was allowed to go and see her daughter and Vincent was arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jordan said: 'They [the CPS and detective] understood immediately that I had nothing to do with it [and] the detective took me upstairs to go and see my daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I got into her room and I looked at her and puked. It was the worst image I had ever seen in my life. At that moment I was scared my daughter was going to die.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Elynn remained in the hospital for a month and was discharged February 7, 2020, but she has since had to undergo three major surgeries due to the extent of her injuries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jordan said: 'Elynn has beaten all the odds. Considering what she's been through, she is a very happy child'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jordan said the doctors weren't sure Elynn was going to survive. She was experiencing frequent seizures and had to undergo a surgery to drain fluid from around her brain.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After having drains placed, Elynn began to open her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jordan said: 'When she opened her eyes, this was the first sign that I knew my daughter was going to be okay. She then continued to get stronger and stronger each day.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Elynn remained in the hospital for a month and was discharged February 7, 2020, but she has since had to undergo additional major surgeries due to the extent of her injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Despite 'beating the odds,' Jordan says her ex-husband's actions have completely changed her daughter's life and she's glad he's now in prison. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;A court case report shows Vincent, who was 25 at the time, was sentenced to 10 years in prison, plus a five-year extended supervision, as well as probation of three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;In the court sentencing, Vincent was quoted by his defense attorney who said he claims he dropped Elynn as he believed this would 'maybe get her to stop crying.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Vincent (right) was sentenced to 10 years in prison in April 2021 for child abuse-recklessly causing great bodily harm and neglecting a child causing great bodily harm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Jordan said her daughter couldn't walk for a long time and had to undergo leg surgery&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jordan said: 'I had spoken to [Vincent] three times on the phone that day and had texted him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'At this point [before I got home], I wasn't worried about him being at home on his own with the kids. He is their father and had never shown any physical signs to hurt anyone before.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;However, Jordan said Vincent was 'a very angry person.'  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jordan said: 'It was almost easy for me to accept what he did because I already knew that he did it deep down on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's been my life for so many years and I have to face the consequences every day with my daughter being disabled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The brain injury was on the left side of her brain so this affected her entire right side of her body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The only thing she doesn't have issues with on her right side is her hearing. She can't see her peripheral or lower peripheral vision on her right side and we are learning what she can and can't see.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jordan said Elynn has cerebral palsy and is behind her peers learning-wise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;The mom also said she was getting Elynn evaluated for autism because of how her injury has affected her brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Jordan added: 'She couldn't walk for a long time and it was only in August last year that she had a second surgery on her leg to help her walk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The excitement I had when she started being able to walk was one of the most emotional parts of my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I had been waiting years for this and I didn't think she would ever walk. She is a bit unsteady on her feet but she can finally get up and play with her brother. She has a really bad limp though. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I feel I have got justice. I don't want him [Vincent] to ever see them [Elynn and Carl] and he won't be getting out for 20 years so I feel accomplished and like I have protected my children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'Elynn has beaten all the odds. Considering what she's been through, she is a very happy child.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

'I really, really regret having gotten the vaccine.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kelly, who recently launched a new podcast network called MK Media, said she received two &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/pfizer/index.html" id="mol-8b29fa80-17bc-11f0-8d9a-5714ff75a0c3"&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt; jabs in 2020 and then an additional booster at the recommendation of her doctors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;She lamented that she felt compelled to take the shots because it was difficult going out during the pandemic in &lt;a target="_self" href="/news/new_york/index.html" id="mol-8b2cb9a0-17bc-11f0-8d9a-5714ff75a0c3"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt;, where she lived at the time, without proof of vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'You could get the fake cards, but it was hard. I didn't know how to do it,' said Kelly, who was 50 when she was first immunized against COVID. 'So, I trusted my doctors and I did it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Kelly, who went public first announced her vaccine complications on an episode of her podcast in February, said that within months of getting the booster shot, she tested positive for an autoimmune condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Her rheumatologist reportedly speculated the malady could have been a result of Kelly receiving multiple jabs and then contracting COVID.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;Podcasting queen Megyn Kelly gave the Daily Mail an exclusive update on her health, after revealing a doctor's shock diagnosis that she may be suffering from a side-effect of the COVID-19 vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="artSplitter mol-img-group"&gt;  &lt;p class="imageCaption"&gt;'You could get the fake cards, but it was hard. I didn't know how to do it,' said Kelly, who was 50 when she was first immunized against COVID. 'So, I trusted my doctors and I did it.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'I said [to the rheumatologist], could it be that I had the third shot - and then within a month of it, got the Omicron version,' Kelly recalled. 'And she said, yes.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'It's an unfortunate thing. You can't undo the past,' Kelly said, conceding that there have been 'worse' outcomes experienced by other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'But we were lied to,' she continued, criticizing the establishment for not warning the public about potential risks. 'It was not an informed assumption of the risk.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Severe side-effects attributed to the COVID vaccine have been documented, such as allergic reactions and anaphylaxis. The Centers for Disease Control has also noted other complications, such as myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, or pericarditis, inflammation of the heart lining, as well as an autoimmune disease called Guillain-Barre Syndrome, which affects the nerves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Of course, the COVID vaccine has also been credited with saving millions of lives globally. But there are growing, yet-unanswered questions over whether the vaccine should have been pushed so aggressively on young and healthy individuals, who were not at particular risk to adverse outcomes from the COVID virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Early-stage research out of Yale University also suggested a link between mRNA immunization and 'post-vaccination syndrome,' (PVS) which could cause exercise intolerance, insomnia, brain fog and dizziness. The study, published as a pre-print in February, reported that PVS could potentially contribute to autoimmunity or tissue damage – and even reawake the dormant Epstein-Barr virus in the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's no question people have been hurt and even killed,' claimed Kell. 'I, for one, have learned a ton, but remain pissed off about how the whole thing was handled.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Dr. Aseem Malhotra - a cardiologist, who has faced backlash for his vaccine skepticism, previously told the Daily Mail that he was diagnosed with psoriasis, speculating that it was linked to the COVID jab. He praised Kelly in February for bringing her health scare to light on her podcast – on which he also appeared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'The fact that one of the United States' most popular public figures only just opened up about being vaccine-injured, feeling safe to discuss it with a doctor who understands the situation, suggests that many, perhaps millions of Americans are suffering in silence,' he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;After the success of 'The Megyn Kelly Podcast,' Kelly launched her latest venture last month - MK Media, a video and audio podcast network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Among the first three hosts to join her network is the Daily Mail's columnist Maureen Callahan, who Kelly lauded as 'clever.' She championed Callahan's 'unique' perspectives, calling her 'a cultural maven.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;'There's just no one better,' Kelly previously said. 'God help you if she turns her pen against you -- it's going to be so fun for the rest of us, though.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="mol-para-with-font"&gt;Callahan will host a show titled, 'The Nerve' which will launch this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Daily Mail</author><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2025 03:50:30 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMihwFBVV95cUxNaFgxQXFEb3lBY2VSaG95eGk1eWVpNmhod0V6X1ozRTNLREQ4aE53bm45QkhzcHMzcUJEbUc4cXUxWHJaMTVjcFc3bWdWTkgwT3JZSVlONjFuLXNiVS1vN2Vrd3ZMT3BXMDQ5UVFndU1Ld3dOU0pzcnRQSUtRVDRkMzZVbWZuYWc</guid></item><item><title>糙米真的更健康吗？令人震惊的研究揭示了隐藏的风险- SciTechDaily | Is Brown Rice Really Healthier?

&lt;p&gt;MONTE VISTA, Colo. (KRDO) - Colorado Parks and Wildlife announces multiple raccoons have tested positive for canine distemper in recent weeks in Alamosa and Monte Vista.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A raccoon carcass from Monte Vista is the only confirmed case at this time, however, two raccoons from Alamosa show symptoms consistent with canine distemper, but official testing is still needed.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;CPW says animals with canine distemper often have difficulty moving and can act abnormally because of brain infections. Crusting around the eyes and/or nose is commonly observed, while other signs such as coughing, diarrhea, vomiting, and thickened paw pads tend to be less obvious. Sick animals usually do not survive. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The virus is contagious and can spread to your pet at home. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CPW recommends you get your pets vaccinated and keep them away from any wild animals. In addition to raccoons, coyotes, foxes, skunks, and other carnivores can contract the virus.&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;“We’ve had a number of reports, and one we submitted for testing did already come back positive for distemper,” said CPW District Wildlife Manager Tyler Cerny of Monte Vista. “In these cases, any other raccoon in the area exhibiting symptoms is presumed to be positive for canine distemper. We are continuing to see more cases.”&lt;/p&gt;




&lt;p&gt;If you think your animal has canine distemper, take them to get tested for rabies. CPW says distemper cannot be distinguished from rabies without brain testing.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;When a pregnant woman had her blood sampled back in 1972, doctors discovered it was mysteriously missing a surface molecule found on all other known &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/red-blood-cells-play-a-much-greater-role-in-our-immune-system-than-we-thought"&gt;red blood cells&lt;/a&gt; at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 50 years, this strange molecular absence finally led to researchers from the UK and Israel describing a new&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/why-do-we-have-blood-types"&gt; blood group system&lt;/a&gt; in humans. In 2024, the team published their paper on the discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It represents a huge achievement, and the culmination of a long team effort, to finally establish this new blood group system and be able to offer the best care to rare, but important, patients," UK National Health Service hematologist Louise Tilley &lt;a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2024/september/blood-group.html"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; last September, after nearly 20 years of personally researching this bloody quirk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we're all more familiar with the ABO blood group system and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rh_factor_testing"&gt;Rh factor&lt;/a&gt; (that's the plus or minus part), humans actually have &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_blood_group_systems"&gt;many different blood group systems&lt;/a&gt; based on the wide variety of cell-surface proteins and sugars that coat our blood cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our bodies use these antigen molecules, amongst their other purposes, as identification markers to separate 'self' from potentially harmful not-selves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_140271" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-140271" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/MajorBloodTypesChart642.jpg" alt="Diagram of ABO blood groups and the IgM antibodies present in each." class="size-full wp-image-140271" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/MajorBloodTypesChart642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/10/MajorBloodTypesChart642-600x386.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-140271" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Blood type (or blood group) is determined, in part, by the ABO blood group antigens present on red blood cells.  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/antibody" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73081" data-postid="158063" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Antibodies&lt;/a&gt; in our blood plasma detect when a foreign antigen marker is present.&lt;span&gt; (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/ABO_blood_type.svg"&gt;InvictaHOG/Public Domain/Wikimedia Commons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;If these markers do not match up when receiving a blood transfusion, this life-saving tactic can &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482202/"&gt;cause reactions or even end up being fatal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most major blood groups were identified early in the 20th century. Many discovered since, like the Er blood system &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/discovery-of-a-new-rare-blood-type-could-save-the-lives-of-future-newborns"&gt;first described by researchers in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, only impact a small number of people. This is also the case for the new blood group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The work was difficult because the genetic cases are very rare," &lt;a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2024/september/blood-group.html"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; Tilley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_148174" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-148174" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/BloodTransfusion642.jpg" alt="A person's arm with a cannula, receiving a blood transfusion" class="size-full wp-image-148174" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/BloodTransfusion642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/BloodTransfusion642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/01/BloodTransfusion642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-148174" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Transfusion reactions can be severe. (&lt;a href="https://www.canva.com/photos/MAFagVIxPSo/"&gt;Africa images/Canva&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous research found more than 99.9 percent of people have the AnWj antigen that was missing from the 1972 patient's blood. This antigen lives on a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAL_(gene)"&gt;myelin and lymphocyte protein&lt;/a&gt;, leading the researchers to call the newly described system the MAL blood group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone has a mutated version of both copies of their &lt;em&gt;MAL&lt;/em&gt; genes, they end up with an AnWj-negative blood type, like the pregnant patient. Tilley and team identified three patients with the rare blood type that didn't have this mutation, suggesting that sometimes blood disorders can also cause the antigen to be suppressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"MAL is a very small protein with some interesting properties which made it difficult to identify and meant we needed to pursue multiple lines of investigation to accumulate the proof we needed to establish this blood group system," &lt;a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2024/september/blood-group.html"&gt;explained&lt;/a&gt; University of the West of England cell biologist Tim Satchwell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine they had the correct gene, after decades of research, the team inserted the normal &lt;em&gt;MAL&lt;/em&gt; gene into blood cells that were AnWj-negative. This effectively delivered the AnWj antigen to those cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MAL protein is known to play a vital role in keeping cell membranes stable and aiding in cell transport. What's more, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1537-2995.1988.28388219164.x"&gt;previous research found&lt;/a&gt; that the AnWj isn't actually present in newborn babies but appears soon after birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, all the AnWj-negative patients included in the study shared the same mutation. However, no other cell abnormalities or diseases were found to be associated with this mutation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the researchers have identified the genetic markers behind the &lt;em&gt;MAL&lt;/em&gt; mutation, patients can be tested to see if their negative MAL blood type is inherited or due to suppression, which could be a sign of another underlying medical problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These rare blood quirks can have &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/discovery-of-a-new-rare-blood-type-could-save-the-lives-of-future-newborns"&gt;devastating impacts on patients&lt;/a&gt;, so the more of them we can understand, the more lives can be saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This research was published in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2024025099"&gt;Blood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in September 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Even better: you don’t even have to clock 10,000 steps a day or be a fast walker to see a benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical activity seems to be the ultimate multitasking move for improved health. It’s already been linked to a wide variety of benefits, from a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6557987/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:healthier heart;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;healthier heart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10503965/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:higher-quality sleep;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;higher-quality sleep&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1136900/full" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:less anxiety;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;less anxiety&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/health/wellness/a63655358/walk-to-live-longer-study/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:longer life;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;longer life&lt;/a&gt;. This new study signals that cancer prevention might deserve a spot on the list of exercise perks as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how much do you really need to walk to lower your risk of cancer? And how fast do your feet need to move? To find out exactly what this new research says about the link between exercise and cancer risk, we reached out to the lead author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the researchers did&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, scientists took data from the &lt;a href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:UK Biobank;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;UK Biobank&lt;/a&gt; study in which more than 85,000 adults wore devices that tracked their total daily activity, activity intensity and daily step count for a week. After an average of 5.8 years passed, 2,633 of the participants had been diagnosed with one of 13 types of cancer. The researchers then crunched all the numbers and adjusted for at least nine major cancer risk factors (such as smoking, drinking alcohol and eating red meat) to figure out how a person’s physical activity might lower their risk of developing cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What the study found&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People who walked an average of 7,000 steps per day had a 11% lower risk of cancer than those who only took 5,000 daily steps. Those with a daily step count of 9,000 had a 16% lower risk.&lt;/strong&gt; Surprisingly, it doesn’t seem like walking more than 9,000 steps will amplify the cancer-prevention benefits much. “Above this level, it was not clear if the risk reductions linked to higher step counts were statistically different,” says &lt;a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/fellowship-experience/meet-fellows/meb/shreves-alaina" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Alaina Shreves, M.S.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Alaina Shreves, M.S.&lt;/a&gt;, a predoctoral fellow in the Metabolic Epidemiology Branch of the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health and the lead author of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slow walkers, rejoice! One of the most interesting (and exciting!) findings to come out of this research is that &lt;strong&gt;you don’t have to be a power walker to lower your risk of cancer. “The pace of the steps — step intensity — seemed to be less important,” says Shreves.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does exercise help lower your risk of cancer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers aren’t exactly sure why physical activity seems to have a protective effect against cancer, but there are some theories. “For example, exercise can bring about &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11591795/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:beneficial changes in hormones;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;beneficial changes in hormones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-025-86306-2&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Fhealth%2Ffitness%2Fa64433049%2Fstudy-walking-lower-cancer-risk%2F" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:improve insulin sensitivity;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link"&gt;improve insulin sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6962351/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lower inflammation;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lower inflammation&lt;/a&gt; and may &lt;a href="https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/007165.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:improve immune function;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;improve immune function&lt;/a&gt;,” says Shreves. On top of that, she notes, long-term efforts to reduce sitting time in favor of increased activity have found improvements in &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5999077/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:waist measurements, body fat;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;waist measurements, body fat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3329818/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blood sugar and insulin levels;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;blood sugar and insulin levels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.atherosclerosis-journal.com/article/S0021-9150(25)00040-1/fulltext" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:cholesterol;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;cholesterol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7343526/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blood pressure;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially, exercise is good for so many parts of your body that it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cancer-protecting mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does this mean for future research?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get an even better idea of how exercise may help prevent cancer, “future studies should explore how physical activity affects the risk of specific types of cancer,” Shreves says. For instance, maybe it has a bigger impact on a person’s risk of say, prostate cancer than lung cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with most studies, more research is needed to confirm the results, but these results are promising. &lt;strong&gt;“Increasing your daily physical activity may help reduce the risk of certain cancers, regardless of the intensity of the activity,” says Shreves. “Find activities you enjoy, like walking your dog or taking a stroll, and stay active!”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 21:20:58 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMidkFVX3lxTE1xRDJYU19adjZSVDdJUnBKM0pHTHFkQTM1d0Y1ajZ3eEJNRDF0Z0VRRDlpTkJNUHBPUW5lLTltdGNBNDhRRUE4VXNfcS1KdmNNd05OaVUyUWgwTXpCSHpxUEhYeEVjTUZGMExqOHgyQ0lSQWJoNVE</guid></item><item><title>医生说他们找到了一种方法来清除体内的微塑料-未来主义 | Doctors Say They’ve Found a Way to Clean the Microplastics Out of Your Body - Futurism</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic0FVX3lxTE1ZNUd5Vzh4MXhnWnYxdl9SRlNQdGQyak0yem5tTXJEVGxDWUczOGRpamRWaWNmanE3YXVWajJwWTR1RkJ2cVpkaUFZYjZrRkxoX3hCZ2hxM0VwQ2Zia1VhMTE2bGFDcHU4a3BETlc0NUN4aFk?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;section id="incArticle" class="post-content z-50 w-full p-3 space-y-4 bg-white border lg:-mt-6 md:p-4 md:border-gray-900 lg:ml-3 lg:w-2/3 font-b text-3"&gt;&lt;div class="space-y-4 lg:space-y-0"&gt;&lt;p class="block text-xs text-gray-500 uppercase lg:hidden font-c"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Image by Peter Dazeley via Getty / Futurism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A high-end medical practice is offering clients the purported service of scrubbing their blood of microplastics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/this-startup-promises-to-clean-your-blood-of-microplastics-clarify-clinics/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Clarify Clinics CEO Yael Cohen said that her London facility's &lt;a href="https://clarifyclinics.com/what-we-do/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;bespoke blood-filtering service&lt;/a&gt; — which is otherwise known as apheresis and generally &lt;a href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/apheresis" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;used for plasma donation&lt;/a&gt; or other so-called &lt;a href="https://www.saintlukeskc.org/health-library/understanding-therapeutic-plasma-exchange-tpe" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;therapeutic plasma exchange&lt;/a&gt; procedures — is so comfortable that some patients doze off during it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once it’s running, you feel nothing. It’s very comfortable," Cohen told the magazine of its Clari procedure, which costs more than $12,000 &lt;a href="https://clarifyclinics.com/book/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;per session&lt;/a&gt;.

While studies in recent years have established links between microplastics and &lt;a href="https://hull-repository.worktribe.com/output/3883618/a-rapid-review-and-meta-regression-analyses-of-the-toxicological-impacts-of-microplastic-exposure-in-human-cells" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;damage to human cells&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2309822" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;hearts&lt;/a&gt;, that research was all, as &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; notes, observational. Thus far, the only thing we know definitively is that these mysterious particles have been found &lt;a href="https://magazine.hms.harvard.edu/articles/microplastics-everywhere" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;nearly everywhere researchers have looked&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/24/microplastics-found-in-human-blood-for-first-time" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;our blood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://hscnews.unm.edu/news/microplastics-in-organs" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;guts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/brains-microplastics-study" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;brains&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/25/uk/microplastics-archeological-remains-study-scli-intl-scn-gbr/index.html" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;archaeological digs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/microplastics-found-near-everests-peak-highest-ever-detected-world-perpetual-planet" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;Mount Everest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While there don't appear to be any studies about the &lt;a href="https://clarifyclinics.com/science/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;effectiveness of the Clari procedure&lt;/a&gt;, there's a pretty strong body of evidence suggesting that therapeutic plasma exchange in general is a &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5620780/" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;safe and effective treatment&lt;/a&gt; for some &lt;a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/24197-plasmapheresis-plasma-exchange" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;autoimmune and neurological disorders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a similar vein, the desire to get those foreign and synthetic particulates out of one's blood, and to clean one's blood in general, makes some degree of sense. According to Cohen, longevity influencer Bryan Johnson's interest in so-called "&lt;a href="https://x.com/bryan_johnson/status/1845950287032492378?lang=en" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;total plasma exchange&lt;/a&gt;" — a more extreme apheresis procedure he used to &lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/bryan-johnson-young-blood-son" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;get his son's blood filtered into his own&lt;/a&gt; — where all of the body's plasma is removed and replaced with proteins and antibodies, has been a big boon for her business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He’s a big platform, and he is spending a lot of time and energy finding the things that move the needle the most," the CEO said of Johnson, a former &lt;em&gt;Futurism &lt;/em&gt;investor who's no longer involved with the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though it doesn't appear that &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; shelled out for its reporter, Matt Reynolds, to get his blood scrubbed, the journalist did get his microplastics levels tested to see what the fuss was about. In a fingerprick &lt;span&gt;sample of&lt;/span&gt; blood, Reynolds had about 190 microplastic particles per millimeter, which is apparently on the lower end of the scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pleased with the results, the reporter emailed Cohen. In response, she pointed out the stark truth: that he still has "around a million particles in [his] circulatory system!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More on microplastics:  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://futurism.com/neoscope/chewing-gum-microplastics" class="underline hover:text-neoscope hover:no-underline transition-all duration-200 ease-in-out"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chewing Gum Is Flooding Your Mouth With Microplastics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Futurism</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 21:15:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMic0FVX3lxTE1ZNUd5Vzh4MXhnWnYxdl9SRlNQdGQyak0yem5tTXJEVGxDWUczOGRpamRWaWNmanE3YXVWajJwWTR1RkJ2cVpkaUFZYjZrRkxoX3hCZ2hxM0VwQ2Zia1VhMTE2bGFDcHU4a3BETlc0NUN4aFk</guid></item><item><title>末日滚动背后的科学--以及如何阻止它--《泰晤士报》 | The science behind doomscrolling — and how to stop it - The Times</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMilgFBVV95cUxQM0s4cW9lMUdHRFY4dDRSRHNkb0N0TjlOZi1fa041VjlYLVowUmczZnlFMzJucjBVX1VZbEt3QWlhRnkxQVdwTm8yNWt2ZlhKQWZocUhPSVJXV25hblJCZlo1SnFTcnh0TGVJVlVYTktraU5obzFHLUx4VWRKVHVnZXpDSnVBY1Y2SEc5NzBNdXI0OXhGM3c?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__ArticleContent-sc-15gvuj2-8 kuowVf"&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;&lt;span class="responsive__DropCap-sc-1pktst5-1 enuiNL"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;here has been, you may have noticed, no shortage of bad news lately. Wars rumble on, markets teeter, ice caps retreat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Some of us respond in a way that feels almost instinctive — we reach for our phones, we refresh late into the night, we obsessively absorb new details. The habit has acquired a name: doomscrolling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Coined during the pandemic, when new crises seemed to unfold by the hour, the term describes the compulsion to trawl through endless bleak headlines on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;So why does bad news have such a grip on us? And how can we loosen it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;&lt;b&gt;A quirk of evolution&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;At its core, doomscrolling appears to exploit a quirk of human psychology — our built-in bias for negativity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Evolutionarily, being alive&lt;span&gt; to danger helped our ancestors survive. When early humans roamed the African savannah, those attuned to potential threats — say, the rustle of a predator in the undergrowth — stood a better chance of survival. A false positive (panicking at the wind) was preferable to a false negative (ignoring a lion).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Journalists have long understood this tendency. “If it bleeds, it leads,” runs the old newsroom adage, born of the intuition that tales of bloodshed and calamity shift more papers than good news ever could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;In the digital age, the “lion in the grass” that hijacks our attention might be a lurid post about war, recession or ecological collapse. Individuals with high levels of neuroticism — an inheritable personality trait — appear particularly vulnerable, says Professor Christopher Ferguson of Stetson University. So too do those with low tolerance for uncertainty, who seek definitive answers in a chaotic world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Could bad news fuel bad health?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div id="8.3"&gt;&lt;div id="ac728863-6345-4402-b877-9b344a3cf476"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 responsive__FullWidthImg-sc-4v1r4q-4 jGJovF"&gt;&lt;div class="responsive__FullWidthCaptionContainer-sc-1io40fc-3 hADFiz"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;div class="tc-view__TcView-nuazoi-0 fPjBcr"&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;Scientists are investigating whether doomscrolling causes chronic, low-grade inflammation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="tc-text__TcText-sc-15igzev-0 kwFxdN"&gt;GETTY IMAGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Doomscrolling resembles rumination — the repetitive, unproductive dwelling on dark thoughts. The science is still emerging, but some studies suggest a link between &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/doom-scrolling-really-does-make-you-more-depressed-study-finds-2gnxvm99d" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;heavy social media use and depression&lt;/a&gt;, anxiety and lower life satisfaction. Whether it is the scrolling that stokes low moods or that people who already feel unhappy tend to spend more time online is not clear. Many researchers suspect it is a bit of both, but if doomscrolling robs you of sleep, it is unlikely to improve your frame of mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;The effects may also be physical. Dr Dan Nicolau of King’s College London, is investigating whether the compulsive consumption of bad news primes the body’s immune system for a battle that never comes. Early results suggest links between heavy social media use and elevated levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation found in the blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Inflammation, in small doses, can be a good thing. It helps fight infection and repair injury. If you are about to square off with a big cat, it makes sense for your body to be prepared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;However, in the modern world — sitting on a sofa, doomscrolling through disasters — this ancient defence mechanism may be misfiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Nicolau suspects that doomscrolling can lead the body to brace for physical trauma that never arrives, resulting in chronic, low-grade inflammation — the physiological equivalent of sleeping in your boots for a war that’s forever just over the horizon. This kind of smouldering, low-grade inflammation has been linked to a host of diseases, from &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/map-brain-watershed-neuroscience-mice-787r0nbpl" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;Alzheimer’s&lt;/a&gt; to arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Meanwhile, conditions such as depression and schizophrenia, long assumed to be purely neurological, are now thought to have inflammatory components. Whether inflammation helps cause these illnesses or merely accompanies them is unclear, but the two are increasingly hard to separate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="responsive__Heading2-sc-4v1r4q-9 bQMpmd"&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to stop scrolling?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Addiction, says Nicolau, is often as much about anticipation as it is about consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;For an alcoholic, mood-boosting hormones will surge before the first sip, he explained. Simply being exposed to certain environmental cues — say, the clink of glasses — can drive these pleasure responses close to their peak levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;“In effect, addicts get much of the biochemical high without the substance,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;• &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/midlife-social-media-addict-advice-stop-vk8x79tgw" class="link__RespLink-sc-1ocvixa-0 csWvlP"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Midlife social media addict? Here’s what to do&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If similar mechanisms underlie compulsive digital behaviours, putting distance between yourself and your phone is the obvious first step. That might mean charging it in another room or turning it off overnight. Removing shortcuts to certain apps from your home screen might help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Other options include apps that promise to make it harder for you to waste time on other apps. There are digital tools that require users to solve a maths puzzle before launching a compulsive platform like TikTok. The aim is to buy a moment of clarity — to realise: “Actually, I’d rather be doing something else.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;Ferguson said: “Social media use and smartphone use should be fun for the most part. So the first thing is to notice, are you having fun?” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;If the answer is “no” it can be helpful to have “a cognitive plan”. Some people find it useful to have an image or a catchphrase that they can call to mind: “Something that jolts them to disengage.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="last-paragraph" class="responsive__Paragraph-sc-1pktst5-0 gaEeqC"&gt;His final tip? Don’t doomscroll about doomscrolling. “It’s healthy to reflect on our relationship with technology,” he said. “Just try not to panic while doing it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p id="paywall-portal-article-footer"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 21:00:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMilgFBVV95cUxQM0s4cW9lMUdHRFY4dDRSRHNkb0N0TjlOZi1fa041VjlYLVowUmczZnlFMzJucjBVX1VZbEt3QWlhRnkxQVdwTm8yNWt2ZlhKQWZocUhPSVJXV25hblJCZlo1SnFTcnh0TGVJVlVYTktraU5obzFHLUx4VWRKVHVnZXpDSnVBY1Y2SEc5NzBNdXI0OXhGM3c</guid></item><item><title>每项研究显示，以这个速度“显着”提高50岁以上女性的减肥效果- AOL.com | Walking At This Pace 'Significantly' Boosted Weight Loss In Women Over 50, Per Study - AOL.com</title><link>https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiggFBVV95cUxNOGN5LTlGdjByNUh4cWdvTG5PZlNZZGVybGYtSTdxWDF3MHA0NXZveHpaZ1Y5UEl6VlVHSEE2V21ucFhuY29LZTV3Uy1nWEZPTS1xWlk1YjZkTnBlSHh4Y01LWXZUZVo2bVBwSEdncy1MMDIxUTkxOEtRX1JmWktwSFN3?oc=5</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper caption-aligned-with-image"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;&lt;span class="caption"&gt;How Slow Walks Can Boost Weight Loss&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="photo-credit"&gt;Morsa Images - Getty Images&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links."&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people assume that &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/g30985585/hiit-workout-at-home/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:high-intensity workouts;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;high-intensity workouts&lt;/a&gt; are the only way to burn fat and &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/how-to-lose-weight/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:lose weight;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;lose weight&lt;/a&gt;. But that’s just not the case when it comes to &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/walking/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:walking;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; for women older than 50, according to a recent study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, researchers discovered that women who moved at a slower pace burned more fat than those who sped through their strolls. Here’s the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meet the expert&lt;/strong&gt;: Albert Matheny, RD, CSCS, co-founder of &lt;a href="https://sohostrengthlab.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SoHo Strength Lab;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;SoHo Strength Lab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did the study find?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, which was published in the journal &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8840715/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Nutrients;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Nutrients&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in January 2022, followed 25 postmenopausal women who were asked to follow a walking routine for 15 weeks. At that point, nine finished the study and 16 continued a walking routine for another 15 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of the study participants walked about three miles for four days a week. Those in the fastest group walked about 4.1 miles an hour and exercised for about 45 minutes a day. Women in the slower group walked at a pace of 3.2 miles an hour and worked out for about 54 minutes a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of the 16 women who did the routine for 30 weeks, those who walked at a slower pace lost 2.73 times more fat than the speed walkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also worth noting? The fast walkers didn’t lose fat until they finished the 30 weeks of exercise, while the slower folks consistently lost fat during the study period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does slow walking boost weight loss?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not entirely clear. The researchers simply found that people in the slower walking group lost more weight—they didn’t determine why that was the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the scientists theorized that walking at faster speeds could leave you breathless, which makes your body more likely to use &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a42134304/continuous-glucose-monitor-blood-sugar/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:blood sugar;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;blood sugar&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a. glucose) for energy. At slower speeds, you may be more likely to burn fat instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, more research is needed to understand this link. Additional &lt;a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/a62920567/should-you-walk-faster-or-farther/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:research;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that walking further (but more slowly) boosts your endurance, while quick strolls condition your heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How slowly should I be walking?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study found that people had the best success with losing fat when they moved at 3.2 miles an hour. However, this was a small study and it’s not clear if the results will apply to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the researchers pointed out that fast walking may be better for some people. “Data from other studies indicate that longer impulses may promote greater fat loss at both slow and high exercise speeds,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can I incorporate more walking into my life?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To add more walking to your life, it’s best to try to create a routine, says Albert Matheny, RD, CSCS, co-founder of &lt;a href="https://sohostrengthlab.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:SoHo Strength Lab;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SoHo Strength Lab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That can mean trying to go for a walk before work or taking a lap or two during a break in your day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your steps add up over the course of your day, too, he points out. “Just do what you can, when you can,” Matheny says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;DMX Comfort+ Sneaker&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CP68MCRL?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.64466524%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$108.49 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$108.49 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Gel-Nimbus 26&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFNM471F?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.64466524%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$109.95 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$109.95 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cloudrunner 2&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link rapid-noclick-resp rapid-with-clickid etailiffa-link athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C5QJX7N9?tag=syn-yahoo-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5Bartid%7C2140.a.64466524%5Bsrc%7Cyahoo-us" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized" rel="sponsored" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:$159.95 at amazon.com;elm:affiliate_link;elmt:premonetized;itc:0;sec:content-canvas"&gt;$159.95 at amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 20:35:47 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiggFBVV95cUxNOGN5LTlGdjByNUh4cWdvTG5PZlNZZGVybGYtSTdxWDF3MHA0NXZveHpaZ1Y5UEl6VlVHSEE2V21ucFhuY29LZTV3Uy1nWEZPTS1xWlk1YjZkTnBlSHh4Y01LWXZUZVo2bVBwSEdncy1MMDIxUTkxOEtRX1JmWktwSFN3</guid></item></channel></rss>
