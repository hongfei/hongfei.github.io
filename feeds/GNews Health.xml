Brown eggs vs. white eggs—which is healthier? Some choose the brand or type of eggs they want regardless of the color, while others stick to the same hue every time they buy a new dozen. But does the difference on the outside extend to its contents?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet the experts: &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:2;pos:1" href="https://nutrition-wise.com/about-vicki-koenig/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Vicki Koenig, M.S., R.D., C.D.N.;cpos:2;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Vicki Koenig, M.S., R.D., C.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, a masters level registered dietitian at Nutrition-Wise; Emer Delaney, R.D., P.T., a registered dietitian and founder of &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:3;pos:1" href="http://www.myprivatediet.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:My Private Dietitian;cpos:3;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;My Private Dietitian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, dietitians explain the difference between brown eggs vs. white eggs, plus which you should be buying to get the most nutritional value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brown eggs vs. white eggs: What’s the difference?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The color of eggs has to do with the breed of the chicken,” says &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:4;pos:1" href="https://nutrition-wise.com/about-vicki-koenig/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Vicki Koenig, M.S., R.D., C.D.N.;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Vicki Koenig, M.S., R.D., C.D.N.&lt;/a&gt;, a masters level registered dietitian at Nutrition-Wise. “Whiter colored chickens lay white eggs.” Brown eggs, on the other hand, are laid by hens that have red or brown feathers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the color difference, you may have noticed that brown eggs tend to be more expensive than white. “The breeds that lay brown eggs are usually larger and consume more food and energy, which means they're more expensive for the farmer to produce,” says Emer Delaney, R.D., P.T., a registered dietitian and founder of &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:5;pos:1" href="http://www.myprivatediet.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:My Private Dietitian;cpos:5;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;My Private Dietitian&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:6;pos:1" href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/uploads/234/69325/Chicken_Breed_Chart_to_Help_Choose_Your_Chicken.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Hens that lay brown eggs;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;Hens that lay brown eggs&lt;/a&gt; are larger, most over seven pounds, while the chicken breeds that lay white eggs are smaller, typically weighing less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brown eggs vs. white eggs: Which is healthier?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Nutritionally, brown and white eggs are identical. There is no difference,” says Koenig.

These deliver benefits like energy and satiety, support for mood regulation and muscle control, and reduced inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:8;pos:1" href="https://www.incredibleegg.org/nutrition/articles/what-are-the-nutritional-differences-for-different-types-of-eggs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:American Egg Board;cpos:8;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;American Egg Board&lt;/a&gt;, brown and white eggs will still contain the same nutrient profiles, whether they are cage-free, free-range, conventional, or organic. They explain that these labels refer exclusively to the way the eggs are farmed and that the only way to change the nutrient content of the eggs themselves is to feed the hens a fortified diet (the increased levels of fortified nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids or &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:9;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/food-nutrition/a66133153/best-time-take-vitamin-d/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:vitamin D;cpos:9;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;vitamin D&lt;/a&gt;, would be noted in the nutrition facts).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published in &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:10;pos:1" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9102658/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:Molecules;cpos:10;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Molecules&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;compared the nutritional components of organic and conventional eggs, finding that organic eggs actually had higher levels of nutrients needed for infant and child growth and development, and conventional eggs had more that were beneficial for fat metabolism and &lt;a data-i13n="cpos:11;pos:1" href="https://www.prevention.com/health/a65628846/foods-to-lower-cholesterol-naturally/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:reducing cholesterol;cpos:11;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;reducing cholesterol&lt;/a&gt;, despite both containing cholesterol. Though ultimately, both had plenty of nutrients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The color of the eggshell reflects the color of the hen that laid the egg. “It’s as fun and as simple as that,” says Delaney. While brown eggs are often more expensive than white eggs, that doesn’t mean they are better for you—both colors will deliver all the impressive health benefits eggs have to offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Might Also Like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>AOL.com</author><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 14:41:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMid0FVX3lxTE5JdjNSUU9FbmlZT3Z2MVhkMTVZdG9kdkRxWnd4UFpGMmZSel9mcjRNQXpoa3QyMmhUNU42dDlsX0poWUpEcVJ4WjZpNGdzN3BGdWsxajlMQUtYWlJTbGxkWld3VnVhQUg4aEVLZ0h2YVoyVkFleFU4</guid></item><item><title>全球预期寿命已恢复到疫情前的水平，但青少年和年轻人的死亡人数正在上升- CNN</title><link>https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/12/health/global-mortality-risk-factors-adolescents-young-adults</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="article__content" data-editable="content" itemprop="articleBody" data-reorderable="content"&gt;

            Humans are living 20 years longer than they were in 1950, according to new research with all 204 countries and territories studied reporting declines in their mortality rates since then. But vast inequities remain, and there is an “emerging crisis” of rising death rates among adolescents and young adults.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n00043b6nygi8gdbo@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            In 2023, life expectancy was 76.3 years for women and 71.5 years for men, according to &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01330-3/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;analyses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;published Sunday in the journal The Lancet by the University of Washington School of Medicine’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) – returning to pre-pandemic levels after falling during the height of Covid.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Covid-19 fell from the leading cause of death in 2021 to 20th place in 2023, with heart disease and stroke rising to again become the leading causes of death globally.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Deaths worldwide have generally been shifting away from infectious disease, with sharp declines in deaths from measles, diarrheal diseases and tuberculosis, &lt;a href="https://nam11.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thelancet.com%2Fjournals%2Flancet%2Farticle%2FPIIS0140-6736(25)01917-8%2Ffulltext&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CDeidre.McPhillips%40cnn.com%7Ce46539032fd94f627b5908de081ff30c%7C0eb48825e8714459bc72d0ecd68f1f39%7C0%7C0%7C638957130480695273%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=O3XV4oJjSMU2XHU4VyGS7XofJf6XMtXSiGOqaDVWMFw%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank"&gt;according to IHME&lt;/a&gt;.

            Noncommunicable diseases now account for about two-thirds of global mortality and morbidity, including both deaths and broader burden from disease. Although mortality rates for heart disease and stroke have declined since 1990, rates have increased for diabetes, chronic kidney disease and Alzheimer’s disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            “The rapid growth in the world’s aging population and evolving risk factors have ushered in a new era of global health challenges,” IHME Director Dr. Christopher Murray said. “The evidence presented in the Global Burden of Disease study is a wake-up call, urging government and health care leaders to respond swiftly and strategically to the disturbing trends that are reshaping public health needs.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

            About half of the world’s disease burden is preventable, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(25)01637-X/fulltext" target="_blank"&gt;new research&lt;/a&gt;, attributable to dozens of modifiable risk factors.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            High blood pressure, smoking, high cholesterol, diabetes and obesity are among the 10 risk factors with the greatest effect, IHME found. Between 2010 and 2023, there was an 11% greater burden of disease due to high body mass index – measured by years of life lost due to disability or premature death – and a 6% increase due to high blood sugar.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n000b3b6nn64luxc9@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Environmental factors such as particulate matter pollution and lead exposure were also among the most significant risk factors, along with those related to newborn health including low birthweight and short gestation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n000c3b6ni77hsxvr@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Additionally, mental health plays a significant role in global mortality, according to the new research, with burden from anxiety and depression surging.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n000d3b6ncwalv4fx@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            While the global population is growing and aging, death rates among children and young adults have increased in some parts of the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n000e3b6nk0tpiggk@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Among adolescents and young adults, the largest increase in deaths over the past decade or so was among those ages 20 to 39 in high-income North America, mainly due to suicide, drug overdose and high quantities of alcohol, according to the IHME research.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n000f3b6nwqi3t8lw@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Deaths among those ages 5 to 19 also increased in Eastern Europe, high-income North America and the Caribbean, and among adolescents and young adults in sub-Saharan Africa, due to infectious diseases and unintentional injuries.
    &lt;/p&gt;

            Globally, for children 5 to 14, iron deficiency was the leading risk, followed by others related to unsafe water, sanitation, and hygiene and malnutrition. For the 15 to 49 age group, the top two risks were unsafe sex and occupational injuries, followed by high BMI, high systolic blood pressure and smoking.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n000h3b6nipvawn28@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            Overall, life expectancy ranged from as high as 83 years in high-income regions to as low as 62 years in sub-Saharan Africa, IHME found.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n000i3b6nzvx9i1v8@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            This new research highlights an “urgent need for policymakers to expand health priorities,” IHME researchers said – especially among adolescents and young adults – rather than limiting resources.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class="paragraph-elevate inline-placeholder vossi-paragraph" data-uri="cms.cnn.com/_components/paragraph/instances/cmglcca6n000j3b6np9apo3hh@published" data-editable="text" data-component-name="paragraph" data-article-gutter="true"&gt;
            “Decades of work to close the gap in low-income regions with persistent health inequities are in danger of unraveling due to the recent cuts to international aid,” said Emmanuela Gakidou, senior author of the new studies&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and professor at IHME. “These countries rely on global health funding for life-saving primary care, medicine, and vaccines. Without it, the gap is sure to widen.”
    &lt;/p&gt;

Drawing from more than 14 million website visits, researchers found that AI-related browsing made up less than one percent of online activity for most people. The study also indicates that individuals who use AI more often tend to exhibit certain aversive personality traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is growing public and academic interest in artificial intelligence, particularly its expanding role in education, work, and entertainment. While many surveys have asked people whether they use AI and how they feel about it, these self-reports are often unreliable. People tend to misjudge or misremember how often they use technology, especially newer forms like AI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To move beyond self-reported data, the researchers set out to directly measure AI use through people’s actual web browsing histories. Their goal was to determine how often AI tools are used in everyday life, identify who uses them the most, and examine what types of online activities are typically associated with AI use. Understanding the psychological traits linked to higher levels of AI interaction could help researchers and policymakers anticipate how different groups may adopt or resist AI technologies in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s been enormous public discussion about AI and its societal impact, but surprisingly little objective data on how people actually use it in their everyday browsing,” said study author &lt;a href="https://emilykmckinley.scholar.st/" target="_blank"&gt;Emily McKinley&lt;/a&gt;, a PhD candidate at the University of California, Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Despite widespread concerns and excitement about tools like ChatGPT, we had almost no baseline understanding of actual usage patterns. We wanted to measure what’s really happening, examining not just usage frequency, but also the psychological profiles of AI adopters and how AI integrates into their broader digital behaviors.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project included two separate studies. The first involved 499 university students from two institutions, while the second focused on 455 members of the general public. In both cases, participants shared their web browsing history over a period of up to 90 days. Only those who used Google Chrome were included, as this browser allowed for the necessary data export. Participants also completed surveys measuring their personality traits, attitudes toward AI, and demographics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a list of well-known AI websites, such as ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, the researchers identified which browser visits were AI-related. Other websites were categorized using a content classification system powered by a large language model. The researchers then analyzed the data to understand the proportion of AI visits relative to total browsing, what kinds of websites were visited immediately before and after using AI, and which psychological traits correlated with AI use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the student sample, AI use made up just 1 percent of all website visits on average. Most participants rarely used AI at all, and only a small number accounted for the majority of the traffic. The most commonly visited AI site by far was ChatGPT, representing over 85 percent of all AI-related visits. While this use rate was higher than visits to web versions of some social media platforms like Instagram, it was far below the rate of search engine use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We were genuinely surprised by how infrequent AI use was, even among students who typically serve as early adopters of emerging technologies,” McKinley told PsyPost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students who used AI more often were slightly more likely to score high on personality traits associated with narcissism and psychopathy. These individuals also tended to have more positive attitudes toward AI in general. There were some weak associations between AI use and demographics, such as income and gender, but age and ethnicity were not significantly related to AI use in this group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the general public sample showed even lower rates of AI use, with an average of just 0.44 percent of website visits being AI-related. Once again, ChatGPT was the most visited AI platform. Fewer significant correlations between personality and AI use were observed in this group, but there was a modest relationship between Machiavellianism and AI browsing. Those who expressed more favorable views of AI were also somewhat more likely to use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers paid particular attention to individuals they called “prolific users,” defined as those whose AI browsing accounted for more than 4 percent of their total website visits. Among the student group, these prolific users scored much higher on measures of Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy compared to their peers. These patterns were less clear in the general public sample, possibly because AI use was less frequent overall, reducing the ability to detect meaningful differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Interestingly, people who use AI more tend to score higher on aversive personality traits, particularly Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy, though these patterns were stronger among students,” McKinley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both groups, the researchers also analyzed what participants were doing online in the seconds before and after visiting an AI website. Before using AI, many were on internet and telecom sites, such as search engines and login pages. After AI use, participants were more likely to visit websites related to education, computers, or professional tasks. These patterns suggest that AI tools are often used as part of a workflow, especially in academic or job-related contexts. The researchers argue that this may point to AI being seen more as a productivity tool than a source of entertainment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key finding involved the gap between self-reported and actual AI use. In the general public sample, participants were asked how often they believed they used AI. The correlation between their estimates and their actual browsing data was moderate, suggesting that self-reports alone are not a reliable way to assess AI use. This result aligns with previous research on other forms of media, where people often underreport or overreport their habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this study provides rare objective data on AI use, there are still some limitations. First, the analysis was limited to web-based interactions. Mobile app use, which may be more common for some users, was not included. Similarly, only Google Chrome users could participate, which may have influenced the sample.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research also focused primarily on a narrow set of individual traits, such as personality and basic demographics. Other factors, such as emotional well-being, motivations, or social environments, could play an important role in AI adoption but were not examined here. The team suggests that future studies should explore how these additional psychological and social variables relate to AI use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also note the importance of understanding what people are doing during their time on AI platforms. While this study captured how often users visited AI websites, it could not track whether they were writing essays, solving problems, or simply exploring out of curiosity. Capturing the content of interactions could shed light on the goals and intentions behind AI use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, as AI becomes more integrated into daily life, usage patterns may change. The researchers plan to continue this line of inquiry by examining whether AI use is linked to specific outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We want to understand not just how often people use AI, but what they’re using it for and how that content relates to their individual characteristics,” McKinley explained. “We’re also interested in examining the downstream consequences of AI use: for example, does actual usage predict outcomes like academic integrity, information-seeking behaviors, or work performance?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This research represents one of the first attempts to objectively quantify AI use in naturalistic settings using months of actual browsing data. While AI currently dominates many of our cultural conversations, the data suggest most people are still using it quite sparingly. The methodological approach we developed, combining passive digital trace data with psychological measures, offers a valuable template for future technology research, helping us move beyond the limitations of self-report and understand how individual differences shape technology adoption in the real world.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, “&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/21522715251379987" target="_blank"&gt;Evaluating Artificial Intelligence Use and Its Psychological Correlates via Months of Web-Browsing Data&lt;/a&gt;,” was authored by Emily McKinley, David M.

&lt;div class="mntl-sc-block-universal-callout__body"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin C is necessary for a healthy immune system, joints and disease prevention.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The average adult needs 75 mg to 90 mg per day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vitamin C is found in citrus fruits, bell peppers and cruciferous veggies.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_2-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; It may take a sniffly nose, sneezing or a pesky cough to bring vitamin C to mind. Getting sick reminds us of our immune function, which may leave you wondering whether you should take vitamin C daily. Vitamin C is a well-known vitamin in citrus fruits that many people turn to when under the weather. That's because it can enhance immune health and may reduce the length of a cold.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="1"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_3-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_4-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; But immune function isn't the only thing vitamin C is necessary for. It's also a crucial nutrient and antioxidant that aids in producing compounds that support different body functions. So, can you benefit from taking a regular vitamin C supplement? Read on to learn more about what happens when you take vitamin C every day.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_5-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class="heading-toc" id="toc-why-we-love-vitamin-c"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 id="mntl-sc-block_6-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-heading__text text-title-300"&gt; Why We Love Vitamin C &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_7-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Support Immune Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_8-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While it's common to find bare shelves of vitamin C during flu season, how it impacts immunity is unclear. That said, we do know the skin needs normal levels of vitamin C to maintain a healthy barrier to keep harmful pathogens from entering the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="2"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_9-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_10-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin C is also present in immune cells, so having sufficient levels is vital. Low levels of vitamin C could make you more susceptible to sickness. As an antioxidant, vitamin C protects cells from oxidative damage and regulates anti-inflammatory pathways, helping reduce inflammation and, therefore, the risk of chronic health conditions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_11-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_12-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Prevent Lead Poisoning &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_13-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Consuming vitamin C may help alleviate lead exposure. Lead is a heavy metal found in some paint, jewelry, soil and other products that is poisonous in high concentrations. Even the most minor blood levels of lead can impact how well a child performs in school. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, routinely eating foods rich in iron, calcium and vitamin C may help keep lead out of the body.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, more research is needed to understand the beneficial effects. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_14-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_15-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; Might Improve Iron Levels &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; According to one small study, iron deficiency is the most prevalent micronutrient deficiency.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Populations most at risk are infants, young children, pregnant people and females of reproductive age.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_17-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_18-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The CDC recommends improving iron absorption by pairing an iron-rich food with a vitamin C-rich food, such as mandarin oranges with salad greens.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; And some studies have seen significant differences in iron levels when supplementing with vitamin C and iron compared to iron alone.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is especially true of non-heme iron, the type of iron found in plants.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_19-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_20-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Improve Joint Health &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_21-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Vitamin C is necessary to form collagen, a vital part of connective tissue, which helps mend wounds. While research is mixed on this topic, many studies support vitamin C supplementation for reducing pain and inflammation related to osteoarthritis.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="8"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This is partly due to vitamin C's role in collagen formation, as well as its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_22-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mntl-sc-block_23-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block eatingwell-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"&gt; &lt;span class="mntl-sc-block-subheading__text"&gt; May Act as an Anti-Tumor Agent &lt;/span&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_24-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Thanks to vitamin C's powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, there is evidence that it may act as an anti-tumor agent.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="9"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Researchers note that vitamin C is not a replacement for traditional cancer treatment, but an adjunct to it. When used in this way, it may improve treatment results.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_27-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; There is evidence that vitamin C protects neurons (brain cells) against oxidative stress and may be helpful to mental health.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; For example, one study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) found that older adults with higher vitamin C intake had lower rates of cognitive decline.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="11"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Researchers note that these benefits plateaued at about 500 mg/day of vitamin C, suggesting that more than this offers no further brain benefits.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_34-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Most people have sufficient vitamin C intake because many consume foods naturally rich in vitamin C or fortified with it. Yet, others may need more. According to the National Cancer Institute, 7% of people in the U.S. have scurvy, a condition where vitamin C levels fall below normal.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Scurvy happens from eating too few vitamin C sources or impaired absorption in the digestive tract. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_35-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_36-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Symptoms of vitamin C deficiency include:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_37-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul id="mntl-sc-block_38-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; &lt;li&gt;Loss of teeth&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Swollen, bleeding gums&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Muscle weakness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Poor wound healing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anemia&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Weight loss&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hyperkeratosis (thickening of the skin's outer layer)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Arthralgia (stiff joints)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_41-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; How much vitamin C you need depends on your age, sex and whether you're pregnant or breastfeeding. The average adult male needs 90 mg per day, while the average adult female needs 75 mg per day. If you're pregnant, you need 85 mg per day, and if you're breastfeeding, shoot for 120 mg per day.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_44-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; While oranges tend to be the go-to for vitamin C, this nutrient hangs out in lots of nourishing sources, with many of them &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/article/2052728/6-foods-with-more-vitamin-c-than-an-orange/" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;having more vitamin C&lt;/a&gt; than an orange.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_51-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; The recommended daily amount of vitamin C for adults is 90 mg.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="13"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Overloading yourself with vitamin C is unlikely, since our body rids what it can't use in urine, but it is still possible to overdo it. For example, digestive upset, including stomach cramps, diarrhea and nausea, commonly occurs when unabsorbed vitamin C is in the intestines.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_52-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_53-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; High vitamin C levels can cause increases in oxalates, which make you more prone to kidney stones, especially for people with poor kidney function. For example, one review reports that vitamin C doses greater than 1 gram may increase the chances of stone formation by 41%.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; The same review reported that women taking too much vitamin C during pregnancy could result in rebound scurvy in newborn babies. Excess vitamin C may also affect vitamin B12 and copper levels and cause dental enamel erosion. Because of these health risks, an upper limit for adults ages 19 and up is 2,000 mg daily.&lt;span class="ql-inline-citation" data-cite="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt; However, some people may be taking more under the supervision of a medical provider.

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_56-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; You can find &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/best-vitamin-c-supplements-8686368" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;vitamin C supplements&lt;/a&gt; in various forms, such as powders, gummies, chewable tablets, non-chewable tablets and capsules. When looking for one, consider what form of vitamin C will help you be consistent. If mixing powdered vitamin C with water isn't for you, you might choose chewable. If you dislike swallowing pills, you may enjoy gummies, but if you are sensitive to added sugar, you might opt for a capsule. Choose the form that works best for your lifestyle.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_57-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-adslot mntl-block"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_58-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Take a close look at supplement ingredient lists to pinpoint any additives it may have, such as artificial colors, added sugars, preservatives or fillers. And while the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-supplement-8645052" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;doesn't regulate supplements&lt;/a&gt;, you can still take steps to ensure your supplement is reliable, safe and effective. Independent labeling can help identify a trustworthy supplement. USP, NSF and ConsumerLabs are examples of independent labels to seek on the packaging or bottle to help ensure you're getting honest ingredients.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p id="mntl-sc-block_61-0" class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"&gt; Supplements can be costly, and a routine daily dose of a vitamin C supplement isn't necessary for healthy people, since most people have healthy vitamin C levels. Talk to your healthcare provider first if you're considering taking a vitamin C supplement. Otherwise, if you're concerned about getting enough vitamin C foods, simply turn to your local market and stock up on vitamin C-rich fruits and vegetables. Whether fresh, frozen or canned, produce like pineapple, potatoes and bell peppers are plentiful in vitamin C, and enjoying more of them can meet your everyday needs.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div id="mntl-accordion__content_1-0" class="comp mntl-accordion__content"&gt; &lt;div class="faq-accordion__item-answer"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin C can be safe to take daily; however, it's helpful to know that you can meet your daily needs by eating vitamin C-rich foods. For instance, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/health-benefits-of-kiwi-8650515" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;a half-cup of kiwi&lt;/a&gt; offers 134 mg of vitamin C, which provides 148% to 178% of the recommended daily needs. Before taking any new supplements, it's best practice to speak with your medical provider and stay below the upper limit for vitamin C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing beats getting vitamin C from whole foods, which is the ultimate form. Many foods are brimming with vitamin C, like citrus fruits, cruciferous veggies and potatoes. If you're still interested in a vitamin C supplement, the best form to take is synthetic ascorbic acid and the presentation you can easily ingest, which for some could be a mixable powder and, for others, an easy-to-swallow capsule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vitamin C supplements can benefit people, especially those with low vitamin C levels. But vitamin C-rich foods, packed with many other essential vitamins and minerals, are better for you. If you choose to take a supplement, &lt;a href="https://www.eatingwell.com/what-to-look-for-in-a-supplement-8645052" data-component="link" data-source="inlineLink" data-type="internalLink" data-ordinal="1"&gt;make sure it's been independently verified&lt;/a&gt; by a reputable company, so you know what you're getting in that bottle is safe and its ingredients are what the label says.&lt;/p&gt;

No, there is no magical pill, but the answer lies in your very own body. Yes, that is right! Movement is one of the most powerful tools for anti-ageing, and reducing the risk of major chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and cognitive decline. Dr. Sanjay Bhojraj, a US cardiologist with 20 years of experience, emphasises that how we move daily is more important than complex health fads or medicine cabinets. Let’s dig deeper…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="4"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Why movement is the most powerful anti-ageing tool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bhojraj highlights that over 80% of chronic diseases are driven by lifestyle factors - how we move, eat, sleep, and manage stress. Among these, intentional movement is the “most powerful anti-ageing tool” we have. It does not mean intense workouts only; any movement that challenges your muscles and lungs teaches your cells to stay strong and alive. This sets the foundation for healthier ageing. He says, “How you move, eat, sleep, and manage stress determines far more about your longevity than what’s in your medicine cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Why are women more at risk for heart disease?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet… most people start at the pharmacy instead of with their physiology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="17"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How movement cuts disease risk by 50%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="19"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Bhojraj, regular strength and aerobic exercises can lower your risk of heart disease, diabetes, and cognitive decline by up to half. This is huge because no medicine can come close to providing these benefits. The movement signals to the mitochondria in your cells - your energy engines to thrive on oxygen and sunlight, powering your longevity naturally. According to Dr Bhojraj, “Studies show consistent strength and aerobic training can lower your risk of heart disease, diabetes, and cognitive decline by up to 50%. No pill comes close to that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Walking: A simple yet powerful step&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t need fancy equipment or a gym membership. Dr. Bhojraj points out that consistent daily walking can bring remarkable heart benefits. Walking 10,000 steps or even 20 to 30 minutes daily helps regulate blood pressure, improves circulation, and supports healthy heart rhythms. A study shows that walking daily can reduce heart disease risk by nearly 50%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="28"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Movement is key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="30"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Movement is not just physical; it also lowers cortisol, the body’s main stress hormone. High cortisol harms the heart and brain. Regular movement eases stress, improving mood and cognitive function. Slower walking pace or lack of movement correlates with higher risks of depression, anxiety, and memory issues, while regular movement protects brain health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="32"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Movement is for everyone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="36"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bhojraj encourages integrating movement into daily life in any form—walking, yoga, swimming, or strength training. The message is clear: “To age well, start here, not at the pharmacy.” He further added, “That’s not a hack—it’s how your body was designed to heal.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 08:30:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiswJBVV95cUxPc1Z6ZVh6eU5UOFlZS0JGU0dfWmswcklxNnNTZUFibGM1TDRKV3E5Q1BjZzEwRE5UTHVYaEt1QzBicXNoOWlEZFo4aEx3SVh1d1NJRFlZSVJwYU9MMXhRWms5MUp6YzJMOWRDYTB4YmtTYjlEaE9RTDdWWnBKbWNwTEphMno2ZDc2QWR6SG1VelZQT2NsRjRQWWd4NVRQaktYUzRKZzd1RE40bFRmUW5RbFVGNzNPTXV5LWh1d0Y4RXdzWFVQZUdUTFp5Tnh6M1lSOUl3c25pTDM5NHNCS2FndG5YRkNZTjNuUE5PRzdieGtVRDcyRkhkOEY2NHFEeF9Ib0JJcG9Kc1RKbUNSR1ZHVnRfdnBmMWh1ZGloZWN6OVd6c2NkbFZ5eE9QVkdDTlpHOEdj</guid></item><item><title>杂货店里6个最差的热狗品牌- AOL.com</title><link>https://www.aol.com/finance/6-worst-hot-dog-brands-211701585.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="caas-body"&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;div class="no-margin"&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="caption-wrapper"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption-collapse"&gt;Justin Sullivan/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hot dogs get a bad rap. But a good one, a real one, can hold its own next to a burger or even a steak. The problem is, most of what ends up in grocery carts isn’t that. With summer cookouts around the corner, we looked at some of the most popular grocery brands and checked &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/18x9h8g/what_is_a_hotdog_brand_you_dont_like/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:which ones get the most hate from shoppers on Reddit.com;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;which ones get the most hate from shoppers on Reddit.com&lt;/a&gt; — and why. Here are the six worst grocery store hot dogs, according to shoppers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gwaltney Great Dogs Original&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gwaltney claims these are &lt;a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Gwaltney-Original-Chicken-Hot-Dogs-Bun-Size-3-lb/10452733" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:“America’s No. 1 chicken hot dog,”;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;“America’s No. 1 chicken hot dog,”&lt;/a&gt; and their main selling point is that they have 40% less fat than regular beef hot dogs. They’re marketed as a lighter, affordable option, and you’ll usually find them at places like Walmart, Food Lion, and other big grocery chains for about $1.50 to $2 a pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you’re actually getting is a hot dog made mostly of mechanically separated chicken, with some pork, water, corn syrup, and generic “flavorings.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re not big in the flavor department either — and judging by Reddit, people have some strong feelings about that. “They are absolutely horrific and the way they look in the frying pan is disturbing me to my core,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/1fujwa2/comment/lpzzhrr/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:said one Redditor.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;said one Redditor.&lt;/a&gt;“They’re the second worst hot dog I’ve ever had the displeasure of biting into and then promptly spitting into a napkin and throwing away,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/1fujwa2/comment/lpzx4t8/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:adds another.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;adds another.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;FUD Hot Dogs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll mostly find them at Walmart and select grocery stores, especially in areas with a large Hispanic customer base. They’re priced in the low-to-mid range, usually around $2.50 to $3 a pack, but you’re mostly paying for disappointment. These are made from mechanically separated chicken and pork, with salt, flavoring, and sodium lactate to round out the flavorless parade. Reddit users have roasted FUD consistently for years — many say they couldn’t even finish the pack. The texture is rubbery, the taste is bland and off-putting, and even boiling doesn’t help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Bar-S Classic and Beef Franks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bar-S is an ultra-budget brand owned by Sigma (yes, same as FUD), and it’s one of the top-selling hot dog brands in America, not because it’s good, but because it’s dirt cheap. You can find it everywhere from Walmart to Dollar General, usually under $1.50 per pack. It’s also one of the most hated hot dog brands out there. The classic franks are made with mechanically separated chicken and turkey, with a little pork thrown in and beef hearts for flair. Ingredients include corn syrup, sodium nitrite, and potassium lactate. On Reddit and Chowhound, they’re called “possessed,” “mushy,” “too sweet,” and “unsettling in texture.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Bar s dogs of all flavors are like eating marshmallow meat and they don’t get plump when you cook them”&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/18x9h8g/comment/kg2waog/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one Redditor said.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one Redditor said.&lt;/a&gt; “Mystery meat dogs at their worst.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Oscar Mayer Classic Wieners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oscar Mayer proudly claims their hot dogs have “no fillers,” which feels a bit rich when you flip the package over and see what’s actually in them. The ingredient list starts with mechanically separated chicken and turkey, plus some pork, which translates to mystery meat and a long scroll of additives like sodium phosphate, sodium benzoate, and sodium nitrite. This isn’t exactly a clean label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find these just about everywhere — Target, Kroger, Safeway — for around $3.50 to $5 a pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They do have a nostalgic fan base, but they are also wildly roasted on Reddit for being the “default bad hot dog.” ​​I sometimes think about buying Oscar Mayers hot dogs then I see them on the shelf and I look at their color and then always pass,” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/18x9h8g/comment/kg9k6hj/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one user sums it up.;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one user sums it up.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Ball Park Franks (Regular and Grillmaster)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ball Park is everywhere — Costco, CVS, your neighbor’s Fourth of July cookout. Owned by Tyson Foods, the brand has been around forever and sells a dizzying number of varieties. The regular franks are made from a blend of mechanically separated chicken and pork, corn syrup, and a long list of preservatives. They’re soft, overly sweet, and don’t grill particularly well. According to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hotdogs/comments/18x9h8g/comment/kgglubl/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank" data-ylk="slk:one Redditor;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas" class="link rapid-noclick-resp"&gt;one Redditor&lt;/a&gt;. “They taste like what you imagine hot dog water tastes like.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beef versions, especially the Grillmaster line, get noticeably more respect. They’re made with actual beef — no mystery meats — and they cook up with better texture and flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Jennie-O Turkey Franks&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;figure class="caas-figure align-caption-with-image"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jennie-O is known for turkey, but these franks don’t do the brand any favors. They show up in most grocery stores — Safeway, Meijer, Albertsons — for around $3 to $4 a pack, and they’re sold as the “healthier” option. But low fat doesn’t mean much when the end result is dry, dense, and painfully bland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ingredients aren’t great either — mechanically separated turkey, water, corn syrup, and not much else.

This is the type of stress you experience consistently, for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Kaeberlein, it’s not uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Most people have chronic stress, and it’s really the chronic stress that is detrimental to your health,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-how-to-figure-out-if-you-have-chronic-stress" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-figure-out-if-you-have-chronic-stress"&gt;&lt;span&gt;How to figure out if you have chronic stress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="ea64ce5f-4bb9-4fb6-8ea0-c28207e9e25d"&gt;Knowing whether or not you have chronic stress is simply a matter of identifying whether or not you’re regularly stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You don’t need complicated devices. I think most people, if they are in touch with themselves, can tell if they are stressed or not,” Kaeberlein says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re struggling to identify your emotions, some devices can help you keep tabs on your stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We have a growing number of tools [and metrics] that we can use to estimate whether somebody is experiencing an unhealthy level of chronic stress. Heart rate variability is a good example,” Kaeberlein says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check id="190a0464-bfcf-4614-9741-3626074089be"&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images/ andreswd)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p id="7f91da29-251c-4d9f-b6d6-24c92ea477a0"&gt;Fitness trackers from &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fitandwell.com/tag/apple" data-auto-tag-linker="true" data-before-rewrite-localise="https://www.fitandwell.com/tag/apple"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, Oura and Garmin offer heart rate variability tests. These aren’t 100% accurate, but they can show you trends in your heart rate variability and give you a general indication of stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're looking for a more sophisticated test, Kaeberlein recommends a device called &lt;a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://trainwithmorpheus.com/" target="_blank" data-url="https://trainwithmorpheus.com/" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;Morpheus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If you can measure it well, [heart rate variability] is actually a really powerful biomarker for understanding whether somebody is experiencing chronic stress at a level that is unhealthy for them,” says Kaeberlein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-two-ways-that-dr-matt-kaeberlein-reduced-his-stress-levels" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-two-ways-that-dr-matt-kaeberlein-reduced-his-stress-levels"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Two ways that Dr Matt Kaeberlein reduced his stress levels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="f15d2c6d-b820-4b6f-b259-d5498c1f1783"&gt;If you are experiencing stress, it's a good idea to speak to a healthcare professional. But there are also things you can do in your daily life to reduce stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Anything that we can do to learn how to manage that stress will have a positive impact on our health going forward,” says Kaeberlein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaeberlein says there are two key things he's done to reduce his stress levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="van-image-figure inline-layout " data-bordeaux-image-check id="90e4c41d-888e-4ea8-b375-b950ce3d9019"&gt;&lt;p class="credit"&gt;(Image credit: Getty Images/ FG Trade Latin)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;a id="elk-exercise" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-exercise"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Exercise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="4a956172-4724-4c8c-a98d-cf374bdb56b5"&gt;Regular exercise has lots of benefits, but many people don't realise it's also a great stress-buster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Lifting weights is a great stress management tool,” says Kaeberlein, revealing that this is the main form of exercise he does. “I exercise regularly. That's something that I obviously believe is very important for health.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a id="elk-limit-social-media" href="" data-url="" target="_blank" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade" data-hl-processed="none"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-limit-social-media"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Limit social media &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p id="9f93f325-1138-4c7e-9792-4d8cd30f3772"&gt;“In our daily lives, in the world that we live in today, we are overwhelmed with information and stimuli,” says Kaeberlein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There's a variety of aspects to how social media can cause stress. One is how much negative information is on social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The constant underlying negative feelings or negative information that you’re experiencing drives chronic release of hormones like cortisol.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, Kaeberlein says that he tries to limit the amount he uses social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I tend to stay off of social media, and I tend not to consume a lot of news right now,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

Drinking methi water every day for a month can be extremely powerful due to the rich nutrients and bioactive compounds, present in fenugreek seeds. Here are 5 important changes that can occur in the body with regular methi water consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="3"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Better digestion and gut health&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="6"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The soluble fiber in methi water absorbs water to create a stomach gel that slows down digestion, and treats bloating and acidity and constipation. The prebiotic properties of methi water support beneficial gut bacteria, which leads to better nutrient absorption and improved overall gut health. The digestive system of many people improves after using methi water for several weeks which leads to reduced stomach problems and regular bowel movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="10"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;How to reduce your sugar intake without feeling deprived: 9 foods for managing diabetes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Stable blood sugar levels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8344183/" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; has shown that methi water effectively controls blood sugar levels in the body. The galactomannans and 4-hydroxyisoleucine compounds in fenugreek seeds, work together to decrease sugar absorption rates while enhancing insulin receptor sensitivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People with diabetes along with those who have diabetes risk factors can benefit from this remedy because it helps control blood sugar levels and reduces peak blood sugar values. Doctor-supervised patients who use methi water regularly, might need to take their medication at lower doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Weight management&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fiber content in methi water creates a feeling of fullness which helps people eat less and control their food cravings. The combination of natural appetite suppression and metabolic enhancement through methi water consumption, leads to weight management by stopping excessive eating and enhancing fat breakdown. The combination of healthy eating and exercise with regular methi water consumption, leads to steady weight reduction during a thirty-day period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="29"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Healthier skin and hair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="34"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents in methi water work to enhance skin &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-of-fenugreek" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; by fighting acne while creating a radiant and clear complexion. The liquid from methi water provides essential nutrients to hair follicles, which helps control dandruff and strengthens hair to stop hair loss. Users who drink methi water regularly experience decreased skin problems and improved hair quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="40"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Heart health and lower cholesterol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="43"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drinking methi water daily has been proven to decrease levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, which benefits heart health. The beneficial effects of methi water consumption work to clear arteries while decreasing the chances of developing cardiovascular diseases. Regular consumption of methi water as part of a balanced lifestyle helps create better cholesterol numbers which protects against heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="47"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Precautions and side effects&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methi water provides various health advantages yet some users experience adverse reactions including stomach problems and allergic responses and diarrhea. Women who are pregnant should stay away from drinking methi water, since it increases the chances of miscarriage. People with low potassium levels or specific medical conditions need to consult their doctor before using methi water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="53"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="strong" data-ua-type="1"&gt;How to prepare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="55"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;People need to soak 1-2 teaspoons of fenugreek seeds in water throughout an entire night before straining the liquid in the morning for an empty stomach consumption. The practice of chewing soaked seeds after soaking provides extra fiber and nutrients, which boosts the health advantages of methi water consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="57"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="em" data-ua-type="1"&gt;Disclaimer: This article is informational only and not a substitute for medical advice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="59"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="62"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="64"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 05:36:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMipgJBVV95cUxObFpGXzFTWldKS2RiMVY3QWhXc09QT2VHZ2VwV0ZGMXJXY2N4Vkt0WFo3bG5JdzQ3cmJGYklIU3lZRmE2dkpqaDFLcWc2dXlYU1BfV095M0ZBNDFxRlFPUEhqQjFvVWM0WGtPSW9YU09FanZFVFFXNmxDYm1ZQVFJYnhwdWV3MTlubWZ1b094SDFKcjl1aHNoSXA2ejBKUDNuODV4YWhiUmJrQ3Uxd0tXbXF1c19wdzhJWFZSbjRDdzZtQk04am1EcDljSnlMUTNjRWVZRld1TXU0SVc2dU94UkJNdUtjbDZLX1dZcUlLS3hzczVobkJIRzZjRG1BNHdYQ2hkdFNMWjdxX1VrYkVyMUJTQ1ZMVnRiWHQ5YkdydXc2YUJyelE</guid></item><item><title>哈佛大学训练有素的胃肠病学家AIIMS分享了不健康肠道的5个早期迹象：对饭后腹胀的免疫力低下|健康-印度斯坦时报</title><link>https://www.hindustantimes.com/lifestyle/health/aiims-and-harvard-trained-gastroenterologist-shares-5-early-signs-of-unhealthy-gut-weak-immunity-bloating-after-meal-101760237662285.html</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="detail " dataid="/lifestyle/health/aiims-and-harvard-trained-gastroenterologist-shares-5-early-signs-of-unhealthy-gut-weak-immunity-bloating-after-meal-101760237662285.html"&gt; &lt;div class="storyParagraphFigure"&gt; &lt;p&gt;A compromised &lt;a class="backlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/topic/gut-microbiota" data-vars-page-type="story" data-vars-link-type="Manual" data-vars-anchor-text="gut"&gt;gut &lt;/a&gt;often becomes the cause of many underlying issues in our body.

Which of these signs have you noticed in yourself?” Let's find out:&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;1. Funhealthy gut&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the gastroenterologist trained at AIIMS, if you're always feeling gassy or bloated after meals, it could mean your gut bacteria are imbalanced.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Irregular bowel movements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stating irregular bowel movements as a sign of an unhealthy gut, the gastroenterologist said, “Chronic constipation or diarrhoea is often your gut's way of signalling trouble.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Unexplained fatigue&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Poor gut health affects nutrient absorption, leaving you tired even after proper rest,” Dr Saurabh Sethi pointed out.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Food intolerances&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If certain foods trigger discomfort, according to the gastroenterologist, your gut microbiome may be struggling to process them properly, which can be an early sign of compromised gut health.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. Weakened immunity&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, a weakened immunity is also an early sign of an unhealthy gut. Dr Sethi noted, “70 percent of your immune system lives in your gut.

This number is projected to increase by 73% by 2040, resulting in approximately 1.6 million deaths per year, according to the WHO. This type of cancer is becoming increasingly common in &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/bjs/article/112/7/znaf102/8191209" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;young people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;, and factors including lifestyle play a crucial role. While certain foods can increase the risk of colon cancer, some others can reduce it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="5"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="7"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine eating some delicious snack and protecting yourself from colon cancer. Yes, you read it right. An indulgent snack and its key ingredient are linked to reduced risk and recurrence of colon cancer. An observational study found that the chance of colon cancer recurrence was nearly cut in half in people who eat nuts and nut butter. The findings are published in the &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5891130/#s8" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" styleobj="[object Object]" class="" target="_blank" commonstate="[object Object]" frmappuse="1"&gt;Journal of Clinical Oncology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="12"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in India and it’s fully treatable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The role of nuts&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Basic healthy eating can often be overlooked during cancer treatment. This study demonstrates that a simple dietary change, such as eating tree nuts, may have a significant impact on a patient's long-term survival. Nut consumption and a healthy diet are generally factors that clinicians and patients should perhaps pay attention to as they design the approach to treatment for colorectal cancer," ASCO President Daniel F.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hayes, MD, FACP, FASCO, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="20"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The observational study examined 826 patients with stage III colon cancer. They found that nuts, especially peanuts, had a profound impact on colon cancer. In patients who consumed two ounces or more of nuts per week, they saw a 42% lower chance of cancer recurrence and a 57% lower chance of death than those who did not eat nuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that the benefit of nut consumption was limited to tree nuts in a secondary analysis. These include almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts, cashews, and pecans, among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="27"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Numerous studies in the fields of heart disease and diabetes have shown the benefits of nut consumption, and we felt that it was important to determine if these benefits could also apply to colorectal cancer patients," Temidayo Fadelu, MD, a clinical fellow in medicine at Dana Farber Cancer Institute, and lead author, said. "Patients with advanced disease who benefit from chemotherapy frequently ask what else they can do to reduce their chances of recurrence or death, and our study is an important contribution to the idea that modifying diet and physical activity can be beneficial," Fadelu added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="31"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;They observed no associated reduction in cancer recurrence and death among patients who consumed peanuts or peanut butter. It could be because being legumes, peanuts have a different metabolic composition than tree nuts, the authors said. Also, peanuts are by far the most widely consumed nut in the US.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="33"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients with stage III colon cancer have up to a 70% chance of surviving three years after treatment, which typically includes surgery and/or chemotherapy. Though previous studies have looked at the role of diet as a potential cancer prevention role, this is the first to examine the benefits of nuts in treating colon cancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="37"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="38"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The study&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the study, the researchers analyzed a questionnaire from a CALGB clinical trial of patients with stage III colon cancer that began in 1999. They asked about the patients’ dietary intake, including whether or not patients ate nuts and what types of nuts they consumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="42"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers were eager to know about nut consumption, as it is already linked to lower incidence of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and a reduction in insulin resistance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="44"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="45"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The findings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study focused on the associations between overall nut consumption and just tree nut consumption and the risk of cancer recurrence and death. They found that patients who consumed two or more ounces of all types of nuts per week (19% of all patients in the study) had a 42% lower chance of cancer recurrence and a 57% lower chance of death than those patients who did not eat nuts after completion of their cancer treatment. In people who reported tree nut consumption, the chance of recurrence was 46% lower and the chance of death was 53% lower in those who ate at least two ounces per week, compared to those who didn’t. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="49"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="lOvcW vdo_embedd"&gt;&lt;div class="k7lcu"&gt;&lt;p class="efT4r"&gt;Trump Undergoes Mystery Health Checkup At Walter Reed Amid Growing Speculations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="51"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="52"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are the experts saying?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tree nuts consumption can be crucial in both preventing and cutting the risk of recurrence of colon cancer. "It should be emphasized that the authors are not suggesting that eating nuts should be considered a substitute for standard chemotherapy and other treatments for colon cancer, which have dramatically improved survival. Rather, patients with colon cancer should be optimistic, and they should eat a healthy diet, including tree nuts, which may not only keep them healthier, but may also further decrease the chances of the cancer coming back," Dr. Hayes said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="58"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="60"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to look at the potential positive impact of nut consumption on survival at other stages of colon cancer, particularly stage IV. Ultimately, we need to understand how nuts confer this protective effect, as well as possibly conduct a randomized, controlled clinical trial where diet recommendations are given at the start of the study to prove that tree nuts can reduce recurrence and death after treatment for colon cancer," Dr. Fadelu added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="63"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>The Times of India</author><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 01:31:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMi8AFBVV95cUxQck1lTDdRN25kdm1MT3pNQWR3NUZsaTB3NTd0UVU2ajJJSHZPN0M4aWE0SkJFQUpUekFYbnBZYzdNaEM1Q2pEeVdLQlVKblIzd1JOcEgtNEdMNmVvY0laZVdnR3RiM0tjcGc5NkJ3eG9ROFlXZzFwb2NMOFZPV3YzLU9uSWxZMTN1UXhPS1dUWnVFMnlZSXgxQkRiTFpZXzJ0azZHUDVnMVM1M0p1emVwV2FSSG5JSUVHMl9uemxYYi1iTHVXazNkVUdtcFV5UnZuTlRRT09TbDhXSzF2OXNHOFl1cFlxRHNUaDBwOFdDQzc</guid></item><item><title>又一场大流行即将来临？致命疾病袭击日本，超过4000人住院，学校因...而关闭，最高- india.com</title><link>https://www.india.com/news/world/another-pandemic-coming-deadly-disease-hits-japan-over-4000-hospitalised-due-to-influenza-schools-kindergartens-childcare-centres-closed-highest-case-reported-in-okinawa-prefecture-8127388/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="expandheight"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The world has not yet moved on from the deadly COVID-19 pandemic that caused global shutdowns, left lives in disarray, and millions dead across the planet. Now, as countries continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, Japan is facing another health crisis: a sudden outbreak of seasonal influenza.  Reports suggest that over 4,000 people have already been infected, and the numbers will likely continue to climb as the temperature decreases daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=""&gt; 
            &lt;/p&gt;
           
&lt;p&gt;Japan’s Ministry of Health announced an epidemic on October 3 after 4,030 people were treated for influenza at country-designated medical institutions in the week starting September 22 – an increase of 957 cases from the previous week. Citing Japan’s Ministry of Health, Japan Today reported that this is the second time in 20 years that an early seasonal change has led to a widespread outbreak of the illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;According to the Japan Today report, approximately 3,000 hospitals nationwide reported a combined 4,030 flu patients during the seven-day period through Sunday. The highest number of flu patients per hospital is reported in Okinawa Prefecture. Tokyo and Kagoshima have also witnessed higher numbers of flu patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="v-india-v0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;According to Japan’s Ministry of Health, the number of patients exceeds the epidemic threshold, with an average of 1.04 patients per medical institution. The infection spread rapidly among children. In that same timeframe, 135 schools, kindergartens, and childcare centres were closed due to outbreaks among children, which was three times the number reported in the same week last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="PreferredSources-content"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Add India.com as a Preferred Source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;i class="google-preferred-source-btn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=https://www.india.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img class="lazy" data-src="https://static.india.com/wp-content/themes/icommobile/images/google-preferred-source-btn-mobile.png" src="https://static.india.com/wp-content/themes/icom/images/cwv-icon/1x1.svg" alt="Add India.com as a Preferred Source"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p id="cre_render_news" class="cre_render_news"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Typically, the flu season in Japan occurs from December to March. Last season began in early November, peaked just before New Year’s, and was called over by April. Due to the rising cases, the Ministry has urged the public to exercise caution and practice preventive behaviors, which include handwashing and wearing masks. The specific strain has not been identified yet, and officials have suggested vaccination for young children, the elderly, and/or those with comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While speaking to the South China Morning Post, Professor Yoko Tsukamoto from the Health Sciences University of Hokkaido said, “The flu season has started really early this year, but in the changing global environment this might become a more common scenario.”&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;According to health officials and scientists, there are several reasons behind the surge. One important factor has been the return of mass international tourism in the post-pandemic environment, which has greatly increased the movement of people, and therefore, the movement of viruses, across national borders.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;“We are seeing a greater circulation of people, both in Japan and globally, with people taking the virus to new places, which is another factor behind the virus adapting to new environments,” she further added. With the height of flu season predicted to come earlier than typical, Tsukamoto urged the community to get vaccinated early.&lt;/p&gt;

Immunity has waned and people are getting ill." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;There are actually more than 100 different viruses that cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections, plus some bacterial infections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;Is there more illness than normal?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="https://ukhsa-dashboard.data.gov.uk/" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;Data collection from the UK Health Security Agency&lt;/a&gt; (UKHSA) shows Rhinovirus – what many of us would call the common cold – has been on the increase in recent weeks and seems to be the most common cause of illness at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Covid is also doing the rounds, driven by two new variants – XFG, called Stratus by some, and NB.1.8.1, known as Nimbus. But there is already a high degree of immunity built up in the population meaning, for most, it's a fairly mild infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;There are signs flu may be on the rise too – there has been an increase in the 15-25 age group over the past week - while RSV, which can cause serious illness in young children, also tends to take off in the autumn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"There is often, although not always, a pattern," says Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal, a consultant epidemiologist at UKHSA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"You tend to see Rhinovirus take off first and then RSV," he explains. "Flu tends to come later in December and January. But that's not always the case – and certainly the pandemic disrupted the traditional seasonal trends. What we've seen in the last year or so is those trends return to something like normal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;He says the levels of illnesses at the moment are not particularly high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Covid is above baseline and there's a lot of Rhinovirus around. The uptick in flu in that younger age group has perhaps come a little bit earlier than we would expect, but it is still at a low level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;Is it a cold, flu or Covid?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;The most common symptoms, according to the NHS, are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;b id="colds" class="sc-d16436d-0 kPzeuB"&gt;Colds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 bYhyhr"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Symptoms appear gradually&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Mostly affect nose and throat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Early sign - pressure in your ears&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Chestier, mucus cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;b id="flu" class="sc-d16436d-0 kPzeuB"&gt;Flu&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 bYhyhr"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Comes on suddenly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Feel wiped out&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Fever, muscle aches, exhaustion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Need bed rest&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Dry cough&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;&lt;b id="covid" class="sc-d16436d-0 kPzeuB"&gt;Covid&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul class="sc-6f869981-0 bYhyhr"&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Typical flu symptoms&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Loss of taste of smell&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li class="sc-734a601e-0 NnDUj"&gt;Diarrhoea or tummy upset&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Many of the symptoms between cold, flu and more serious viruses like Covid overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p data-component="subheadline-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 bPbmDW"&gt;&lt;h2 class="sc-f98b1ad2-0 fsBZby"&gt;How can you protect yourself?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div data-component="text-block" class="sc-3b6b161a-0 jdlrvG"&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Respiratory infections can, of course, be really dangerous for vulnerable people - in a bad winter tens of thousands of people can die of flu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;But there is nothing to suggest the respiratory viruses circulating now are causing more serious illness this year in otherwise healthy people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"We all react in different ways – and we don't really understand why," admits Prof Ball. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Of course, age and fitness have a lot to do with it, but sometimes it is just your individual genetics or how tired and rundown you may be, or when you were last exposed to that particular virus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;In terms of protecting yourself, the most important step to take, if you are eligible, is to get vaccinatinated. Shots are being offered for &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-services/vaccination-and-booking-services/get-a-free-rsv-vaccination/" class="sc-f9178328-0 jZoZnB"&gt;flu, Covid and RSV&lt;/a&gt; to protect those who are most at-risk of serious illness, which includes older people and those with certain health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;If you are ill, UKHSA says you can help protect others by washing your hands regularly, especially after coughing or sneezing, staying at home if you can and consider wearing a mask if you do have to go into public places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;Prof Ball says it is right to take precautions to try to protect vulnerable people, but adds if you are healthy and young or of working age, getting the odd respiratory illness is pretty inevitable and not necessarily a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"Most people will get one or two respiratory infections every year. In some ways, it's a good thing when you are a child or healthy adult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="sc-9a00e533-0 bJoRPJ"&gt;"By getting exposed you are building up your immunity through natural infection - so when you are older you hopefully have enough immunity to not get severely ill."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/article&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>BBC</author><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 23:07:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiWkFVX3lxTE1SMWdvdzItbTc5T2lXdml6VERIN25XUHR2YU92NGxNVExPSmg0cEVnMDFRcWYzOVFTYnFPQWwxaWFxUEFvM3VoS0FJOXhwTW5nNHV2eFZFRDZuQdIBX0FVX3lxTE1uTkUtSEVldXB3NTJ0WVR1MVJ4Vml2RW1HNDNUWDl4aXBYZ1NMN24zLTVEWXNfX1NEZzNaODNEQjlVQzFIcmhqWFotUVRMZDU4WDlqclZxaWRiWW5KQ0l3</guid></item><item><title>由哈佛大学训练有素的医生推荐的5种抗衰老补充剂-印度时报</title><link>https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/5-anti-aging-supplements-recommended-by-a-harvard-trained-doctor/photostory/124472716.cms</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="COQxt" data-ua-type="1"&gt;&lt;p&gt;PectaSol is a pure citrus pectin for increased absorption.

It often starts with night blindness and then narrows side vision over years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new mouse study reports that the retina does not passively fade during early stages of this condition. Instead, it changes which cells talk to each other to keep daylight &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/how-tiny-gold-particles-may-help-restore-vision/"&gt;vision&lt;/a&gt; working longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-changes-inside-the-retina"&gt;What changes inside the retina&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bri.ucla.edu/people/alapakkam-sampath/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;Alapakkam P. Sampath, Ph.D.&lt;/a&gt;, of the Jules Stein Eye Institute at the David Geffen School of Medicine at &lt;a href="https://www.uclahealth.org/locations/ucla-stein-eye-institute" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;UCLA&lt;/a&gt;, led the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retina uses two main photoreceptors, rods for dim light and cones for daytime and color. Signals from rods are relayed by &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39775947/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;rod bipolar cells&lt;/a&gt; to downstream neurons, while cones use multiple &lt;a href="https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/cellguide/CL:0000752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;cone bipolar cell&lt;/a&gt; types to carry daytime signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the new work, the rod pathway’s relay neurons began taking input from cones once many rods were lost. That is a rerouting of signals inside a circuit that is normally kept separate in healthy eyes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Our findings show that the retina adapts to the loss of rods in ways that attempt to preserve daytime light sensitivity in the retina,” said A. P. Sampath, Ph.D..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-experimenting-on-the-retina"&gt;Experimenting on the retina&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team used rhodopsin knockout mice, a model in which rod photoreceptors first stop responding to light and then gradually die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers recorded electrical signals from single rod bipolar cells in retinal slices to test whether those cells were now driven by cone inputs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also measured whole retina signals using an &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11554/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;electroretinogram&lt;/a&gt;, a test that sums activity from many cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/molecular-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2023.1153934/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;photopic b-wave&lt;/a&gt; rose in a way consistent with stronger cone driven bipolar cell responses, that evaluates how bipolar cells and Müller glia contribute to this signal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When the usual connections between rod bipolar cells and rods are lost, these cells can rewire themselves to receive signals from cones instead,” said Sampath. The authors then looked for what event triggers that switch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-why-degeneration-flips-the-switch"&gt;Why degeneration flips the switch&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To separate causes, the group tested mice that lacked rod light responses but did not undergo rod death, and mice that lacked the normal rod to rod bipolar synapse. In those models, rod bipolar cells did not show strong cone driven responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independent &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26402607/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; shows that the synapse between rods and rod bipolar cells requires &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/392617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;ELFN1&lt;/a&gt;, a cell adhesion molecule that helps create the primary rod pathway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This background makes it notable that when rods disappear, the relay neurons appear to reach for new cone inputs rather than stay idle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patterns across the data suggest that degeneration itself signals circuits to reconfigure. The switch did not follow from silent rods alone, and it did not follow from a broken rod synapse in the absence of actual cell death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-second-thread-from-2023"&gt;Second thread from 2023&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another line of &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36977418/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; reported that even after severe structural changes, cones and their pathways can still function. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That work showed degenerating cones retain the key ion channels needed to respond to light and keep useful output to later retinal stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combine that result with the new rerouting and a picture emerges. Cones can still respond, and the inner retina can shift to listen to them, which helps explain why many people retain usable daytime &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/clean-air-may-hold-the-key-to-sharper-vision-in-children/"&gt;vision&lt;/a&gt; well into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, the studies point to stepwise adaptation. As rods fail, cone signals carry more of the load, and downstream neurons adjust their wiring to keep those signals moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-what-it-could-mean-for-patients"&gt;What it could mean for patients&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/retinitis-pigmentosa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Retinitis pigmentosa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is rare but not trivial in scale, and families often navigate decades of uncertainty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding that circuits can sustain daylight vision by reconfiguring suggests a practical window for treatments that boost or stabilize cone function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a window could matter for gene therapy, optogenetic strategies, or small molecules that increase cone sensitivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If inner retina neurons are already poised to pass on cone signals, preserving the remaining cone responses may translate into more real world sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical tests already capture the mass signals that reflect bipolar cell activity. Tracking the b-wave under bright light could help scientists see whether a medicine or genetic therapy strengthens the rerouted pathway over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="h-limits-and-next-steps"&gt;Limits and next steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These results come from mice, and that matters. Human retinas share core circuitry but differ in ratios of &lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/news/human-eyes-retina-sync-everything-they-see-before-sending-visual-signals-to-the-brain/"&gt;rods and cones&lt;/a&gt; and in the way daytime signals are pooled, so translation will require careful testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team plans to examine other mutations that cause rod loss to see if the same circuit shift appears. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the pattern holds, it would support the idea that degeneration triggers a broader program of &lt;a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3021747/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;homeostatic plasticity&lt;/a&gt; in the retina that favors preserving daylight function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next challenge is to identify the signals that tell rod bipolar cells to change partners. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clues point to &lt;a href="https://qbi.uq.edu.au/brain-basics/brain/brain-physiology/what-are-glia"&gt;glia&lt;/a&gt; and to factors released by dying cells, and those ideas can now be tested with interventions and noninvasive readouts in living tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study is published in &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982225006736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Current Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like what you read?&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/subscribe/"&gt; Subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for engaging articles, exclusive content, and the latest updates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check us out on&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/earthsnap/"&gt; EarthSnap&lt;/a&gt;, a free app brought to you by&lt;a href="https://www.earth.com/author/eralls/"&gt; Eric Ralls&lt;/a&gt; and Earth.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Earth.com</author><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 21:15:27 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMirAFBVV95cUxPVmV5Z19oaVJpNkxHYkhCbzFoZ0s0SFVtWmlob1YxTGw1MzU2ZnZsT2tTaktwbUdtV09VeDJoUk9VTGFmdXdLZnVCWkMyeVlHckw3eTZHMXdsTjYxcWl5SkFaVzdDbUwtdE94d0FNd29ielZtNlJSblRzNk5RZ0xDZmZtWFo2b2J4blVRMl8xY1NDekdzUFVyNUNwR0huQzR4WXJlZ00tNXczdE5Y</guid></item><item><title>专家透露，阿尔茨海默氏症实际上可能不是脑部疾病- ScienceAlert</title><link>https://www.sciencealert.com/alzheimers-may-not-actually-be-a-brain-disease-reveals-expert</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="post-content"&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of a cure for  &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/go/IaO" class="lar_link lar_link_outgoing" data-linkid="73015" data-postid="177204" rel="nofollow" target="_self"&gt;Alzheimer's&lt;/a&gt; disease is becoming an increasingly competitive and contentious quest, with recent years witnessing several important controversies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/potential-fabrication-research-images-threatens-key-theory-alzheimers-disease"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; magazine&lt;/a&gt; reported that a key &lt;a href="https://doi.org/doi:10.1038/nature04533"&gt;2006 research paper, published in the prestigious journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which identified a subtype of brain protein called beta-amyloid as the cause of Alzheimer's, may have been based on fabricated data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One year earlier, in June 2021, the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/aducanumab-marketed-aduhelm-information"&gt;US Food and Drug Administration had approved aducanumab&lt;/a&gt;, an antibody-targeting beta-amyloid, as a treatment for Alzheimer's, even though the data supporting its use were incomplete and contradictory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some physicians believe aducanumab never should have been approved, while others maintain it should be given a chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Related: &lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/learning-one-word-could-help-prevent-a-third-of-alzheimers-cases"&gt;Learning One Word Could Help Prevent a Third of Alzheimer's Cases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With millions of people needing an effective treatment, why are researchers still fumbling in this quest for a cure for what is arguably one of the most important diseases confronting humankind?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_142437" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-142437" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-642x500.jpg" alt="Clumps of yellow forming among purple neurons" class="size-medium wp-image-142437" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-642x500.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-768x598.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642-600x467.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/AmyloidPlaquesAmongNeurons_R_U_642.jpg 1204w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-142437" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Illustration of beta-amyloid plaques (yellow) amongst neurons.

The need for a new "out-of-the-clump" way of thinking about Alzheimer's is emerging as a top priority in brain science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My laboratory at the Krembil Brain Institute, part of the University Health Network in Toronto, is devising a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/trc2.12283"&gt;new theory of Alzheimer's disease&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on our past 30 years of research, we no longer think of Alzheimer's as primarily a disease of the brain. Rather, we believe that Alzheimer's is principally &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1567205018666211202141650"&gt;a disorder of the immune system within the brain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The immune system, found in every organ in the body, is a collection of cells and molecules that work in harmony to help repair injuries and protect from foreign invaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/spark-into-space-comp?utm_source=promo_launch"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-642x272.jpg" alt="Mid Article Promo Launch" class="alignnone wp-image-177073 size-medium" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-642x272.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-768x326.jpg 768w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch-600x255.jpg 600w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/10/Mid-Article-Promo-Launch.jpg 844w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a person trips and falls, the immune system helps to mend the damaged tissues. When someone experiences a viral or bacterial infection, the immune system helps in the fight against these microbial invaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact same processes are present in the brain. When there is head trauma, the brain's immune system kicks into gear to help repair. When bacteria are present in the brain, the immune system is there to fight back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144645" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144645" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/WhiteBloodCellsImmuneSystem642.jpg" alt="Bright green cells with orange spots in between them" class="size-full wp-image-144645" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/WhiteBloodCellsImmuneSystem642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/WhiteBloodCellsImmuneSystem642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/WhiteBloodCellsImmuneSystem642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144645" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;White blood cells of the immune system, activated to fight a bacterial infection.

It is supposed to be there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When brain trauma occurs or when bacteria are present in the brain, beta-amyloid is a key contributor to the brain's comprehensive immune response. And this is where the problem begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of striking similarities between the fat molecules that make up both the membranes of bacteria and the membranes of brain cells, beta-amyloid cannot tell the difference between invading bacteria and host brain cells, and mistakenly attacks the very brain cells it is supposed to be protecting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This leads to a chronic, progressive loss of brain cell function, which ultimately culminates in dementia – all because our body's immune system cannot differentiate between bacteria and brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When regarded as a misdirected attack by the brain's immune system on the very organ it is supposed to be defending, Alzheimer's disease emerges as an autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many types of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, in which autoantibodies play a crucial role in the development of the disease, and for which steroid-based therapies can be effective. But these therapies will not work against Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain is a very special and distinctive organ, recognized as &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK234155/#"&gt;the most complex structure in the Universe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144646" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144646" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderCoupleReadingABookTogether642.jpg" alt="A senior man and woman looking at a book together" class="size-full wp-image-144646" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderCoupleReadingABookTogether642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderCoupleReadingABookTogether642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/OlderCoupleReadingABookTogether642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144646" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Alzheimer's is arguably one of the most important diseases confronting humankind.

For example, some scientists believe that &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mito.2022.05.001"&gt;Alzheimer's is a disease of tiny cellular structures called mitochondria&lt;/a&gt; – the energy factories in every brain cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mitochondria convert oxygen from the air we breathe and glucose from the food we eat into the energy required for remembering and thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some maintain that it is the end-result of a &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.4103/1673-5374.339476"&gt;particular brain infection&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/prd.12429"&gt;bacteria from the mouth often being suggested as the culprit&lt;/a&gt;. Still others suggest that the disease may arise from an &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/biom12050714"&gt;abnormal handling of metals within the brain&lt;/a&gt;, possibly zinc, copper, or iron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is gratifying to see &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/jnnp-2021-327370"&gt;new thinking about this age-old disease&lt;/a&gt;. Dementia currently affects more than 50 million people worldwide, with a new diagnosis being made every three seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often, people living with Alzheimer's disease are unable to recognize their own children or even their spouse of more than 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's is a public health crisis in need of innovative ideas and fresh directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure id="attachment_144650" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-144650" class="wp-caption aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/YoungPersonKissingASeniorLadyOnTheCheek642.jpg" alt="A young person kissing an older lady on the cheek" class="size-full wp-image-144650" srcset="https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/YoungPersonKissingASeniorLadyOnTheCheek642.jpg 642w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/YoungPersonKissingASeniorLadyOnTheCheek642-533x415.jpg 533w, https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/YoungPersonKissingASeniorLadyOnTheCheek642-600x467.jpg 600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 642px) 100vw, 642px"&gt;&lt;figcaption id="caption-attachment-144650" class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Often, people living with Alzheimer's disease are unable to recognize their own children.

It stopped working due to hardware issues around &lt;a href="https://raf.mod.uk/what-we-do/centre-for-air-and-space-power-studies/aspr/aspr-vol26-iss1-4-pdf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;18 months&lt;/a&gt; after it started operating, and the spacecraft was left to the laws of physics to orbit the Earth – it is now the oldest UK spacecraft still in space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span contenteditable="false" draggable="true" class="fr-video fr-deletable fr-fvc fr-dvb fr-draggable"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t82-QBiBBoQ??si=ZjWSEt_Cvm3cdA9-&amp;amp;wmode=opaque&amp;amp;rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" class="fr-draggable"&gt;VIDEO&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a good idea to check on defunct satellites, to make sure the space debris is not on course to collide with any working satellites or populated areas of the Earth below. In the 1970s, when the satellite was closely tracked, it was in a geostationary arc at a longitude of around 40 East, where it remained when it was decommissioned. Such orbits are subject to gravitational perturbations by the Sun, Earth and Moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Skynet-1A had failed at its operational location of around 40 East, we would now expect it to be oscillating by +/- 35 degrees either side of 75 East," satellite-system engineer Dr Stuart Eves &lt;a href="https://gnosisnetwork.org/blog/the-curious-case-of-skynet-1a-and-why-it-matters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;explains in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; for The Global Network on Sustainability in Space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Except that it isn’t. According to the UK Registry , Skynet-1A is currently sitting very close to the bottom of the other well at 105 West, oscillating by just a couple of degrees."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p id="trendmd-suggestions" data-pid-resource="RRUGNY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="piano-inline"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-pasted="true"&gt;The spacecraft is not where it is supposed to be, according to what we know about orbits, now some 36,000 kilometers (22,369 miles) above the Americas. At some point in the intervening years, the satellite has likely been moved – but nobody appears to know when, who, or why. Tracking of the satellite has been patchy, particularly in the mid-1970s when the maneuver appears to have taken place, and any records of what happened appear to have been lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The satellite, though the UK's first, was built and partly operated by the USA, with both countries sending commands to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A Skynet team from Oakhanger would go to the USAF satellite facility in Sunnyvale (colloquially known as the Blue Cube) and operate Skynet during 'Oakout'," Rachel Hill, a PhD student from University College London searching the National Archives for clues, told the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpwrr58801yo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;. "This was when control was temporarily transferred to the US while Oakhanger was down for essential maintenance.

In its current orbit, the satellite could pose problems for other nearby satellites in geostationary orbit. Should it collide with another, the question of who issued the order to fire the satellite's thrusters could decide which country is &lt;a href="https://gnosisnetwork.org/blog/the-curious-case-of-skynet-1a-and-why-it-matters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;held liable&lt;/a&gt; for the damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em data-pasted="true"&gt;An earlier version of this article was published in 2024.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>IFLScience</author><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 19:20:50 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">CBMiugFBVV95cUxQTzB2TW1JbUk3WU50RERhZWpGbHEzci1DSHV3MUJSeW9HbG9tdy1qaUl1YlY0d181RHF5anM1azJkSHRkNncyWDFVWG9ZTGRoY0pXTVpfYXBBSU91TDQ2eHpoRDN6QXJXYW13YzFKUTU1V2hVZUpmeldvU0JiV04zdFRDeEs2UGItenl4MW5nTWdKLWZTekRHWV9QRlh2ZTBpd3p6am5hbmctczVnQnZKRFBxejFZMlQ2c0E</guid></item><item><title>我们在过去30年中对自恋心理学的了解- PsyPost</title><link>https://www.psypost.org/what-weve-learned-about-the-psychology-of-narcissism-over-the-past-30-years/</link><description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="content-inner "&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve probably seen the word “narcissist” thrown around online in headlines, on dating apps or in therapy-themed TikToks. But the label that people often unthinkingly slap on toxic bosses or reality TV villains hides a much more complicated psychological picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychologists have studied narcissism for many years, but over time, our understanding has evolved. One of the biggest changes is that today, narcissism is no longer seen as just grandiosity, arrogance or egotism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early scientific descriptions of narcissism &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735807001602?via%3Dihub"&gt;focused on dominance&lt;/a&gt;, ambition and self-importance, all of which are traits associated with traditional masculine stereotypes. That meant narcissistic tendencies in women were often misread or overlooked. When those traits &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0038231"&gt;show up as emotional sensitivity&lt;/a&gt;, insecurity or relational manipulation, they sometimes still are misdiagnosed as anxiety, mood disorders or &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1090746/full"&gt;borderline personality disorder&lt;/a&gt; traits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most extreme and persistent forms of narcissism can sometimes be diagnosed as narcissistic personality disorder. This condition was added to the &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2013-14907-000"&gt;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&lt;/a&gt;, the American Psychiatric Association’s diagnostic manual, in 1980. But most people with narcissistic tendencies won’t meet the threshold for a diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So what does the research actually say?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Narcissism in general is &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09637214211044109"&gt;now understood&lt;/a&gt; as a complex set of personality characteristics that can show up in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychologists had long suspected that there might be different kinds of narcissism, but it wasn’t until 1991 – when researcher Paul Wink and his colleagues &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.61.4.590"&gt;presented a model&lt;/a&gt; including grandiose and vulnerable subtypes – that they were more formally recognised. Although there are other models, this remains one of the more popular approaches to understanding narcissistic tendencies in the wider population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09637214211044109"&gt;2021 review&lt;/a&gt; by US psychologist Joshua Miller and his colleagues pulled together decades of research to offer one of the most authoritative summaries of how psychologists now understand narcissism. It explains that narcissism has a common foundation, which includes things such as self-importance and entitlement. It then branches into different forms of narcissism, such as grandiosity, antagonism and vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers now often use the terms &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735807001602?via%3Dihub"&gt;grandiose and vulnerable&lt;/a&gt; to describe two major forms of narcissism. One person with narcissistic traits may be bold with high levels of grandiose traits, confidence and emotional resilience. Another might be defensive, anxious and hypersensitive to criticism. Both show signs of narcissistic self-focus, but they end up looking quite different in how they experience and express emotion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S019188692100773X?via%3Dihub"&gt;2022 research paper&lt;/a&gt; I wrote with colleagues, we carried out the first meta-analysis examining how narcissistic traits relate to the ability to control one’s emotions. The results showed that vulnerable narcissism is consistently associated with greater emotional difficulty, which means these people might find it harder to keep their emotions in check.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, people with high scores on vulnerable narcissism scales are more likely to rely on suppression. Suppression is a strategy that people use to hide or inhibit their emotional expressions, and has been linked to &lt;a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.85.2.348"&gt;poorer wellbeing&lt;/a&gt;. On the surface, suppression might sound like self-control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some situations, it can be. For example, keeping a lid on your emotions when your boss is yelling at you. But trying to mute emotional expression without addressing the underlying emotions increases stress when it becomes our default strategy. It can worsen mental and physical health over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, grandiose narcissism wasn’t linked with emotion regulation difficulties. In fact, several of the studies included in our analysis suggest that people with higher levels of grandiose traits may not experience as much emotional distress in the first place. This challenges the popular idea among researchers that people who exhibit narcissistic tendencies are also experiencing emotional instability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Emotional intelligence and self-perception&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The differences between forms of narcissism show up in emotional intelligence research as well. In a &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17540739211014585"&gt;2021 systematic review&lt;/a&gt; on narcissism and emotional intelligence, my colleagues and I found that people with grandiose traits often said they were good at understanding and managing emotions. For instance, how well they think they can handle anger or recognise other’s emotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when their skills were tested using emotion tasks (such as recognising facial expressions or identifying the best way to respond to an emotional situation), their performance didn’t always match up with how skilled they said they were. This is consistent with a &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01606/full"&gt;2018 study&lt;/a&gt; which also found that people with grandiose tendencies rated themselves as emotionally skilled but performed worse on skill-based emotional intelligence tasks compared to other participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, people with vulnerable narcissistic traits tend to rate themselves lower in emotional intelligence, and seem to genuinely struggle more with managing emotions in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;So what should we make of all this?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s time to move beyond the pop-psych trend of labelling difficult people as narcissists. Narcissism isn’t about taking too many selfies. And no, the partner who ghosted you or the colleague who dominates meetings isn’t necessarily high in narcissistic traits either – no matter how much we might like to complain about them over coffee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These kinds of casual diagnoses aren’t just unhelpful, they’re often wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Narcissism is a complex psychological pattern that can show up in different ways and can reflect a deeper struggle with things such as self-esteem, emotion regulation and social connection. Understanding this doesn’t excuse people’s bad behaviour – not at all. But it does help us look past the stereotypes to get a clearer picture of what narcissistic traits look like in everyday life.&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;img decoding="async" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/258505/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;&lt;img class="lazyload" decoding="async" src="" data-src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/258505/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is republished from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com"&gt;The Conversation&lt;/a&gt; under a Creative Commons license.

The Maricopa County Environmental Services Vector Control Division said they’ve been receiving more complaints in the last 10 days compared to all of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Division manager John Townsend said they’ve received almost a thousand community complaints in the last week or so, bringing them up to about 3,000 for the calendar year so far. All of 2024, Townsend said, they received around 1,000 community complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They’ve been very small, and it’s been a lot at once. They bit me up. This is the most I've ever been bit by mosquitoes in my life,” said Phoenix resident Tayja.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In the video player above, find out the difference between the mosquitoes you see during the day and at night and what you can do to protect yourself. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Twenty-eight of Japan’s 47 prefectures have reported rising cases. Particularly in Tokyo, Okinawa and Kagoshima at least 135 schools and childcare centres have been temporarily shut down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="14"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class="cdatainfo modify_cdata_list_style id-r-component " data-pos="15"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Warning of a fast-evolving virus&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="16"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div data-pos="0" class="id-r-component QbQNS undefined

Professor Yoko Tsukamoto of the Health Sciences University of Hokkaido spoke to the Japanese media, saying, “The flu season has started really early this year, but in the changing global environment this might become a more common scenario.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="21"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tsukamoto advised common precautions like vaccination, wearing masks, washing hands regularly and avoiding spreading infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="23"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have been urging the vulnerable population including the elderly, children and those with pre-existing conditions to get vaccinated immediately. “For most healthy individuals, the flu may be unpleasant but not dangerous. But for vulnerable groups, early vaccination is crucial,” added Tsukamoto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span class="id-r-component br" data-pos="25"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description><author>Times of India</author><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 17:11:00 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="" length="10000" type="image/png"></enclosure><guid isPermaLink="true">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</guid></item><item><title>25年前，果园港的人预计会得阿尔茨海默氏症。为什么不呢？ -《西雅图时报》</title><link>https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/port-orchard-man-was-expected-to-get-alzheimers-25-years-ago-why-hasnt-he/</link><description>&lt;a href="https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiwAFBVV95cUxNSUdCMGdOaEVFWGdDSVppbjdOYkZjZE1KdGZ2RkZUNFVQVU5zYjNUbWh5NmlMRDNrcDkwSS0zSjhBaTdHR0pZS1hJWEV1OTdCeV9fUEpuR09vV0llbXdWaXJhcV84T3kya1ZLQVZaNEVvZXRLSGlUSVZVNmNmTFJnQ3Jjd2lHV0swV1FKOHZUOVB4ZS05Wk01S2lFTGFrd3pETzU1VFJRR3pBN291UzRKQ2Z2UTZ4YWhpYU5MdVpSQ2o?oc=5" target="_blank"&gt;Port Orchard man was expected to get Alzheimer’s 25 years ago.
